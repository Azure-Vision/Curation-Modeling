pokemon,removed,lucario must be black
pokemon,removed,cant assume his gender then
pokemon,removed,wailord is oblivious
pokemon,removed,every are you assuming that there is a finite amount of genders
pokemon,removed,they are sjws will say otherwise
pokemon,removed,its to be politically correct
pokemon,removed,are you implying there are only two triggered
pokemon,removed,theres a popular social movement predominantly among the politically leftleaning to distinguish between the two the claimis that sex is what your biology is whereas gender is what you feel you are the terms are designed to be inclusive of transgender folks who are biologically male but have an intense yearning to be female and vice versa and certainly they have some good points the fact that some people have these intense yearnings suggests that a person might be able to feel a gender in a way that contradicts their physical body personally though im not fond of it im all for undoing societal gender roles but i think that trying to tie a persons mind and for lack of a better term soul to the idea of gender is a bit absurd
pokemon,removed,did you just assume my pokemons gender
pokemon,removed,you wouldnt be here if you had said condition lmao
pokemon,removed,youve been brainwashed i promise you can beat what they told you you are i was told the same thing
pokemon,removed,dont listen to the weirdos it totally is
pokemon,removed,there are only two genders get over it
pokemon,removed,theyre the same thing
pokemon,removed,yes they are in recent years psychologists and whatever have started using gender as a way to describe your mental sex however dont feel required to use it that way
pokemon,removed,had to make sure i wasnt on tumblr
pokemon,removed,yeah this post is blatant pedophilia lol
pokemon,removed,this way if defining gender is completely new last years historically gender is synonymous with sex
pokemon,removed,no by saying sex instead of gender you are actually not even attempting to assume it
pokemon,removed,the spoiler tags work well on every other sub except this one are the majority of you people on this sub also on the spectrum too every other post is someones take on the new starters everyone has drawn a shitty drawing going look at what i drew no one cares youre an artist thats great there should be one thread where every person that feels they can only express themselves through drawing the same starter over and over can post as many times as they like so that it doesnt litter the front page its been non stop artwork and it all looks the same heres what i think the evolutions will look like ok you wont find out until november are you going to keep speculating until then hopefully this garbage dies down within a week otherwise this sub is going to suck so much anus i know im right because whenever anyone voices their opinion on how hysterical this sub becomes over the tiniest announcement or leak they get downvoted there are tv show and sports subs that do a better job of composing themselves over pertinent news and im including the walking dead sub too take the artwork that someone with psych issues composed and stick it all one thread have the circlejerk there keep the sub organized so that if new information does come out its not blocked out with red markings and assumed to be more shitty artwork if you dont get it by now i think all your artwork is shitty and unnecessary

pokemon,removed,you know i completely agree but i think you missed the way that popplio stands for trump and really feel as if his stature just shows that nintendo really wants trump to be the next president and i also think that popplio represents the sexuality of transpedobiasexual and i really appreciate pokemons care for it

pokemon,removed,another printed bulbasaur planter how original
pokemon,removed,are you complaining about the new gens being more simplistic or less simplistic because ponyta is extremely simple as you said but then you use that as a negative attribute for grotle and skiddo i mean in some ways recent pokemon have gotten more in terms of design compare the dragonite line to the hydreigon line
pokemon,removed,i cant read it the image is too small
pokemon,removed,i always new there was something about early gen designs that i liked yeah they are simple but more detailed
pokemon,removed,tbh the new cartoony style int that bad i like the pokemon on the right just as much as the ones on the left genwunners just need to stop whining tho
pokemon,removed,has the person writing this ever seen a slug goodra has pretty realistic slug like textures
pokemon,removed,whats so complex about muk linework is this image supposed to be a joke
pokemon,removed,oh yeah like voltorb such an amazing design and its evolution yeah just turned upside down s
pokemon,removed,seems whoever made this image has ever heard of a nudibranch
pokemon,removed,the complaints on this are really inconsistent and not really complaints like yeah maybe newer pokemon are more cartoony but a lot of gen pokemon were literally just real world animalsthings and in my opinion thats rubbish yay pidgey is soooooooooo exciting
pokemon,removed,youre picking out pokemon that back up your argument look at haxorus zekrom reshiram kyurem xerneas yveltal mega blaziken tyrantrum all these have good detailed designs while some in gen are so basic and cartoony
pokemon,removed,can someone please draw these but with switched styles for example fearow with simple wing shape fuzzy darumaka etc
pokemon,removed,its cool to see how pokemon is actually just getting more creative usually you hear that the new pokemon are just a dog or just a rat but to be honest it was more like that in generation thy really didnt hit a stride until generation three when they started making a lot of great looking pokemon that werent inspired by any real life creatures
pokemon,removed,are you trying to say that gen pokemon are better because im getting a gen one pokemon are boring and that makes them better vibe
pokemon,removed,go monkey human fighter i choose you boring purple lady go do you get my point
pokemon,removed,thats only because the p repeats you dont see dipept
pokemon,removed,nostalgia glasses
pokemon,removed,without agreeing with your implied conclusion that new designs are categorically worse i do find it interesting how the general style has appeared to shift over the years

pokemon,removed,say will the top commenters and posters get a pokéball background
pokemon,removed,ken sugimori isnt the only one doing the art anymore
pokemon,removed,i dont dislike the new designs but i can understand what the creator was trying to say i mean strawmanning his arguments doesnt helpif you actually look at the designs it is very clear that a lot of the new pokemon are combinations of ovals not that being composed of a bunch of ovals is bad but it would be nice to see some more realistic textures like feathers on birds fur on animals leaves on plants etc once again the new designs arent bad but i think some of them could have had a bit more detail and smoother colour transitions that said i think the cutesy designs are completely fine the way they are theyre meant to be cartoony the darumaka description is a bit unfair too since its

pokemon,removed,i know rpokemon isnt really the place for this but why brexit came about because we have an elected government that has to abide by the rules of an unelected government the uk was never fully invested in the eu anyway proven by the rejection of the euro membership has been nothing but a drain on country funding because we are one of the wealthiest members would you rather your tax go to improving the nhs or bailing out a foreign bank because they didnt learn their lesson in and still offer subprime lending it would be nice if we could join the handful of countries in the eea but statements from eu leaders show that they dont want that and have really bordered on undemocratic if you were a victim of racism following the referendum i apologise but otherwise i fail to understand how you can hate your country when negotiations havent even started yet

pokemon,removed,team skull in general has been amazing theyre exactly what ive wanted since team rocket a bunch of doucebags who dont even intimidate the locals at one point they even mention theyre not trying to take over the world or use a legendary as if game freaks fully aware were sick of megalomaniacs gladions reminiscent of jackass rivals from the first two games who i loved to hate as you should with a rival god i hope they stay like this throughout the game
pokemon,removed,ah damn that wait must be annoying yeah ill be staying up till midnight tommorow for sure and if the game isnt out at in the estore ill be triggered haha
pokemon,removed,are there any codes left for little old me
pokemon,removed,nice lie
pokemon,removed,wishiwashi came close to doing that with my team i didnt realized once i crossed a certain point itd force me into the trial and i had no electric or grass types fuck you alomomola for having decent defense and the ability to heal wishiwashi
pokemon,removed,lusamine and lillie went to live to poképelago where the poképelago guy married lusamine and adopted lillie but really everyones related in alola
pokemon,removed,maybe you should learn enough about the game to know that its called alolan before you critique it
pokemon,removed,shuckle dont cuckle
pokemon,removed,or the postelite four scene where lille sneaks you off to a cave while no one notices and then it pans to the sky for five seconds they boned
pokemon,removed,explains while theres always a shithead rival who takes this shit too seriously
pokemon,removed,it was funny how in the first fight with guzma it seemed like that he knew what he was doing but in reality he never thought out how his pokemons abilities could alter his playstyle his golisopod actually maxed out all of his attack stat with swords dance while i kept trying to sucker punch him thinking that he wouldve been done with one or two then when he actually went to attack i sucker punched him one more time and the emergency exit triggered making all those boosts for naught
pokemon,removed,the fact remains you had enough spare time to play this entire game in a couple of days cry all you want but your actions and whining about the content not being suitable for you make it obvious to everyone outside of a couple internet dweebs that youre a no life loser bud
pokemon,removed,no need to be a little bitch im not the one bitching about gf not making more alolan forms
pokemon,removed,arent you a unique little snowflake
pokemon,removed,their economic recovery plan is trickle down economics based on a kid walking around the islands dont tell trump
pokemon,removed,yeah people who are abused as kids generally turn out to be totally normal not pedophiles rapists murderers or self wound inflicting emo kids that is if they dont commit sudoko first
pokemon,removed,agreed the game is still stupid easy i beat both those totems with just snorlax game is still so easy and this is stupid to complain about
pokemon,removed,why are half of them
pokemon,removed,someone needs bleach
pokemon,removed,c n cvvv gx cco gr u gugj v v hcccccccchcccgffccccyfcffc cgx

pokemon,removed,the ability to danceheres a youtube video to show my idea if you cant get the videowell then im sorry
pokemon,removed,will the subreddit be hosting another rpokemon draws pokemon event soon now that were well into sun moon it was a really successful event and tonnes as fun as someone who used to contribute more oc pokemon art back in the day getting assigned a random pokemon provided a fresh challenge and new motivation not to mention looking through the final album of different mediums styles and techniques was awesome if it is to be done again i believe the entire pokedex should be included thats because sun moon didnt have a huge pokedex and to allow people to try a new pokemon or get others to participate who missed out last time and in the unlikely event you get assigned the same pokemon well maybe you can try a different style or see how much youve improved in your drawing id love to see the event again it would break the monotony of all the draw a pokemon a day challenges and so forth
pokemon,removed,meanwhile people post pictures of malasada for days on end after the sunmoon launch and none of those get taken down this sub is trash im just going to unsub now later nerds
pokemon,removed,youre both wasting your time on a video game website in the middle of the night in this part of the world you both need to step back and chill
pokemon,removed,i would rather support httppocketmonstersfansubsblogspotcl than crunchyroll
pokemon,removed,i have one at httpswwwetsycomukshopowldinnerparty but theres rarely anything on it i only finish anything that i can sell every couple of months
pokemon,removed,someday this will end
pokemon,removed,i know how you should draw them giggity
pokemon,removed,my sister in law makes and sells these httpswwwfacebookcomshadowboxboutique
pokemon,removed,mobs spoken and theyre speaking like genwunners theres a reason your lot keeps getting turned away no one wants kanto because kantos in like games
pokemon,removed,thank you yes my etsy is tigersworkshopetsycom
pokemon,removed,lol who the fuck cares you play a game and youre blind its honestly not that impressive when youve done something on par with andrea bocelli or derek rabelo come back but just playing a video game doesnt make you special kiddo
pokemon,removed,theres of these fuckin things now they should have stopped when there were enough eevees to fill your partybtw nice picture
pokemon,removed,anyone but verlisify
pokemon,removed,im going to use my gas chambers to charmeleons of jews
pokemon,removed,if you liked the first i think youll love shadows of almia you may want to try it on an emulator or something its really worth it shadows of almia is my favourite out of the three the difficulty has been decreased since the first game there are references to past games in soa and guardian signs the one so it should be convenient to play them in release order
pokemon,removed,if you liked the first i think youll love shadows of almia you may want to try it on an emulator or something its really worth it shadows of almia is my favourite out of the three the difficulty has been decreased since the first game there are references to past games in soa and guardian signs the one so it should be convenient to play them in release order
pokemon,removed,i honestly think its verlisifys fault he did a a reeeeeeal scummy thing where he had a giveaway of dittoes named and all that when he just caught them with like not even trying to iv chain them and then he got all angry when people were saying dude what the fuck he did it because anyone should know that a ditto online is hacked but anyone who has hacks available wouldnt trade for one in his act of rightnessness bs he got a most likely legitimate player to give up a buzzswole i stopped watching after that
pokemon,removed,is there a place to read the adventures manga online
pokemon,removed,also my fc is ign tahj
pokemon,removed,apparently scumbag verlis is trading bad dittos named iv to punish people for wanting genned stuff so beware of that too or at least he was at one point
pokemon,removed,he has some serious pull with the mods here
pokemon,removed,same here xd
pokemon,removed,go back where you came from newfag
pokemon,removed,weve stickied this post for visibility as we are getting a ridiculous amount of reposts please stop were drowning in so many new posts that youd think were still in hoenn
pokemon,removed,fedora tipping instensifies
pokemon,removed,you know what youre right i had a nasty tone when i wrote that reply i had just woken up my cat was being a dick and i didnt want to go to class i should have phrased it more nicely however i do stand by the basic sentiment making a joke is hardly clutching ones pearls perhaps by explaining the joke to the less welltraveled it came out sounding more serious than it was perhaps its no longer socially acceptable to make even the least derogatory of gay jokes anymore though i feel as a gay person that it isnt societys place to determine what is offensive to me on my behalf maybe they internet was right all along and we need a fucking sarcmark i dont know im tired and at a twoyear low point in a depression ive been battling for twenty years so i dont feel like exacerbating it with the knowledge that somewhere someone on the internet thinks im a dick so im sorry that i was in fact a little bit of a dick
pokemon,removed,all the names i want to use are not allowed since when is pussyhands obscene
pokemon,removed,i dont get it there has been a good vibe in this discussion with people commenting on the cool little touches in the game the mods made a mistake with this one
pokemon,removed,toxapexcelesteelchansey core makes me want to cry fuck you if you use that
pokemon,removed,lol quality shitpost

pokemon,removed,solgaleo and lunala cant be legendary pokémon because they are evolution of cosmog
pokemon,removed,i shouldnt have to i understand every game needs a story but i cant be the only one who thinks this every npc i talk to babys you and forces you to do things what happened to exploring the world of pokemon and finding things out on your own just my opinion ive loved pokemon all my life and i enjoy the new game mechanics i just find im spending more time reading than battlingcatching
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,wheres beast balls seribi doesnt really have exact locations
pokemon,removed,am i the only one who cried a little bit at the ending when lillie left and that last photo at the end of the credits
pokemon,removed,i do
pokemon,removed,just remember that alola golem is not your friend i hate it i feel like game freak did alola forms just to degrade some pokémon alola muk looks like a pile of ice cream alola persian looks like a cat with autism alola dugtrio thats all that needs to be said alola golem looks like a crack addict
pokemon,removed,but if you choose female you cant have the totally obvious romance with lillie
pokemon,removed,well not really because you hate memes but ok
pokemon,removed,i shouldnt have to carry a shops worth of potions to get through a fucking forest implying you should ever not carry dozens of potions
pokemon,removed,yes it did you have no idea what youre talking about
pokemon,removed,with a response like that no way in hell youve been playing since gen hell youre probably fucking cry baby throwing tantrums i bet youve been playing pokemon since hgss
pokemon,removed,as you already got possible solutions for most your problems ill just add the last one pokemon cant call for help while statused so you hit them with a sleep or paralyze

pokemon,removed,well thats a nice daily dose of autism
pokemon,removed,your best bet would probably be to download a gameboy or gameboy advanced emulator thats compatible with your macbook and finding roms of the original games visualboyadvanced is pretty much the goto gbgba emulator these days
pokemon,removed,when does pokebank come out s
pokemon,removed,as a clash royale player i would find it an insult to be named after that trashcan on wheels
pokemon,removed,i wonder how soon we can get a cosmog plush
pokemon,removed,youre just going to keep reposting this arent you
pokemon,removed,i cant argue so im ignoring you
pokemon,removed,so you understand ivs and nature good evs are completely separate basically ill try to keep this both as short and as complete as possible dont quote me on some of the exact numbers im going off memory this may be longish your pokemon has a bunch of ev points up to capped to per stat whenever you catch or hatch a pokemon it starts with zero ev values you can see them pressing y on the stat summary screen yellow is unmaxed sparkling means that one stat has been maxed and once it turns cyan youve hit the maximum total cap there are several ways to gain ev values defeat pokemon or use the xp share every pokemon species has an xp yield a default value of a certain ev it will give you defeating a zubat for example gives your pokemon speed ev in addition to xp points with the right application of modifiers you can grind to max a pokemons evs fairly quickly the pokerus condition doubles any evs a pokemon gains power items bought for bp cause a pokemon to gain extra evs for a certain stat when they gain xp sos battles yield doubleish evs so by giving a pokemon pokerus having it hold a power item and getting into an sos battle you can very quickly ev train it if youre playing orasxy horde battles are viable instead of sos provided you have surf or something since you ko so fast it basically makes up for not getting the sos bonus assuming sumo you can throw a pokemon in isle evelup under one of the stat training regimens i believe once you develop the island a single stat can be maxed with sessions which takes about a passive day if you use berries while slower than sos chaining you can train up to pokemon at once without even having the game on so its a good idea if you have boxes of stuff you plan to train eventually feed your pokemon vitamins protein iron etc or wings these are limited as i think they only get a stat about halfway to max before they refuse to work if in sumo i think there are vendors you can buy in festival plaza that cause pokemon to gain evs out of all the methods this is the one id be least likely to use unless i had extra plaza currency or was in a hurry if you accidentally give your pokemon evs in the wrong stat they can be erased the berries in sm route increase happiness in exchange for lowering evs of a particular stat by points you can farm these in pokepelago once you get a few to start so if i accidentally trained my snorlax in speed say i just feed it tamato berries until its evs hit zero and i cant anymore then retrain in the correct stat ueonatargaryen
pokemon,removed,racist fucker
pokemon,removed,no it doesnt sometimes the theory was wrong
pokemon,removed,continuing my quest to trace the first ftfy
pokemon,removed,fine not sharing anything here then maybe ill have someone to discuss with once the pokémon go comes out and ill meet people irl since apparently sharing amazing welcome back to this game moments is also against rules so fuck you mod for ruining my one happy moment been stressful enough without this and now i cant even fucking share stuff in reddit even just want to scream fuck you so badly
pokemon,removed,to the people whining about it fuck you get over it already
pokemon,removed,apparently space logic beat out sun fire
pokemon,removed,no im not
pokemon,removed,with no basis
pokemon,removed,devs who have been doing this for years vs some angry fan who thinks he know better brat
pokemon,removed,somebody already posted an explanation on here regarding solgaleos typing lol perhaps you should look at that before getting so upset about it as for rotomdex to each their own also its really not nice of you to call people fanboys for having different opinions than you
pokemon,removed,personally i think the lion should have been psychicfire but gamefreak has their reasons additionally the rotomdex is neat in my opinion its very rotomlike to me i dont really care for the design i actually just like the idea more than its design but i mean hey it looks like a rotom so kuddos to gamefreak there
pokemon,removed,youre complaining about fanboys who defend decisions no matter how stupid with no real basis and yet here you are complaining without giving any basis except i was expecting blahblahblah your response below that explanation is utter bs also has no basis are you expecting people to agree with you when you give no reason to both solgaleo and lunaala are psychic psychictype is associated with space it makes sense as a shared typing there are several reasons steel makes sense the most widespread two being a lion eating a sun related to alchemy and producing metals and supernovas producing iron reusing types isnt really something to complain about im not sure where to start with your thing about rotom pokedex being a terrible idea like everything else you gave it no basis rotom pokedex is a fun new idea and it can act as a cute thing to pull kids in
pokemon,removed,but thats the thing no one knows whether or not its a bad decision yet thats what i meant when i said you were being overly critical youre already completely shutting out the idea of rotomdex based on what a thought
pokemon,removed,fire doesnt really seem to fit solgaleo its too white and mechanical for it to have fire as one of its types steel wouldve been my second guess because of how heavy metals are produced in stars during supernovas i am a bit disappointed that it doesnt get some immunity to fire with flash fire or anything hopefully theres more to their abilities than what we were initially told lunala seems fine being a ghost but i predicted fairyflying
pokemon,removed,how many fan boys are in rpokemon uh i dunno all of them
pokemon,removed,if you dont like it dont buy the game
pokemon,removed,since the mods are hitler is literally solgaleo
pokemon,removed,we still dont know enough there are also the weakness to ghost also rule
pokemon,removed,pokemon predicts trump as president
pokemon,removed,i k ow about sexualising and rule shit but falling in love thatd be one of the most saddest things ive hear in a while
pokemon,removed,i swear to god these are getting retarded
pokemon,removed,character selection is pure filth couldnt even tell the gender do the character i chose i highly doubt chances are youre making shit up just for the sake of whining unless you yourself are a autistic year old as you do eloquently out it its fairly obvious which is the girl and which is the guy
pokemon,removed,shouldnt have leaked the game also if you dont wanna get spoiled dont go to the giant pokemon forum ya dummy
pokemon,removed,fuck you
pokemon,removed,were not allowed to ask for trades on here are we not that i was going to or anything
pokemon,removed,judging by your post history youre a complete moron nothing but downvotes im going to stop replying to you you clearly dont want to listen bye
pokemon,removed,mods are lame as fuck
pokemon,removed,man love you for doing this its really helpful my fc
pokemon,removed,please save one for me as my cant connect to the internet for the next hours
pokemon,removed,i cannot tell if this is a shitpost or comedy gold or an anime plot or possibly some combination of the three
pokemon,removed,i figured cuz its a slowpoke that it would qualify as pokémon related but i would understand if the mods deleted it
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,triggered weaboo screeching
pokemon,removed,theyre both on httpwwwitvcomhubpokemon but youll need to look like youre from the uk so just get a free vpn cant seem to find episode and in english though maybe the dubbed versions havent been released yet
pokemon,removed,when nebby evolves into solgaleolunala our character opens hisher mouth
pokemon,removed,game lags even in battles not even the most expensive pc with the max configuration for pokemon sm on citra would be able ton handle it
pokemon,removed,can you guys add me
pokemon,removed,well duh
pokemon,removed,this triggered me enough to reply three days late it cant be rusaemfirelegr when emerald came out last dude
pokemon,removed,anybody here want to share a paleuaus arceus codes i would love one pm me the code please thank you in advance

pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,hey guys does anyone have a spare destiny knot i searched for days straigth but my meowths cant seem to pick one up i cant really offer to much got like leftovers if someone is intrested or some evostones hit me up if youre willing to trade
pokemon,removed,its like some sort of autistic hybrid of crash bandicoot and shadow the hedgehog
pokemon,removed,i didnt know pokemon can be gay
pokemon,removed,if i had to criticize its that we didnt get to first base with lillie i mean when shes talking to you after you face tapu koko perhaps shes only about to say shes leaving for kanto but i say she was leaning in for some intimacy
pokemon,removed,what the actual fuck are you even talking about
pokemon,removed,i completely forgot about the genesect giveaway this monthdoes anybody have an extra code they can help me out with
pokemon,removed,kanto is racist gsc proved that with how much everyone there called you out for being a johto boy lilly is probably dead in some kanto ditch under cycling road
pokemon,removed,feminism
pokemon,removed,i am looking for a code if anyone has an extra one i am interested thanks sorry if this is considered begging i am new to the reddit community
pokemon,removed,you triggered me by saying beldum holy moly
pokemon,removed,any way to play redblue on an iphone without a jailbreak
pokemon,removed,yeah
pokemon,removed,bruh so much alluded to kukui being a powerful trainer nearly all of his old allies commented on either how he could have been a captain or how he was basically an alolan champion either way kukui is not the champion in the traditional sense his title is pokemon professor and you the trainer are called the first champion kukui is actually just fighting you for the title secondly only one generation had the rival be the champion every single other one had somebody else as champion youre honestly exaggerating too much about being champion there was never a game where something was at stake if you lost you lose then you try again how is that any different it seems like youre honestly nitpicking first you claim kukui became champion outta nowhere then when somebody said you were wrong you go into this shpeal of why does he deserve it i dont know how about the fact that hes a strong fucking trainer thats literally as simple as it is same with blue he became champion cause he was strong only difference is he grew with you while kukui and every other champion has already grown
pokemon,removed,not sure why the guide was deleted it is a pretty good way to max your legendaries anyone have a rare kitchen by any chance fc
pokemon,removed,although that would be interesting to go around killing kids looking for a shiny
pokemon,removed,tries to post about a silly fail that i had while iv chaining mods remove it okay i guess it was just kinda declarative sees a post on the sub thats a lot like my old one in bulletpoint form even less open to discussion it hasnt been removed like mine was it has over upvotes
pokemon,removed,maybe if you nerds didnt take a kids game so seriously this wouldnt be an issue design isnt a problem its all the tryhard neckbeards that are the problem
pokemon,removed,watwhatwhat your not allowed to have opinions different than most people this is an outrage
pokemon,removed,ayyyyyyy lmao
pokemon,removed,i did just launch my etsy store a few weeks ago wwwetsycomshopgeeksteel id love to do some more pokemon and pair it with the crazy colors and textures ive got
pokemon,removed,does anyone know a good way i could watch the indigo league anime in japanese with english subtitles id love to see the anime call magmar boober p
pokemon,removed,i think a snorlax cosplay would have been better for you
pokemon,removed,whats the deal with cosplayers and eye contacts it doesnt make it better it just makes you look like some sort of weird alien except for that the only thing having to do with lillie is nebby and the clothes everything else from the attitude to the bad is just out of place but hey the clothes are pretty nice
pokemon,removed,if i recall correctly the rom is the same what they did is overlay a patch file to run at the start of the game that alters sprites events and etc as needed on the other hand the emulator used for the ignores invalid opcodes which alters a few aspects of the game if you are using glitches
pokemon,removed,i dont think the anime gives a fuck about plot holes id make a list for you but im lazy and im sure someone else will but good find
pokemon,removed,idk how it works on reddit but fucking furries is swearing allowed
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,so true
pokemon,removed,httpswwwfacebookcomthebestpokemon
pokemon,removed,i didnt know that theres actually a way i can do actual clear screenshotsrecordings of the game on my so thats possible i thought that the only way to do that was limited to playing on roms on the computer there have been huge steps forward taken in this field in the past few weeks capture cards that involve hving your hard modded have existed for quite some time but are of course extremely expensive they predate the only emulator by quite a long way you can take screenshots just with homebrew thanks to a program called ntr you can now stream video footage from your to your router to your pc from where you can record it i recommend using obs for the recording however you need custom firmware to use ntr but just yesterday a huge step forward was taken in custom firmware and it can now be installed on any console pretty easily just follow
pokemon,removed,threesome
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,rshitpost
pokemon,removed,everything after the second row is totally unfamiliar to me
pokemon,removed,why was this removed ikeep posts highquality it is high quality i took a lot of time seeking the easter eggs in the video its not a oneliner jokes in text posts its not easilygooglable its not a question and its interesting content and original no one else has posted this keep questions here its not a question no shinies go here its not a shiny no memes go here its not a meme no screenshots it is a screenshot of the video not of the game but how else am i going to illustrate the easter egg on the video no cardscartridges its neither no clickbait not clickbait no lets playtop vids its not a lets play or top keep sm speculation in megathread and its not speculation its a fact of a machoke express co easter egg in the video of the japanese sun and moon trailer sorry its not a drawing of the starters this subreddit should just be called pokemonart because mods are making it impossible to post anything
pokemon,removed,sm feels more like gen than for me tbh no no no no no damn vp went over this a million times since the announcement of sm and the anons there went crazy in the discussion threads after today that theory had been finally put to rest there we are not going to start that shit here got it half generations have never been a thing and its a dumb idea to start with them now this is a new region with new pokémon and new characters this is generation deal with it and dont give me that bullshit but its on the same handheld and same engine excuse were also on the same handheld and engine as dppthggs
pokemon,removed,so i reply to you laughing and just saying that i dont care anymore enjoy the games a legitimate sendoff here and you who doesnt know me and the first person to ever talk to me like that decide to reply with that you dont know what goes on in my life you have no idea of anything about me except for a some stupid argument about foxes and dogs on a reddit thread i said some stupid things but im not the only guilty party i admit i got too hostile when some people started subtly insulting my intelligence and it got out of hand but what an utterly selfrighteous attitude this is the kind of shit im talking about you have absolutely no business coming in here and telling me to go better myself you dont even know me
pokemon,removed,oh go away
pokemon,removed,this isnt about sun and moon wrong sub
pokemon,removed,the circus walrus looks retarded you cant downvote me reddit rules say downvoting is only for irrelevancy this is relevant
pokemon,removed,call it sumo pokémon sm sounds so weird but yeah i agree gen rivals didnt feel like rivals when i beat blue or even wally it felt like an accomplishment serena was just like oh guess you win i hope the rivals are harder to beat in general too i was steamrolling my rival by midgame

pokemon,removed,obligatory rule mention
pokemon,removed,but since every team pretty much required to have one mega it always meant that one pokemon in everyones team had to be picked from a small collection of pokemon what is this supposed to mean outside of competitive in the actual game i see no requirement to have a mega on your team especially considering how easy xy and oras are and the fact whether it matters is a whole different discussion
pokemon,removed,fuck off
pokemon,removed,lol

pokemon,removed,aww you deleted your previous comment because someone pointed out that you said something stupid what a cop out
pokemon,removed,people were downvoting you because you were wrong if nintendo were to start asking artists for permission to use fanmade pokemon im sure many would jump at the opportunity in order to have their work immortalised in a pokemon game

pokemon,removed,mate all my legends be in premier balls damn son

pokemon,removed,modsnazis
pokemon,removed,also mods ive tried to post this but had them removed due to rule repost but i took this picture last night and after using the search this subreddit feature i havent been able to find any discussion mention of this i made sure to obey the rules by submitting it as a text post and i surely directly relates to pokémon
pokemon,removed,tagging you as triggered by hashtags
pokemon,removed,it feels like they decided to make them gangsta and only looked at pictures of white kids trying to be tough
pokemon,removed,look at the title of the video and deduce it or if you have relevant videos enabled youd know

pokemon,removed,tumblr please leave reddit is bad enough on its own already
pokemon,removed,id like to know of a place where you can discuss the anime without getting removed by the mods
pokemon,removed,good advice and ironic its coming from the person responsible for the gen and shit games
pokemon,removed,realized what
pokemon,removed,were about three comments away from yet another subredditdrama thread about an alakazam consent argument
pokemon,removed,are you fucking stupid i want them to put their free time into creating games that they can earn money from
pokemon,removed,fucking really mods you remove it for a spoiler in the title and then you remove the text that wasnt breaking rules and not the title that breaks the rules
pokemon,removed,wow this is one of the most upvotebait go posts ive seen in the past few days you dont even battle wild pokémon in go get out of here with your upvotebait
pokemon,removed,didnt mean to single you out wild dork you seem a little shady but ill let it slide i am not an incredibly active reddit poster my intent was to shout out to any niantec folks who might be watching that feeds here my feeling is that they are going to need to respond to some badly placed locations by moving or removing them already contacted niantec letting others know about it until they fix it
pokemon,removed,uh wild dork i was being sarcastic sorry about the abuse you and your family experienced
pokemon,removed,screamo rock band team rocket this is nuts
pokemon,removed,lol the entire front page of this sub is shitposts but mine gets deleted
pokemon,removed,outside your own town maybe not if your local transit system isnt up to scratch but theres no excuse for the people i see driving into my town just trolling through at in their cars i can accept the need to drive to your destination but when you get there get out of the car and actually walk around i have the same complaint with ingress players who do the same the whole point of this game is to get out on foot and see the world yet youre stuck in your car powergamers ruin everything
pokemon,removed,team valor
pokemon,removed,team mystic
pokemon,removed,team instinct
pokemon,removed,most of your front page is screenshots of pokemon go i had to go find that pokewalker under years of crap in a closet take a picture and make a shit meme taking more time than half the front page content most of your sub falls under rule right now why not delete everything and tell them to go to r pokemon go i never saw this rule change and it seems like its working for shit right now so go fuck yourself
pokemon,removed,whats a pun
pokemon,removed,bug spray does not repel pokémon in pokémon go so no

pokemon,removed,dont care enough to get go nor am i too keen on the original circle jerk
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,nice shit post
pokemon,removed,are you so ignorant and obstinate that you would use not having high capacity sd cards as an excuse are you even remotely familiar with remedial technology an sd card with gigabytes can be bought for around ten dollars or less buying pokemon on it would be simple and succinct these cards are not rare or in limited supply you can find them all over the internet and virtually buying a game holds a smorgasbord of advantages normally unobtainable when you physically buy a game through cartridges when you physically buy a game you have to go through the laborious and arduous task of finding a store that has the hardware driving or finding another mode of transportation to get there go through dozens of benign but ultimately banal social interactions and then finally buy the game conversely when you virtually buy a game you log onto the eshop and purchase it just like that you then immediately play the game without any cumbersome and intricate steps do you want to know another good thing about this process there is absolutely no chance of losing the game or the file getting corrupted unlike physical copies virtual titles cannot be dropped and broken scratched or unusable everything is safe and secure—right there on the is this too hard for you are you afraid to ask your mother for her credit card whats that i hear you want to sell or give away some of your games funny judging by your antisocial and pejorative personality that has a tendency to lash out at any sign of disagreement it is easily apparent that the number of friends at your disposable is close or directly at zero i surmise the only person who would willingly accept a game from you would be a deluded nomad wandering aimlessly who would immediately sell the game for beer and drugs i guess thats what you meant by give away switch to virtual buying or stop whining about your inferior gaming experience goodbye
pokemon,removed,why are you referencing that fictitious and oppressive deity i was having a logical secular dialectic here and you thought to sully it with the obscene appeal to that silly person would you care to go on and say something to the man or was that an irrational outburst of being galvanized and facile eloquence and ironclad logic
pokemon,removed,the socalled debate between cartridges and virtual games is not a debate at all we can easily objectively test and prove that buying a game virtually rather than physically is better personal preference includes things like favorite shoes this however has nothing to do with the vacuous task for inferiorminded humans that is shoeshopping and instead progresses into a science are you too ignorant to see that
pokemon,removed,cant unfortunately all demotransferred ashgreninjas are hardy
pokemon,removed,

pokemon,removed,sure ur mom
pokemon,removed,bullshit

pokemon,removed,thanks for marking it nsfw at least some of the mobile people will be safe also youre an incredible artist
pokemon,removed,i wish spoiler tags covered the image
pokemon,removed,why in fucks name do you post this thanks for spoiling the game why do you bother putting a spoiler tag on this when the title already spoils everything
pokemon,removed,huge spoilers
pokemon,removed,when reddit doesnt blur out or censor spoiler posts and youre pretty sure you just learned how the game ends
pokemon,removed,i thought were also was another bot that always quotes the quote bot but dont quote me on that though ureksaionly
pokemon,removed,yeah there shouldnt be spoilers in the title for at least a few months
pokemon,removed,wow i just spoiled big time and its not even my fault this is on rall theres no spoiler tag either
pokemon,removed,thank you spoiler
pokemon,removed,im crying fuck you
pokemon,removed,actually only post there please
pokemon,removed,its our fault for not beating it immediately after getting it for xmas but im glad people made that decision for us thanks mods thanks op
pokemon,removed,what the fuck woulda been nice not to have gotten a spoiler title in rall thanks
pokemon,removed,are they about to fuck
pokemon,removed,by nsfw i thought you meant rape haha
pokemon,removed,i literally just started playing im gutted this is an absolute joke just gonna filter rpokemon since the mods are clearly incapable
pokemon,removed,i wasnt rude before but now i am i hope people like you get hit by a bus
pokemon,removed,spoilers
pokemon,removed,i do kinda wish that if they do a game maybe based in kanto that if they have lillie be the champion she would have her lunalasolagleo as her final pokemon nicknamed nebby maybe they could do a deal where the main character gives him back its just sad to see them be separate
pokemon,removed,lets just say this isnt how i planned to spend my january morning also im salty because people pm the mods spoilers to various nonpokemon related stuff all the time we just got spoiled for rogue one in a modmail
pokemon,removed,unsubbed as well its literally less than week since christmas and this is spoiling the story
pokemon,removed,i thought were also was another bot that always quotes the quote bot but dont quote me on that though ureksaionly udonkeyofmiracles
pokemon,removed,dont quote me udonkeyofmiracles
pokemon,removed,ooh ooh i wanna try dont quote me utensolia
pokemon,removed,dem niggas gay for each other the graph clearly states
pokemon,removed,hey thanks op for spoiling the game right in the title top notch bullshit
pokemon,removed,dont quote me but you should really quote me uiamtotallynotsatan
pokemon,removed,wew lad how does it feel to sperg out
pokemon,removed,well stop its getting annoying tbh
pokemon,removed,nothing ever says it is the code clearly states that its a legendary bulbapedia does not refer to it as one fan site try harder next time pls
pokemon,removed,delet this
pokemon,removed,tfw tumblr artists will never be rounded up and shot
pokemon,removed,code made by develepors is not proof just live you life in delusion if you want to
pokemon,removed,how do you manage to survive in the real world when this is the level of tantrum you throw when a community of over half a million people cater to the needs of that community and not to your personal wants
pokemon,removed,idiot
pokemon,removed,i now have a spare lunala might just release it lol
pokemon,removed,or maybe the anime sucks just a thought
pokemon,removed,happy new year lol
pokemon,removed,you wanna trade me a necrozma ill trade it straight back lol
pokemon,removed,wonder how many times i can pull this off anyone wanna do some trade backs looking to fill my dex lol
pokemon,removed,youre
pokemon,removed,proud of yourself fuck over some kid and brag your a real piece of shit good luck amounting to anything you poor piece of shit
pokemon,removed,i have codes to trade pm me if interested
pokemon,removed,can you send me one possibly
pokemon,removed,well we can basically fix that issue by resetting their level when you transfer pokemon over from one game to the next their level becomes of what it was in previous game so a pokemon at lvl would be lvl and fire eblem does have a somewhat fighting system now when units meet for combat final fantasy like in has a fighting system now where you move around and attack like in pokken and uses a level system so again incorporating a level system into a fighting game isnt a big issue
pokemon,removed,are you joking or years old
pokemon,removed,please dont nominate yourself or your own content
pokemon,removed,id love to trade a mew code for a darkrai code have one mew code left over
pokemon,removed,imagine being so boring you think this is funny
pokemon,removed,if the rumored fireground for litten is true then the yellow makes perfect sense the yellow rock which i presume is sulphur indicates the ground typing
pokemon,removed,can i have one please if any are left
pokemon,removed,if you have any left can i have one
pokemon,removed,thats all too true however my arguement against it is again fairly graspy should the main antagonist team be messing with the earth cliché yes but plausible along with the sun moon zygarde would in fact be there i highly doubt that the new formes will strictly be anime only since my theory holds onto the idealogy that past principles arent changed but again its just a theory and you need to grasp for a theory to make any shred of sense if i just provided my opinion i would be called an idiot and whatever
pokemon,removed,i know i was bannedand later unbanned from here before but there was legitimately nothing wrong with what i sent them unless they just saw it was me so they didnt even read what i said
pokemon,removed,now they deleted this post i cant message themi cant post about ittheyve just banned me from pms for no reason and then banned me from any retalation
pokemon,removed,mah nigguh
pokemon,removed,i hope i am not too late i have eu codes and i would like to exchange them for na codes my game is na pm me if you are interested

pokemon,removed,fuck you steven stop showin evryone my fuckin deviantart you peace of shit
pokemon,removed,hell yeah im with you ive told people on youtube to boycott too and could you please spread the word freinds
pokemon,removed,hey the people who responded to my boycott posts on youtube were all in agreement
pokemon,removed,please if you have any codes left they arent any gamestops in my country and i want an arceus so bad
pokemon,removed,are you out of your mind you stupid man
pokemon,removed,dont forget to read the rules u can use any paint tool to post ur ideas here
pokemon,removed,disclaimer alert this comment is excessively long and runon sentences bare with me on the rant and yes i know it is a show but this is the only excuse i get to rant about shit anyways xd also i originally posted this onto a facebook group so yeah i apologize in advance if i am violating this subreddits rules by being rude which i am not by the way it is how i rant which might seem rude to some and for spamming which i am not going to spam in fact i will only be commenting this short stick into the threads that explicitly involve talking or ranting about ashs lose anyways i went on a tweet rant blasting pokemon and nintendo about ash losing to alain i legit just ranted to my friend accidentally scaring them off about the ash ordeal i would tell yall what i ranted about but i dont want to get kicked from the groupsubreddit for my rant but i will list what i mention note i did not mention all of this in fact i only did tweets so about of these and the rest i added when i started having a discussion with other members of this pokemon facebook group i was in so yeah i mentioned that alain did not even want to win the pokemon league ash lost to cameron who though full battles were on even with the pokemon ash still lost ash lost to tobias the hackeraction reply cheater with legendaries in the league latios and darkrai and who knows what the other were i betcha he got his arse whooped by cynthia orange league doesnt count brave frontier is insignificant because he turned down the offer plus even if he was a frontier brain he would lose anyways and brandon would just be the pyramid king because ash doesnt evolve a lot of his pokemon anyways i ranted about where is ashs father lol i even dare to rant about why ash is still i know nintendo game freak and pokemon like him at but it is just weird and i will explain why ash and gary are ten initially and still ten now because if ash is ten then gary is ten unless that is not how shit works in hoenn may turns ten and ash is still ten like dafug which is after johto and orange league in diamond pearl after the battle frontier saga dawn turns ten which at this point you would think ash would age nope youre wrong he is still ten paul is prolly too just kidding he is not since he has other badges before sinnoh oh and when may visits for that one contest i think for the wallace cup probably she is still ten in unova trip turns and ash is still or it is implied he is which is sad oh and dawn visits too at some point probably too and then in kalos we can only assume serena is because she started her journey unless she is or or i understand nintendo doesnt want him to be old but they are creating messed up time warps they should at least have him in kanto in hoenn in sinnoh or unova or kalos like bruh or even when he is in kalos i mean he still a kid at but then again this is based in japan age of consent is but there is other stuff to shut down pedophilia and age of marriage is like for women and for men with parental consent age of majority is even though the pokemon world itself doesnt conform to age laws but still also getting back on topic he had fully evolved pokemon this time around excluding pikachu and still lost nintendo destroying logic also they should not had limited the moves to to conform with the games because the anime is unique also pikachu lost volt tackle its signature move they should bring back volt tackle also greninja knows cut of all the moves he learns he knows cut he should of had ice beam or some beast ice type moves because most water types can learn ice type moves anyways i know it is a show but i just wanted to rant about pokemon haha xd edit yeah unova was as bad as sinnoh except without the tobias and legendary but still cameron only used pokemon and yet he won against ash then again at the time ash had a bunch of unevolved unova pokemon sorta yeah unfezant was fully evolved oshawott and snivy never evolved at all or given a chance in that matter tepig only evolved into pignite roggenrola evolved to boldore but not into gigalith and then there was pikachu he had leavanny but never used it a palpitoad that never evolved into seismitoad and hell he even krookodile but never used it again cameron he also had a scraggy which i am glad he didnt use against cameron but its not fully evolved and well yeah its a scraggy haha not to mention it was only riolu against of ashs pokemon left snivy pikachu unfezant because cameron though it was a on and you would think ash would win nope his riolu evolves during the battle that is not fair by that logic snivy should had evolved during the battle too or learned a new move and then it wipes out pikachu like bruhhhh edit again there are other pokemon that he should been offered a chance to evolve if they had wanted to like buizel considering aipom evolved into ambipom under the care of dawn into floatzel under the care of ash and there is gible it should had evolved into gabite and then into garchomp but it was too late by that time or at least evolved during the league conference battles corphish should had evolved while he was gone into a crawdaunt even though it was never seen if he has used corphish during the sinnoh league totodile bayleef and cyndaquil should had fully evolved while he was gone since they were already evolved except totodile but still croconaw would had been great unless they preserving totodile cuteness but then that points back to bayleef still trying to act cute and babyish xd update i somehow triggered the math bot honestly i totally forgot to mention tysons meowth during the hoenn league honestly with the pikachu defeating a metagross the same way it owned drakes dragonite thank you for mentioning it also i thought ash lost to richies pikachu because of charizards disobedience not to a bellsprout am i missing something here hmmmm
pokemon,removed,disclaimer alert this comment is excessively long and runon sentences bare with me on the rant and yes i know it is a show but this is the only excuse i get to rant about shit anyways xd also i originally posted this onto a facebook group so yeah i apologize in advance if i am violating this subreddits rules by being rude which i am not by the way it is how i rant which might seem rude to some and for spamming which i am not going to spam infact i will only be commenting this short stick into the threads that explicitly involve talking or ranting about ashs lose anyways i went on a tweet rant blasting pokemon and nintendo about ash losing to alain i legit just ranted to my friend accidentally scaring them off about the ash ordeal i would tell yall what i ranted about but i dont want to get kicked from the groupsubreddit for my rant but i will list what i mention note i did not mention all of this in fact i only did tweets so about of these and the rest i added when i started having a discussion with other members of this pokemon facebook group i was in so yeah i mentioned that alain did not even want to win the pokemon league ash lost to cameron who though full battles were on even with the pokemon ash still lost ash lost to tobias the hackeraction reply cheater with legendaries in the league latios and darkrai and who knows what the other were i betcha he got his arse whooped by cynthia orange league doesnt count brave frontier is insignificant because he turned down the offer plus even if he was a frontier brain he would lose anyways and brandon would just be the pyramid king because ash doesnt evolve a lot of his pokemon anyways i ranted about where is ashs father lol i even dare to rant about why ash is still i know nintendo game freak and pokemon like him at but it is just weird and i will explain why ash and gary are ten initially and still ten now because if ash is ten then gary is ten unless that is not how shit works in hoenn may turns ten and ash is still ten like dafug which is after johto and orange league in diamond pearl after the battle frontier saga dawn turns ten which at this point you would think ash would age nope youre wrong he is still ten paul is prolly too just kidding he is not since he has other badges before sinnoh oh and when may visits for that one contest i think for the wallace cup probably she is still ten in unova trip turns and ash is still or it is implied he is which is sad oh and dawn visits too at some point probably too and then in kalos we can only assume serena is because she started her journey unless she is or or i understand nintendo doesnt want him to be old but they are creating messed up time warps they should at least have him in kanto in hoenn in sinnoh or unova or kalos like bruh or even when he is in kalos i mean he still a kid at but then again this is based in japan age of consent is but there is other stuff to shut down pedophilia and age of marriage is like for women and for men with parental consent age of majority is even though the pokemon world itself doesnt conform to age laws but still also getting back on topic he had fully evolved pokemon this time around excluding pikachu and still lost nintendo destroying logic also they should not had limited the moves to to conform with the games because the anime is unique also pikachu lost volt tackle its signature move they should bring back volt tackle also greninja knows cut of all the moves he learns he knows cut he should of had ice beam or some beast ice type moves because most water types can learn ice type moves anyways i know it is a show but i just wanted to rant about pokemon haha xd edit yeah unova was as bad as sinnoh except without the tobias and legendary but still cameron only used pokemon and yet he won against ash then again at the time ash had a bunch of unevolved unova pokemon sorta yeah unfezant was fully evolved oshawott and snivy never evolved at all or given a chance in that matter tepig only evolved into pignite roggenrola evolved to boldore but not into gigalith and then there was pikachu he had leavanny but never used it a palpitoad that never evolved into seismitoad and hell he even krookodile but never used it again cameron he also had a scraggy which i am glad he didnt use against cameron but its not fully evolved and well yeah its a scraggy

pokemon,removed,as a christian i definitely dont get offended when characters are in crucifixionlike positions such as zoro on the parade ground in one piece in fact it was more annoying when they removed it in the dub but it could also be a oh man we cant show a kid getting hurt like this mindset perhaps who knows im fine with certain things being subtle and toned down ex criminal minds got increasingly grisly as it went just for shock factor but censorship just tends to cut out the dumbest things the impact here compared to the original just isnt the same

pokemon,removed,i always wondered why verlisify has this weird vendetta against hacks in pokemon its like this purist mentality for vgc yeah dont hack there but who gives a shit if you just want to make a team without the hassle of getting all the egg moves or what not ev training is boring id much rather have it be over with by using powersaves or something

pokemon,removed,they seem to differ in black and white the characters were actually and that was quite the jump
pokemon,removed,im pretty sure they would not explore it more so if your gay you are just gonna have crushes on guys and its not gonna change with age how you see it and handle it will for sure differ but as a kid you will not even know what you are feeling most likely then also keep in mind this is a pokemon game with a abusive parent as a main theme even if they characters are some are written to be over that age mentality for sure

pokemon,removed,i was all about this post until you started being passive aggressive about hacked pokémon
pokemon,removed,nice straw man see my previous post as i mention why i play the game and the fact that i dont even gen i breed ive been on battle spot there simply isnt enough time to do this for a lot of people id also argue that the intended features of the game are the collecting trading and battling features those are the ones i enjoy the most and the only ones present since day of the series ill stick to the series ive been playing for most of my life thanks i wont respond further as you obviously have your opinion and i dont think im going to change it but i think you need to realise that people who disagree with you arent awful people who automatically hate the programmers

pokemon,removed,then he needs to get out of the business taking criticism well isnt easy for a lot of people taking harsh senseless anger which the net has in spades is even tougher you have to have thick skin and a good sense of willmorality to keep your morale up soon as you give in though youve lost and unless you can recover youre only going to make more and more enemies admittedly there are many people out there who make a living out of being detestable but its not a circumstance i would suggest
pokemon,removed,meh everyone needs to unwad their panties verlisify is just fine
pokemon,removed,its not like hes wrong
pokemon,removed,to put it simply he talks out of his ass he does not know anything about competitive pokemon battling despite being a competetive poketuber
pokemon,removed,not not first time ive been accused of it its fine people are too damn happy all the time i admit i think everyone should be taken down a peg
pokemon,removed,this is from someone who respectfully watches verlisify however is aware of his hate one of the big reasons behind his hate is his attitude he likes to dis and criticize alot of poketubers and most of the criticism doesnt make since sometimes he states a right point like yes cheating is bad yes its wrong to clickbait for views smogon is shit and some poketubers need to place leak warnings and what did with the false info stream was wrong but where he is wrong is how he thinks hes better than anyone saying yeah i got more views than you more subscribers other moments where he says several poketubers are desperate and hungry for views where he himself stirs up rants and these videos are monetized its this attitude that makes him sink lower than and he stole money and caused a fight with tyranitartube verlis leads alot of bullying on other poketubers as well but heres where i like him when hes not ranting and making an ass of himself is where he is actually good i love his fanfridays showing off various battles and strategies i like his how to videos they are useful i like his speculation videos they are the most realistic opinions where some peoples theories go off the deep end to crazy the biggest thing is he doesnt discuss leaks because of the time leaks are fake which is something i like about him more than tyranitartube who plain out treat all leaks like they are real with no caution so that leaves my final opinion i like his normal pokemon content but his bad attitude needs to go or he will continued to be hated and disliked
pokemon,removed,dont want to say anything mean here but if you want to stop seeing videos from a certain channel on youtube there are buttons to do that
pokemon,removed,dont like an artists rendition fine look up the design changes with pikachu through the years and tell me things havent been simplified

pokemon,removed,to be fair im not a fan of casuals either casuals tend to believe theyre more knowledgeable then they actually are and trivialize things but youre right about everything else vers is terrible to his fans and starts drama too often
pokemon,removed,hes such a fucking crybaby
pokemon,removed,no its gotta be the canadian survivor ripoff they call total drama and they gotta send shit to another dimension ocean dub of dbz
pokemon,removed,whats verlisifys fursona
pokemon,removed,the point is someone is proud of it and you feel its okay to just shit on it because it doesnt live up to your standards on the other hand he could have used a quickball and a blaster then had to explain both of the tattoo to everyone seriously the most annoying question to ask anyone with a tattoo is what does it mean like i had to have some sort a deep meaningful reason for x to be here furthermore i also wish to recant it to you a fucking stranger sometimes the most recognizable symbols can cut out a lot of the dumb ass questions unfortunately you get the opposite effect because then your tattoo isnt enough for some motherfucker on reddit piss right the fuck off you goddamn monkey

pokemon,removed,i can guarantee almost immediately that the creator most likely did not host this file himself because whoever is hosting did something that the creator wouldnt do the file has a rom in it the creator like many rom hackers never provide people with the rom they provide a patch and never the rom if this is hosted by the creator and did give you the permission you could easily provide proof of this in the form of a screenshot of said permission given now what now i continue to doubt the validity of your claims because youve provided no evidence as to why i shouldnt i know the creator doesnt mind people distributing the patch but he definitely wouldnt distribute the rom himself

pokemon,removed,the op is not a drag queen he isnt performing drag
pokemon,removed,i understand its uncomfortable to be called out but responding that way just shows you really only care about your own perceived innocence not about marginalized people what you just said is what every celebrity says when they get called out for for example racism my friend is black and said that comment i made was okay so you cant call it racist it doesnt work that way different individual people have different opinions theres black people who feel there is no real racism in america that doesnt make it true nor does their being black make that statement carry more weight just because one of those people were okay with what you did doesnt make it okay or mean that the thing itself isnt harmful if you genuinely care about marginalized people instead of using them to defend yourself when called on a shitty behavior youll reexamine whether your behavior was acceptable btw owning a lesbian bar has nothing to do with trans people lgbt people arent an interchangable monolith
pokemon,removed,yes it looks ridiculous because the outfit is designed for someone slim and shaven and hes outofshape and has unkempt body hair his implication was that men wearing womens clothing is inherently preposterous which is objectionable

pokemon,removed,a penis plural penises or penes niːz is the primary sexual organ that male and hermaphrodite animals use to inseminate sexually receptive mates usually females and hermaphrodites respectively during copulation such organs occur in many animals both vertebrate and invertebrate but males do not bear a penis in every animal species and in those species in which the male does bear a socalled penis the penes in the various species are not necessarily homologous for example the penis of a mammal is at most analogous to the penis of a male insect or barnacle

pokemon,removed,do you not think that its possible that these were scrapped much earlier than now also i edited the post with what really is bothering me with people using it as fact in addition i dont have to shut up this is the internet im entitled to say what i want and i wasnt saying that they would change them anyway my big concern with this whole thing is that people use it as if it were an official release from nintendo now while i dont care about saying something like if the leak is true then but saying well because the leaks are true is what bothers me it encourages the wrong behavior in a community of people who are pretty spoiled with events information games and overall things for them to obsess over all the time this sort of leaking in my opinion is wrong it encourages people to not be professional in their jobs it encourages people to hack computers or databases just for that little bit of info it says that its alright to break the rules termsconditions or the law just for you to get a few minutes of fame and credibility on the internet thats my biggest issue with this after responding to everyone telling me exactly how wrong i am now if youd like to have a discussion id be more than happy but if youre just going to yell at me to shut up or tell me im stupiddumbwhatever well please just dont bother replying

pokemon,removed,wow you really went in
pokemon,removed,i think you have too much time on your hands if you thought that this was the best response to what was said you could have ignored but instead you went in to what they liked instead and i completely lost track of what your intentions were at that point
pokemon,removed,one question why i dont see the point in that or any other as a response being worthwhile unless it is in response to another and for those that dont know that it is a copypasta like me were gonna take it seriously and think that there is a huge jump in logic
pokemon,removed,you dont sound like a fun person
pokemon,removed,yup i do theyre on here
pokemon,removed,the fuck just happened
pokemon,removed,congrats mods will probabaly remove the image though had mine removed as low effort
pokemon,removed,it gets deleted instantly automatically its not a mod doing it also its not a question its a guide of about characters

pokemon,removed,this looks like itll last
pokemon,removed,hopefully pokemon eclipse on the switch will answer all questions about this manwomanpokemonattack helicopter
pokemon,removed,there is a good bit more information in the video sorry i wasnt worth a few minutes of your time friend
pokemon,removed,how about you do your job to earn a paycheque and then play when you get home
pokemon,removed,great comment thats the exact same thing you must be an expert to chain lunala to be seriously though plenty of people do just that which has even lesser odds of being perfect protip lunala is a special attacker so you should sr with a modest synchronizer for as close to unless youre trying for a specific hidden power i apologize that this guide seems to challenge your comprehension i believe that you can understand it though if you read it a bit slower then you can use a better example if you have a legitimate criticism im welcome to hear it otherwise youre adding nothing to the discussion
pokemon,removed,yeah thats the last time you ever leave things in the open for your little brother to use sorry for your loss i cant imagine how devastated id be even if its just a game or its just pokemon its still eight years of your work that has just been casually erased dont let that little fuckwit touch your shit ever again ever
pokemon,removed,fuck off
pokemon,removed,probably the guy from earlier i tried posting a vid of his and asking is he on to something or is he on something because at the time id only seen the this guy has pokemon with perfect evivs hes unlikely to have i bet theyre hacked vid and not the holy wow guys hes bragging about hacking and he used a hacktool in the tourney taking pics for proof vid
pokemon,removed,yes
pokemon,removed,cool thanks i opened a support ticket reporting it
pokemon,removed,no fuck you fake me
pokemon,removed,oh i was expecting something akin to rblackfathers
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,penis
pokemon,removed,is it padded or are you actually just fat
pokemon,removed,nurse joy is way thinner
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,does not have bags under her eyes and while does not look enthused does not look like hates life is no true nurse
pokemon,removed,you gotta wiggle it around
pokemon,removed,i thought she was cosplaying blissey
pokemon,removed,no one is gonna mention her weight shes kinda too fat to be nurse joy if you guys have actually seen the anime or read the manga you would know that nurse joy is skinny pretty sure this is chanseys cosplay
pokemon,removed,nurse joy wasnt fat
pokemon,removed,did you read rule
pokemon,removed,thick like one ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
pokemon,removed,hi rule is our rule against rudeness please read it in the sidebar httpswwwredditcomrpokemonwikibannedsubmissions
pokemon,removed,totally mediocre really surprised it has so many upvotes
pokemon,removed,lol fatty
pokemon,removed,ironically the fact that this reminder is the first thing i saw upon opening the thread draws attention to potentially negative commentary and immediately makes many people look for the bad rather than enjoy the good well done ol chap s
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,fat
pokemon,removed,im just glad youre not a dude
pokemon,removed,nice nips
pokemon,removed,i plus size cosplay
pokemon,removed,i dont remember nurse joy being overweight unless im wrong
pokemon,removed,httpkevanorgbraincgispamzat
pokemon,removed,i thought it was a chansey cosplay
pokemon,removed,not really a fan of this cosplay tbh
pokemon,removed,and thats what he said
pokemon,removed,lol
pokemon,removed,lose some weight fatty
pokemon,removed,is this a snorlax cosplay
pokemon,removed,nurse joy gained a few pounds
pokemon,removed,the fuck is with this comment thread the most upvoted and downvoted comments are so similar who the fuck brigaded this
pokemon,removed,nurse joy cosplaying snorlax fixed that for ya
pokemon,removed,how did i know there was going to be shaming the moment i saw this pic i hate this site sometimes
pokemon,removed,looks bad tbh
pokemon,removed,is it because theyre overweight or what
pokemon,removed,step wear all white with a white apron step eat cheeseburgers per day for months step put on nurse hat
pokemon,removed,guess nurse joy has been chowing down on those pokeblocks
pokemon,removed,httpwwwabsoluteanimecompokemonjoyjpg
pokemon,removed,how did this extremely mediocre cosplay end up on the front page
pokemon,removed,i recall joy being smaller and the wig is completely wrong
pokemon,removed,looks more like chancey
pokemon,removed,shut the fuck up with that loser shit
pokemon,removed,if u get anymore send me one pls babe
pokemon,removed,more like snorlax
pokemon,removed,i dont remember nurse joy being so damn overweight id still let her gobble on my pokeballs though
pokemon,removed,i thought nurse joy was skinny tho
pokemon,removed,didnt realize how fat nurse joy is
pokemon,removed,just because they have shiny legendaries that are locked doesnt mean that they are cheaters i have a bunch of legends that ive traded for that might not be legit but does that make me a cheater no not going to give up a pokemon just because it might have came into the games through different means tldr imo if its traded for your not cheating
pokemon,removed,aside from shiny locked pokemon their is no way to tell if a pokemon is hacked or not as long as it is possible to get pokemon through normal play it is legal also if were talking rules you should know the downvote button is not a disagree button
pokemon,removed,bit big for nurse joy aint ya
pokemon,removed,looks like
pokemon,removed,likely as most trainers do i wouldnt have my first would be a gift from my parents probably and they would give me something resilient but not rare or pricey i would probably say a cacturn i live in texas anyways now for the second stage of my life i was interested in coding so since i cant say genesect my answer would be porygon my third pokemon would be chancy or blissey with my interest in medicine i travel a lot and with a large interest in trading and marketing it is likely that i could encounter one my fourth and final poke would be ninjask not an op team but it could hold its own

pokemon,removed,disclaimer this is an honest opinion not a troll post lillie is never really a friend shes a sex object shes the damsel who is constantly in distress shes the young pretty blond girl repeatedly in need of rescuing constantly grateful for your help rarely useful to have around and is for lack of a better phrase intentionally incompetent if the homeless drunk on the shore with three magikarp can be a trainer im pretty sure she could handle it shes like a vegan who needs to pay he rent in beef and is constantly begging help from her neighbor the butcher she goes out of her way to make herself prettier about of the way through the game for no apparent reason hau is infatuated with her the main character presumably is as well and if pokemon were made by hbo she and her brother would be having a lannister momenttm if the male main character had any sense hed be getting with the hot saucy olivia or the rugged competent hapu or any of the other dozens of npcs who strive to be their own best person without constantly making excuses for why they cant walk a few hundred yards without a stack of max repels

pokemon,removed,tbh from reading your responses to others comments it seems that you dont want to hear anything about people who dont mindcare about this being a thing so far a few people said what they had to and gave their reasoning for their opinion you in turn have tried to shut them down its fine if you dont like not having a national dex but dont try to shit on the opinions of others who are not in line with yours personally i like the idea of having the national dex tied to the bank it means i dont have to transfer my entire living dex and allows me to still have access to those pokemon on my games and if i need a specific mon for eg for egg moves ill just breed one specifically to transfer up to tldr dont ask for peoples opinion then get butthurt when its not the same as yours

pokemon,removed,they actually changed that rule last week it said a whole episode instead of lengthy clips i even sent the mods a pretty angry pm saying they should follow the current rules or change them looks like they changed them
pokemon,removed,op clearly didnt read the rules giveaway threads are against the rules
pokemon,removed,awesome no pikachu though i love pikachu check out this pokémon yellow version remix
pokemon,removed,the pokemon company and nintendo are still punishing european markets because some european stores released the xy games a week early blatantly untrue europe has always gotten the games later prior to gen we could usually expect to get the games months after the us it just takes longer to localise the game for multiple languages and european law mandates that games have to be released across europe at the same time they cant just give the uk the game first even though the english version is already ready if they were punishing them for leaks then delaying the game by a week wouldnt make much difference itll still leak and most of the xy info came a good month before the official date by canadian posters the broken street dates in europe just added to it but judging by the fact even the official nintendo store sent copies early i doubt they cared much that happens for literally every game

pokemon,removed,your argument can be simplified to i dont think expansion is related to gladion because i dont think they look similar enough which is purely subjective and could be used for any of the other ultra beasthuman combinations im pretty sure you are a troll so im going to report you
pokemon,removed,did you literally skip the whole first part of my previous comment at this point you are clearly trolling and i hope the moderators ban you

pokemon,removed,what is that if not a pokémon then
pokemon,removed,started playing pokemon x since the silvergold days would truly appreciate a code if possible thanks in advance
pokemon,removed,unzips dick dont deglove it
pokemon,removed,still prefer digimons though im not playing pokémon like before the first game was exceptional i will never forget some musics and moments in it too bad they gloriously failed the other games though i dont want to start any flame its just a taste probably pokémon is better considering its popularity but digimon tv series beats pokémon all days more story more feelings better fights more suspense better characters everything
pokemon,removed,players implying genwunners actually play the games and dont just complain about them
pokemon,removed,unzips dick my word
pokemon,removed,i dont get it

pokemon,removed,dicks out no excuses
pokemon,removed,unzips dick
pokemon,removed,i mean majority of pokemon after gen are pretty terrible i play the games for fun but not because i think the overall generation is good

pokemon,removed,thanks for getting my hopes up ass
pokemon,removed,search for lunumbras custom painted cards on facebook she twitch streams and sells the cards im fairly sure she does commission too

pokemon,removed,no screenshots rule
pokemon,removed,uh
pokemon,removed,this is incredibly amazing ive just made another reddit account to give you another upvote
pokemon,removed,screenshots are technically banned but for some reason this one is still up
pokemon,removed,nintendo likes to claim that they are not legal but they do have an obvious bias in that opinion i believe that the emulator itself can be legal but the rom must fall under a specific criteria and stay within it however that is only my understanding of the issue and can be biased as well
pokemon,removed,alright how do you get it on android if youre from the us
pokemon,removed,word has it that you can be banned for doing that not sure if it is true just saw it in another thread
pokemon,removed,is there a emulator online somewhere i really just want to play xy as the emulators only go up to black and white
pokemon,removed,sure if looking good means looking like a dumbass
pokemon,removed,been messing around with it all day

pokemon,removed,in fairness if youre an android user you can play right now wherever you are in the world its just ios users that are missing out right now
pokemon,removed,you should have read the rules
pokemon,removed,checking out of rpokemon and straight into rferalpokeporn
pokemon,removed,there are guids online you know how to get the app
pokemon,removed,yeah but at least with android you can just get the apk file and install it without the play store
pokemon,removed,oh no so mean
pokemon,removed,rdragonsfuckingcars
pokemon,removed,as of this edit there is no word on release for other regions anything you hear at this point is speculation as reports are that it will get your account banned haha really what a god damn contradiction this shit is working just fine in california
pokemon,removed,i got it thanks the servers are down delete your posts i think the mods are going full nazi on those who share

pokemon,removed,looks like passimian has his dick in the bounsweet
pokemon,removed,why would they need to is it also strange that they did not discuss double triple rotation battles
pokemon,removed,you cannot transfer pokémon to sun and moon at all without bank and you cannot trade between xyoras and sun or moon to answer your question you have to wait until january im sorry i cant make this any clearer but people have answered your question several times and youre still taking away the wrong answer

pokemon,removed,apparently its some kind of shitposting war between mods its still stupid though
pokemon,removed,mods have been taking down a lot of posts recently that they deem questions even if theyre discussions taking them down for not using the questions thread
pokemon,removed,no i just think the vocal minority have injected thrir oppinion more and to an annoying extent im not willfully blind and you asserting that like some expert on me is ridiculous you must be willfully stupid to like luchalitten see thats not a fair thing for me to say
pokemon,removed,also know as the progression of pokémon just looking like ridiculous messes
pokemon,removed,sorry idk if im in the right section but can anyone link me to an original emerald version rom i tried a few websites but they all tried to give me virusesspyware

pokemon,removed,because people have been putting lgbt people down for decades this is giving pride back to people who had their pride taken away from them
pokemon,removed,black pride is totally a thing too for the same reasons others have mentioned
pokemon,removed,ho oh looks literally retarded and since pride has zero to do with pokemon you can tell this person was just trying to get upvotes
pokemon,removed,this ruined hooh for me 😭😭😭😭
pokemon,removed,im sorry did i make you mad sorry i dont like the picture but ho oh doesnt look good and its pretty obvious that this person is just trying to get upvotes for posting something about pride when it doesnt seem to belong in pokemon a fictional game lol
pokemon,removed,bc it makes hooh look like a fag
pokemon,removed,proud of what gayness thats stupid you arent proud for being straight why be proud for being gay

pokemon,removed,no triggered memes unfunny
pokemon,removed,i honestly think it might go down as the worst generation in the franchise but thats just my opinion with all the unnecessary changes like no gyms or champions all their weird complicated unpronouncible names for their pokemon and the incredibly obnoxious hawaiian theme pasted onto everything you can imagine the pokemon centers iconic theme and likely pretty much every relevant city or town it just seems too different and separated from the rest of the series in a forced was imho theres also the fact that imo this gen has some of if not the most going mons by gen rather than mons overall ugly obnoxious and quite frankly terribly designed pokemon in the series half the alola forms mostly the ones they didnt show of course are total trash as well and since the ultra beasts look to be catchable potentially meaning a permanent part of the pokedex and pokemon history they only serve to be glorified overdesigned legendaries with odd names that simply belong in digimon rather than pokemon overall with the forced theme and features ugly pokemon designs and lack of mega evolutions to keep me interested sun and moon look to be the worst set of pokemon games ive ever seen the protagonists walks runs and emotes like a robot we cant sit anymore we can hardly interact with objects the battle hud looks odd with the fight option to the right and discourages lefthanders hawaiian theme is forced upon every part of the game weve seen and honestly feels a little obnoxious unova and kalos didnt shove new york and france down our throats the we say alola as hi thing is especially cringy and to me says they arent trying to mix the inspirations in with the world of pokemon but instead are just copypasting themes new features replace the old ones instead of being their own things staple features are missing mega evolutions the feature they practically forced on us for nearly years is abandoned in any way that is relevant in favor of gimmicky onetimeuse moves with kindergartenesque dances attached and forms of ignored pokemon that will only make that version even more ignored the game is too easy with the combination of the battle hud handing you type knowledge the warning of when a trainers about to see you and the hints of babying with the roto dex several pokemon look overdesigned while others look underdesigned this fanbase eats anything up so dont go expecting a pile of sand with a shovel in it to go criticized or a badly scribbled piece of cloth with a stick to exist without other claiming its adorable the ultra beasts dont look like pokemon and probably arent pokemon if i wanted to play a game called ultra beasts then id buy that but i bought pokemon those starters are all hideous with rowletts looking the least bad pooplios looking too feminine in a bad way unlike delphox and meganium where it was tasteful and not just a females face pasted on a mermaid body and incineroar looks like a hanna barbera knockoff character oh and yes being a wrestler is equally as bad as being a firefighting type its the same concept dont hide it again this is all just my own opinion but in that i believe with gen vii trying so hard to be different it might just end up being the most hated or controversial in pokemon history the features and gimmicks will all be forgotten about by the time the good recognizable staples are brought back for next gen this gen will imo probably be forgotten about and only occasionally remember as that odd generation a black sheep in the family but yeah i dont get the hype either i know this is more than you really wanted and you probably dont agree with most or all points but i needed to rant somewhere until the gen vii hate season gets here in a few years or so

pokemon,removed,did you ask the original artist for permission to pay someone else to copy their work and put it on your body or is art theft suddenly okay because its a tattoo no artist with any integrity would copy someone elses work its a shame because this actually looks really nice clearly the work they do is good and clearly youre happy with it but this was someones design that was original that they made and you essentially stole it didnt pay them or give them any credit and then payed someone else to copy it that happens so often here and its just wrong
pokemon,removed,i will tell you my favorite encore story i do this all the time in competitive matches picture this the opponent sends out a pretty strong and fast and bulky all around amazing pokemon you know he wants to set up with a sword dance so he can sweep your team so you send out your volbeat and he uses sword dance you use encore now from my own experience when im playing with competitive players players who know exactly what encore does of the time they never switch out idk why i guess they like to see their stats go up and they know volbeat is pretty weak so they stay in and use sword dance first turn i dont attack them i use tail glow second turn they still stay in and use another sword dance seeing their stats raise higher i also use tailglow they are thinking thanks bro for just letting me set up even though your volbeat is also boosting its special attack my pokemon is way stronger and now i have sword dance times i am at full power time to get sweeped then the beautiful twist and once again competitive players fall for this they forget to realize i can just encore them again boom now their using sword dance all over again and its useless now they finally realized they made a huge mistake and their trapped and should have switched from the very beginning they switch out now but unfortunatly i use baton pass and baton pass max special attack dmg to a fast special pokemon and because of their own pride i know have a monster that sweeps their entire team just because they let me encore tldr never take encore lightly lol
pokemon,removed,i will travel across the land searching far and wide these pokemon to understand the power thats inside
pokemon,removed,ha i knew this post would break the rules despite having actually read through all of the rules before posting

pokemon,removed,the best encoré users are memento whimsicott and mega lopunny as it stands up volbeat is just so freaking exploitable outside of weather control on its own tier that id rather use whimsicott or meowstic males as my prankster support options anywhere else the ground type being faster than a prankster user means there is no risk in double switching it can stay in indefinitely thanks to the wave immunity thats the downfall of volbeat prediction as t wave on the incoming pokemon can be wasted and now volbeat risks giving a free turn higher speed than volbeat means also that on a u turn scenario he can be destroyed a ground type is pretty much a checkmate to volbeat user momentum
pokemon,removed,your litreally over here scoffing at a pokemon which if has the opening can give you to special attack in one turn i mean once again with stealth rock in the beginning talonflame is down and any scarf users sigh bro your like the worst kind of trainer you patronize other trainers thinking only your strategy will always work out the best someone comes in telling people about a cool baton pass team your response oh that sucks what if the opponent has a team of unaware pokemon lol in your head you your team always have that exact pokemon and moves to contour any strategy huh any other person would be like cool i can give a special attack to one of my pokemon but your over here like no that wont work if there are no stealth rock and the opponent was holding a focus sash or if he was holding a choice scarf and if you werent or if the pokemon has the ability unaware and if you didnt give your to a powerful special pokemon that isnt bulky or had any good move and if your volbeat has twave then my pokemon has lum berry thus this whole strategy sucks thus my meowstic is better cause it possibly cant have any contours and now you better not make a pokemon team solely to contour him lol ive met many people like you and its my fault for even engaging have a wonderful day sit

pokemon,removed,this has a load of bullshit in it just like the real bible so thats a job well done
pokemon,removed,that doesnt make any sense because the entire concept of an orchid mantis is that its a fearsome predator disguised as a flower youre saying that lurantis is a fearsome predator disguised as a fearsome predator an orchid mantis has everything to gain by imitating a flower whereas a plant would gain nothing by imitating an insect based on its description it is obvious that lurantis has similar themes to the real life orchid mantis lurantis draws opponents near to itself with its flowerlike appearance it implies that it only appears to be a plant every indication of its actual biology points toward it being an insect
pokemon,removed,hes the sassy gay friend
pokemon,removed,rule seems to apply in this situation
pokemon,removed,not that im promoting or supporting this by any means in accordance with rule some people take it upon themselves to use gba or ds emulators on phones or computers to play them for free which is just terrible and illegal so dont do that
pokemon,removed,if youre not overloaded with requests in pms would you be willing to make a male espeon sucking off his trainer or just keep the espeons gender ambiguous wutface

pokemon,removed,ive put quite a bit of effort and thought into a postmeme before and it was quite good i agree with the first and second guy i dont think i agree with the mods deciding quality is accurate something tells me that the mods dont know dank memes

pokemon,removed,would it be possible to get a code
pokemon,removed,dont misgender her garchomp like that
pokemon,removed,i honestly dont think of any of the pokemon characters as japanese unless its someone like erika who wears a kimono i mean especially since nearly all of the characters dont even have japanese names anime doesnt always reflect japanese appearances the anime may take place in japan and the characters may even have japanese names but the appearances are very outofplace because the creators intention is to create very distinct characters with the multitude of hair colors facial features and whatnot
pokemon,removed,so basically theyre gay af got it love it lol
pokemon,removed,the mods have been very trigger happy with rule as of late
pokemon,removed,the lesson there is not to get ahead of yourself and dont let your expectations go too wild especially when theyre based upon nothing but a picture or a word basically theres no one to blame for your disappointment but you
pokemon,removed,huh
pokemon,removed,all pokemon and humans if you could just not misgender me thatd be clutch thanks

pokemon,removed,i sure hope their motives goes deeper than the hooliganism they present have you never had an issue riding a bike towards the camera and hitting a wall every few seconds because you cannot see it in time to react or walked into a trainer battle you could and would have liked to avoid but because the perspective made you unable to see the trainer until after you had triggered their battle

pokemon,removed,oh my arceus you guys should probably watch the videos on the original theory before making comments that make you look dumb in front of people who have actually watched them
pokemon,removed,sorry to hate but this is the worst theory since holy shit its the same person youre taking your theories from the same person who thought that the smash bros games are based on a furry autistic kid even matpat makes better theories than this guy holy shit anyway i got off track as i was saying this theory has no legs to stand on theres no logical pattern between generations and all of the coincidences occur either in the same generation or in the anime that generation being the one that had everything named after a color no shit its going to coincide with the colors of the rainbow

pokemon,removed,how does this work
pokemon,removed,is there anyway to just buy these off someone i mean someone must be making good bucks selling these on mass not that is in anyway legal but this here is like a million hungry kids under a piñata that trickles candy one by one
pokemon,removed,the dewcong are hiding in the trees
pokemon,removed,i never believe these magazine leaks of the time days later someone comes out and proves its fake
pokemon,removed,bullshit every single pokemon player says yeah fuck muk and grimer that shits just a pile of sludge just like they also hate garboder your friend is a troll
pokemon,removed,thats fucking stupid waste of a pokemon
pokemon,removed,sure ya do youre totally not just tryign to be a contrarian
pokemon,removed,the anime also has moves like sceach dealing damage the anime is bullshit
pokemon,removed,obviously not since you can go on google and find even leaked starters from them that are completely false
pokemon,removed,people also hate delphox when the fucking chespin like deserves the hate bulbasaur was the worst from gen and i dont even want to know what you think of gardevoir because i just ate
pokemon,removed,it doesnt seriously you morons dont even remember when they got incorrect typings for half of the gen pokes at first
pokemon,removed,right i havnt because i dont need to prove myself to kids
pokemon,removed,caugh in denial caugh
pokemon,removed,why theyre useless

pokemon,removed,lol gamestop
pokemon,removed,this was a really bad episode lmao no offense to any serena or amourfags but the entire episode felt completely rushed with tons of reused animation and completely shit on serenas character towards the end she had a year arc where she tried to find a goal in her life and then she just tosses her goal away in order to go to hoenn to partake in contests what the fuck
pokemon,removed,would you prefer it if i called them amourfans and serenafans i really do not mean any offense when i typed this considering im an amourfag myself
pokemon,removed,i used to believe the phrase if you act like a victim you will be treated like a victim but as ive grown up ive realised it is wrong and it alot closer to if you act like a victim you will start to believe that any little thing is victimising you there is nothing racist about this get over yourseld
pokemon,removed,geyyyy
pokemon,removed,i love gyarados but it doesnt make in my top popular pokemon p check this out
pokemon,removed,stop my penis can only get so erect
pokemon,removed,the op is an idiotdont bother arguing with em there several artificial mons that arent legendary and just because someone created something to battle legendaries doesnt mean its actually capable of such furthermore gladion doesnt have the only onehow the fuck would you capture it if that was the case
pokemon,removed,either its the jojofaghunters who refuse to let it into their franchise or people just wanted another friendly dragon i thought it was just fineeither way this guys going to be an offensive beast with hopefully an attack stat equal to darmanitan with some more defensive capabilities it already hits steel and ice hard if it has some decent speed which it looks like it does and hopefully itll get knock offpursuit though we should still see if he can nail fairy typeswhich pretty much destroy him
pokemon,removed,this post will probably be taken down so i advise you move this information there

pokemon,removed,oh god a paki weeb youll be downvoted to oblivion that japanese just wasnt necessary dude
pokemon,removed,yeah as if the greeks needed more of an excuse to do nothing and be useless
pokemon,removed,for starters complaining about downvotes is lame people have the right to vote period you do not get to ask them why they didnt vote but if i had to guess its because ptsd guy picked the lamest reason to get over it nobody is picking up litter if anything theyre making more obese people need a better reason to lose weight thats just sad autistic kids have always had fun and socialized why are you singling out these groups by implying they had no reason to live before pokemon go
pokemon,removed,i have froakies charmanders and pikachus but cant get my hands on a squirtle looking for an oshawott too if you had one the gts all want shaymins for them
pokemon,removed,seriously though greeks are lazy and disgusting calm it down with the cologne
pokemon,removed,i could tell you were greek i could smell you from here also thats not racist greeks arent a race theyre a plague
pokemon,removed,nothing to me but i sympathize with all the children your filthy people have anally assaulted over the centuries and also the sheep animals arent there to fuck man
pokemon,removed,a couple of years i go i played pokémon crystal on my pc via an emulator and it was awesome since the whole pokémon go hype ive wanted to replay the game but i cant find a valid download for the game does anyone know a safe download i already have the emulator visualboyadvance

pokemon,removed,originally i had made that post about the nintendo power magazine ad it is pokemon related i used a separate camera to take the photo since i cant hold my phone very still and i made sure it had adequate lighting it brings back nostalgia of the time of the gba i want to speak with those mods
pokemon,removed,in the lower right corner above the list of moderators should be a message the mods button
pokemon,removed,honestly i cant see any valid reason either either they have a bot that auto nuked this or they clearly have a mod that really should not being one

pokemon,removed,yeah this sub blows full of shitty art and people who dont even play competitively they just draw lame pictures of eeveeloutions so they can get upvotes
pokemon,removed,probably a long shot but if anyone has a spare mew code i would really appreciate it
pokemon,removed,feel you man i wish we had a low effort policy or less images on a post warrant a removal from this sub reddit all images need to give credit to the artist otherwise they get removed i dont know a policy to warrant quality would be the best thing to hit this place
pokemon,removed,imo xy has better animation but other than that dp is the superior series in every way in dp ash has a rival from the very start that is as experienced as him problem with sawyer is that he was basically never a threat to ash and alan came in too late when the series was almost over and also this rival doesnt have the generic nice guy personality thats another plus and then there is much more team galactic hunter j a female companion that actually battles and develops her pokemon so much better than serena who almost never uses her pokemon yeah i think many bias vote for xy because its the current series it really aint that special apart from the animation

pokemon,removed,first you want the universal randomizer dont have the link w me on mobile but just search that youll find it if youre adept at pokemon do a randomized soul link if not do regular as the game naturally increases the power of wild mons and trainers throughout the game i dont believe in the universal randomizer you can choose to leave gym leaders and alone but you can set to make them have equal powered mons not sure about rules of rival locke but on your first go id try soul link for a regular randomized game go into the randomizer select your rom then you want to change stuff like wild pokémon and trainers pokemon you can make trainers have equal strengthed mons like i said if i were you do not randomize types or move sets because thats for veterans of randomizers that want to literally go insane good luck tell me if you have any other questions

pokemon,removed,someone already loaded up the demo in an emulator and changed the dates so the event would trigger she ends up meeting a machamp rather than a person he didnt receive any reward for any of the events and none of them revealed any new info besides meeting lilly so theres probably something missing that forcing the events that way leaves out i have to imagine you get some transferable reward for coming back to them

pokemon,removed,go to it and read the sidebar dog there are a bunch of rules that describe how it works
pokemon,removed,im a boy
pokemon,removed,chats going so fast no one will ever know im a cork soaker
pokemon,removed,lmao wheres your source that they are alternative forms though i literally could care less if you believe me or not enough to source on information thats been talked about in discord and the sub all day long youll see in a dayweekmonth that they have a fucking dex number therefore arent forms and then youll hopefully feel dumb
pokemon,removed,the leaked starter evos are real but dont look up anything else save it to be surprised i wish i did 👀
pokemon,removed,the fact that the entire pokedex has been revealed before the game is even released pisses me off beyond belief one of my favourite things in these games where discovering the new pokemon whenever a new region comes round and seeing what they evolve into etc but no gamefreak in a pitiful attempt to hype the game releases them all at this point im contemplating not even buying it

pokemon,removed,someone is having a bad day i literally disagree with every one of your opinions pokemon is doing quite well at the moment if you didnt focus so much on what you dont like most of which being optional like using certain pokemon you may be more satisfied also i tried watching and playing yokai and i think it is absolutely terrible definitely dont agree that if you are too old for pokemon that you arent too old for yokai it is far more immature and kiddish alolan dugtrio doesnt have to make sense it is pokemon a fake world that altogether doesnt make sense sometimes opinion some people like it i left pokemon before sinnoh and only came back to play that gen after black sinnoh was in no way pokemons prime not supported by popular opinion or sales the anime is for children if he were too intellectual he wouldnt be as relatable for the intended audience what about this your favorite gen is an opinion and doesnt matter pokemon go got many people that either left pokemon or had never played pokemon to play a pokemon game it has made tons of money it brings communities together with many real events across cities it got people to go outside where is the embarrassment this doesnt mean other gens will never have altered forms just not in this game why is this such a big deal they should have it for gen to draw in more players either that are only familiar with the first gen from their childhood or pokemon go players i dont get your reference here also your opinion also one that most would not likely agree with i am not too old for this bullshit and neither are most other people who like pokemon enough to be involved with a subreddit dedicated to talking about it and sharing our appreciation if you dont like pokemon anymore maybe you are just growing out of it doesnt mean it is getting worse you just dont find yourself interested without nostalgia fueling your experience summary you probably have just outgrown it take a breath and focus on something else you actually enjoy
pokemon,removed,link is obviously nsfw
pokemon,removed,i would love one but you arent supposed to post trades here only giveaway
pokemon,removed,does it mean youre butthurt
pokemon,removed,also madly unpopular opinion by midnight lycanroc looks like gay furry porn and i cannot stand it

pokemon,removed,on another note we even got a donald trump pokemon this gen is definitely a unique one
pokemon,removed,invited you in to enjoy the characters with both theme and design thats literally a nonsense statement if you tried to say something like that to artists or designers youd be laughed out of the building thats a pretentious unsubstantiated statement you have nostalgia blinders on outside of about the last thirty in the gen dex youre talking about a rock with eyes a ball with eyes two blobs a magnet that evolves into three magnets a bunch of rocks put together with eyes a tapir with shorts a caterpillar a caterpillar with a horn two cocoons a bee a butterfly and the list goes on and on
pokemon,removed,oh no this guy is gonna get rule so hard
pokemon,removed,racist
pokemon,removed,you know him you know the one you go up to the bar and hes like this suit is uh officially its a giorgio armani ech my dad knows him fuck you
pokemon,removed,after reading that comment chain you seems like the passive aggressive one
pokemon,removed,spoilers dude seriously you are the reason there are posts every day for the past week reminding people to flag things as a spoiler and why the rules for titles for spoilers changed
pokemon,removed,people are such spoiler whores its a pokemon if anyone is complaining about spoilers youre just a whiny brat
pokemon,removed,no i worry that this sub is full of absolute mush for brains that have to be told multiple times something is not true because they lack the attention span to follow the leaks themselves then brigade the person until they realize they were indeed wrong and delete their chain like they never went off on a tangent themselves if you really must know people saw kalos as a possible met location fucking obviously and thought kalos was going to be an explorable location within the game it makes this an extremely annoying place to be during leaks
pokemon,removed,lol you missed the previous deleted comments it would seem who asked me for a source and when i provided their lazy asses with a source swiftly deleted their comment dude information is spreading fast and everyones super excited theres no malintent here lol what when has ignorance ever been an excuse to post misinformation though theres literally no reason to post those are alternate forms when minutes of searching could find the plethora of datamined info that came out in the last day that is currently the most credible source anyone has i guess someone spamming that they think its alternate forms without any form of source of their own is somehow not shitposting though just those that correct them
pokemon,removed,i was expecting a shrek is love shrek is life ending especially considering luchalibres penis tail
pokemon,removed,you literally came here like hours later to say this not seeing any of the chain before it was completely removed and the fact that this information was not new minutes before or after i posted it it was like hours old im not really sure you have any idea of what youre talking about but if you need to white knight that badly for plebs then by all means continue
pokemon,removed,poses ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ｔｈｉｓ ｍｕｓｔ ｂｅ ｔｈｅ ｗｏｒｋ ｏｆ ａｎ ｅｎｅｍｙ 「ｓｔａｎｄ」！！ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ
pokemon,removed,well i dont think you can say primeape looks like infernape just like there is dog pokemon every gen and nobody seems against that so saying is out of place because hawlucha exist in kinda weird then i guess he kinda looks like emboarbut as you said its firedark it isnt fat its not a pig he actually his the only fire starter that fight and behave like a total douchebag the only real thing they have in common is that they stands on two legs im not sure about emboar being a wrestlerunlike pignite dont get me wrong i understand you dont like it but the argument of it already exist is poor especially in a game with more than pokemon
pokemon,removed,bow down before the god of death
pokemon,removed,wtf is up with team skull they are really lame like extremely lame like every white guy into rap metal in the late lame and that big sis admin chick wtf is up with her is her thong hanging out or what

pokemon,removed,no she doesnt
pokemon,removed,luchlitten is just the most broad and obvious example of a pokemon that does not look like it natural evolved from one form to another umm octillery would like to have a word besides ive been pointing out that most of the starters are biped even if you remove the fire types completely i think you actually like quadrupedal pokemon because that happens to be the popular idea going around the community right now
pokemon,removed,lol same to you comments disappearing one by one but mine are all here still what could that possibly tell you
pokemon,removed,haha yeah im raging over here buddy welcome to the party youre about the person in a row to instead of providing discussion relevant to the leaks decided to play armchair therapist and tell me im angry good one really original post
pokemon,removed,it would be make sense but in other hand i dont think gamefreak might have thought about the english vocabulary but again in third hand we have trumpmon sowhy not
pokemon,removed,get fucked you also forget that we are getting a shit ton of alolan forms which might as well be new pokemon
pokemon,removed,lol yall should give me some red votes
pokemon,removed,no whats embarrassing is anyone can tell my entire comment chain is intact while the several of you are deleting what you said just for you to come back and post about me needing to calm down or im angry im not the one sending the several of you private messages or deleting a single thing i said to hide anything that wasnt true whats embarrassing is you cannot handle the fact that i was right and thats really sad

pokemon,removed,i think its really not any concern of yours what other people do with their games letting what other people do to their experience doesnt automatically mean the devaluing or the detriment of yours if you still want to do those things who is stopping you it could be a sense of pride that you wanted to do it yourself but i personally cannot understand how other people tailoring their game experience affects literally anyone else unless theyre hacking in broken illegal things and trying to play with them in a competitive setting which i believe thanks to hack checks is pretty much impossible dont let what other people are doing affect you
pokemon,removed,i bet the consideration is appreciated and i hate being the first comment being so negative but my first thought when seeing this was i played pokemon instead of taking care of my sick dog please prove me wrong

pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,ive seen alot of his posts before he knows next to nothing about pokemon outside of go
pokemon,removed,pikachu is at almost every disadvantage against a tyranitar and its moveset really isnt going to do it favors though ill grant it at least has iron tail for a supereffective hit if you want to make an adaptation i feel like keeping more from the source material is important and choosing pikachu against tyranitar and metagross is a very unwise choice in the games why should it be praised in the anime the battle also seems to go back to kanto level rules splash tyranitar with water and suddenly electric moves deal more damage and red carried several pokemon to fight giovanni he obtained a victreebel specifically for that battle and used hitmonlee as well as going with jolteon because he taught it double kick youre overlooking a lot if you say red didnt try and come in prepared where as ash just happened to have one or two pokemon that could do well just because he happened to pick that pokemon he doesnt plan this he just goes in with what he has been using from the get go red as a character tried to switch up and build teams to give him an edge even if the writing damned him to using charizard in most of the cases where he clearly planned to use others as i said and will continue to say i think both have flaws red is not perfect a lot of the fandom hype towards him isnt even based on origins red so much as the memetic badass stance people have on red since his appearance in goldsilver as the strongest in game trainer by level origins red is however more in line with what id want to see from a trainer and i feel hes got more potential id personally love to see more battles that can use the ingame moves in unique ways like ashs buizel and his improvised moves writing can work these elements into a new medium but i feel the main anime relies too much on making up too much how often has pikachu zapped ground types for instance how can you defeat a move that literally is described as small scale reality warping by punching it how can you establish that ashgreninja isnt as strong as a mega but then have it trump against a mega that has every advantage against it i know what its like to be in a part of a fandom where youre in the minority or even constantly bashed for liking things the true fans dont i come from the transformers fandom trust me i know but im just saying i can see why people are tired of ash and why he does get the hate the yugioh comparison comes back to mind pokemon has set rules and has since it started the anime ygos card game didnt at the time of the first arc of the anime so it really did run on the power of plot fueling the things like attack the moon to me pokemon is still working in the realm of things like that despite never really needing to and im going to fault it for that even as a child i would get frustrated that type immunities were entirely ignored for the most part back in kanto also i must have grabbed the wrong translated screenshot this is it with the wording ive seen and i cannot like this as a definition of ashs style within the world of pokemon when sawyer got schooled on the exact opposite simple as that
pokemon,removed,but also when you have bad taste
pokemon,removed,theres a rom app for the android

pokemon,removed,im tired of the whole animal pokemon are the only good ones it is disgusting that every time we get a cool humanoid or mechanical pokemon its just labeled as bad design by the loud loud loud animal lovers honestly grow up and accept that people like different things i showed the final evolution of the cat to my little cousin and instead of saying ew he said wow cool sorry you didnt get yet another quadruped fire animal guys arcanine flareon ninetales litleo etc etc etc but its time to suck it up and move on without ruining it for everyone else and burying anyone who likes it under your over represented opinion
pokemon,removed,bitch im still in the cut
pokemon,removed,you literally redrew xyz ash with softer eyebrows also while i can appreciate you dont like the new look i hate the sentiment behind this post things need to develop to avoid stagnation this is a work of art that has incredibly talented people pouring their heart into it has not and should not be tailor made to suit what you what you prefer if we go down this route we end up with stagnation and crap i find this whole issue within the community to be childish and unintentionally highly disrespectful give it a chance for goodness sake you have seen trailers no matter how much you complain online there is no way you are going to prove that the way is was is better because guess what it isnt its completely subjective and no matter how much you say you arent the factor most compelling to feel this way is familiarity what if i told you ash i was a kid when pokemon first aired but you dont see my whining that ashs doesnt look like

pokemon,removed,since when i got mine in march
pokemon,removed,need code if someone is feeling gracious i have not been able to go to gamestop
pokemon,removed,someone finally said it mods remove it for something bull such as not feeling its high quality content
pokemon,removed,constantly talk of whats happening in the anime new merchandise really its definitely not on the front page influx of art its not an influx its a filtration the mods have unnecessarily stringent restrictions on what can be posted said restrictions filter out anything and everything but art
pokemon,removed,man i wish i had a booty chest so i can twerk easier ps i have some weed salad do want some﻿
pokemon,removed,umm excuse me the english version sounds weird this sounds weird no wonder it sounds weird to you youre japanese please dont watch the english version then otherwise i hate your shitty sarcasm
pokemon,removed,of course you cant and id like to see him try
pokemon,removed,k this stopped being funny after the first person did it now its just antisocial awkward kids whove been going to the gym for months and feel like this is a justified way to show of their mediocre bodies while at the same time not having to talk to anyone or show their faces
pokemon,removed,and heres diglett
pokemon,removed,thats called vandalism
pokemon,removed,even if its reported it doesnt get removed half the time especially screenshots that become popular and when reported mods dont remove them when screenshots are against the rules
pokemon,removed,this is just a cheap excuse to be a douche bag and show your perfect chilled abs lol
pokemon,removed,look at it this way snails are stereotypically associated with french cuisine and kalos didnt reference this
pokemon,removed,how are jessie and james not canon they have been in the anime since the first series

pokemon,removed,im not talking about game canon im talking about pokemon canon in pokemon canon jessie and james do not exist in pokemon canon ash does not exist in pokemon canon every single legendary in the universe was not awoken by and quelled by the efforts of one stupid kid who cant even beat a single pokemon league in pokemon canon the anime is not considered the anime is an offshoot it is not canon and it never has been pokemon yellow is based on the anime it is filled with noncanon references to jessie and james who are not canon
pokemon,removed,this is so dumb i hope you fucking die
pokemon,removed,so how does jessie and james not being cannon make yellow not cannon and jessie and james are only not game cannon but their unamed characters are
pokemon,removed,and penis or dick or some variant especially if it can learn harden
pokemon,removed,that is racist

pokemon,removed,hello from na here i kinda missed the ha birds and mew is anybody is willing to give me the unused codes for them i really would appreciate it
pokemon,removed,a little bit of a strange question but does anyone have any ideas of where to get a good rom of pokemon snakewood or reborn everywhere i go its bad files
pokemon,removed,love you too mods ♥
pokemon,removed,people that dont read modern comic books but yeah holding up red skull as a trump analogue and comparing people with different political views than them to nazis is definitely a selling point its pretty interesting in a trainwreckinprogress sort of way
pokemon,removed,please dont capitalize god when you dont mean the christian god
pokemon,removed,its more that it makes it clear what you are referring to god capital g is pretty universally the judeochristian god and there are many examples of gods in myths that arent god
pokemon,removed,no code begging no code begging it will get you a temporary ban
pokemon,removed,if youre trying to talk to someone use the reply button otherwise no code begging it will get you a temporary ban
pokemon,removed,if youre participating in a giveaway you have to reply to the person otherwise your comment could be seen as code begging and you could get banned
pokemon,removed,i wish to be banned to punish myself for crimes that i deny being any part of before i go through with this there are two things id like to know what is the duration of the temporary ban can i have a code pretty please my was registered on the surface of the sun so i can only accept a code from that region its fine if you can only give me half a code or a single letter of a code because the unbearably hot temperature of the sun burned the rest away

pokemon,removed,well we can all tell which kid you like the least
pokemon,removed,went to every gamestop around me in a mile radius today and they either didnt have anymore or just didnt get them at all
pokemon,removed,if anyone still has a volcano on code i will be going to gamestop tomorrow to grab a few he sect codes and if i cant get a volcano on would be willing to swap just pm me
pokemon,removed,thats fantastic
pokemon,removed,fucking gay bro
pokemon,removed,would love two na codes if there are any available thanks
pokemon,removed,who are so many europeans upset that they have to wait a few days for a mediocre game
pokemon,removed,if anyone has an extra code could they pm me
pokemon,removed,if i could get a code ill be really grateful thanks
pokemon,removed,how is it that gamestop dont have card codes yet since november is the first day of the distribution it doesnt make sense to print them on receipt they should have receive them earlier i guess getting them on receipts is better than nothing but still
pokemon,removed,i find funny the way you have to quote two particular parts again and again i must have left quite an impression on you with that one eh you simply are not capable of seeing anything else than your original this is the fact and dont want to question the consequences behind it even a little theres no point in trying to talk with you you are set on what you already know and theres no room for anything else just like i predicted before this semblance of a dialogue became annoying quickly all you do is stating the same thing over and over again and complaining that i attack you you didnt actually debate at all when i clearly wrote a lot more than you did to support my point of view according to the messages that youve searched even though you tried to make it seem like its the same thing possibly because its easier to try to negate what people say instead of finding arguments on your own maybe thats why you find me passiveaggressive because im the only one actually saying something in my opinion my point is and always was that incineroar is the closest thing that could have been made instead of another firefighting starter and i brought proofs to back it up whether you all like it or not arguably not a ton but still much more than the other side so yeah ill just say thanks for trying and please do not see any sarcasm in this sentence thank you very much and a cordial goodbye
pokemon,removed,they are literal infants they havent played any video games yet you fucking moron
pokemon,removed,may i have a code plz
pokemon,removed,hope the parents live long enough to see their kids grown up three kids is a lot to handle no doubt but being obese will leave the kids without parents and possibly their own kids without grandparents
pokemon,removed,oh here we go again posters read the notice no begging that includes pls hey i coulda use one tagging for codes etc line up and wait for someone to give you codes
pokemon,removed,ill leave this here for you
pokemon,removed,called all gamestops i drive by for work none received any of them actually remember me and said they will call when they get some the girl i always talk to at another said she thinks that super large population cities might be getting them first so i called a random gamestop in atlaim in huntsville alabama and they have stacks
pokemon,removed,not very happy about nintendo ik it gets us out the house but id rather not do a drive for genesect thanks d
pokemon,removed,i cant see why not as i can clone them anytime i want whats your fc and id ill give you mine when i get home also is it allowed by the subreddit rules to arrange trades like these ill have to look into that
pokemon,removed,im still confused how do you get a code from the thread
pokemon,removed,if you will just give them out id like to ask for one if youre making further contests ill try to catch them in time to participate thanks for sharing codes anyway its very hard for many of us to get one id need to drive for hours to get to the nearest participating store from where i live
pokemon,removed,sorry im new to claiming from codes it only works once per account right
pokemon,removed,can i have a code too pls thanks
pokemon,removed,there isnt a gamestop anywhere near me which is irritating if anyone has a spare code going im more than happy to gift them something small on steam or whathaveyou

pokemon,removed,honestly if youre pathetic enough to care about the roster being spoiled get the fuck off a pokemon dedicated discussion place
pokemon,removed,you realize your dad was doing this because his child was interested in pokemon right the difference here is that youre still a child in a grown mans body fucking infantilism

pokemon,removed,looking through the tms surprises me i mean tm safeguard does anybody actually use this tm tm frustration so why is this still a tm tm leech life tm quash literally one of the least useful moves in the entire game tm confide isnt confide literally the special attack version of growl
pokemon,removed,i thought that place was blasted off harder than team rocket cool to see its back but it looks like the radiation messed up that gyarados colour
pokemon,removed,looks like you guys could use some pokemon go yeah the picture is super cute and all but if the both of you do not make some life style changes youre dooming those triplets to a life of hardship start now that way by the time their old enough to form memories the have a happy and healthy mom and dad to look up to good luck
pokemon,removed,i went to gamestops yesterday and the first one told me they didnt get the codes in yet but they were supposed to and the second store the guy said he had no idea what we were talking about and that there wasnt an event so if anyone had any luck id like two please if thats allowed im not begging just asking lol
pokemon,removed,i dont know how to pm but we can trade i have an extra keldeo
pokemon,removed,anyone have an extra code for this guy who cant go to a gamestop d

pokemon,removed,its literally the same process as taking a picture on your phone putting the micro sd card in your pc then dragging and dropping it to a new device the target age of pokemons audience is given the age of your trainer what kind of year old hasnt figured out how to put an sd card or any kind of storage media into a pc hell i know kids even younger than this have figured out how to plug a device into a pc they figured it out with iphones and ipods and who said anything about spending a few hundred dollars sd card readers are built in to pcs and usb sd card readers are dirt cheap do you know what an sd card is have you seen an sd card slot theyre dirt cheap their readers are dirt cheap and they have wide scale compatibility not to mention that data can be sent wirelessly so if nintendo really wanted to hold peoples hand all the way through they could implement the ability to transfer the data wirelessly through pokebank to a new device on the same network aka on the same wifi connection how do you think you battle online and trade on gts your data and your opponents data is sent wirelessly to each other back and forth data can also be sent through infrared how do you think two can trade with each other when theyre close by how do you think quick link in sunmoon sends data to both for trades and battles pokebank is not cheaper for the consumer there are tons of other technological solutions already available that game freak couldve implemented

pokemon,removed,maybe together we can get quality posts on here make rpokemon great again
pokemon,removed,still no pics and only nerds would look up stats to find the new pokemon the obvious search is all new pokemon of sun and moon and that search gives no results if all i had to search was code poke sun and moon statistics number and if the first link would give me an entire file with everything i needed including picures it wouldnt matter because no one in their right mind would think to search that only people who already know that search will give the desired know its like searching for a song you heard of which you know how it goes the tune but you dont know the lyrics so all you can search for is naa nah nah nah nah only difference is what i was searching for were the actually lyrics and apparently in order to find the song you shouldnt have searched using the lyrics you shouldve used specific word out of the entire song no way i couldve known that i hope you can rap your head around it if you cant youre too far gone
pokemon,removed,lol youre you are a fuckin kid and for the record im i have a complete living pokedex i have the pokedex certificate framed and on my desk at work along with paintings of pokemon on my office wall tell your dad to suck it
pokemon,removed,k i recognize your behavior now i know you youre the kind of person that is first very unrespectful aggressive and abusive and when that same behavior is reflected back onto them acts like they never were like that in the first place im not expert but it looks exactly like schizophrenia split personality disorder the abuser and the innocent you switch between them at will in attempt to control the situation you never truly become present i wonder if you even know what becoming present truly means if you have even experienced it you probably have but you probably blame it on outside factors completely ignorant to the fact that you are the one who is capable of become present theres no point in discussing logic with you because youll twist and turn and change your mind the minute you dont make sense youll never admit to making mistakes and therefore youll never grow and learn and will always stay in the same place i wish you the best of luck with your life i hope you can at least find some sort of peace but as for this little conversation back the fuck off its over dont make a fool of yourself
pokemon,removed,please
pokemon,removed,i would punch him in the fucking mouth for you

pokemon,removed,do what makes you happy and content your not hurting anything by enjoying a game so i would tell him to fuck off but since thats not likely to be an option try asking him why he thinks its for kids and as long as your not using it to avoid school work and the like keep on playing
pokemon,removed,thanks for spoiling it for us you absolute piece of shit why cant people refrain from posting spoiler images in rpokemon learn how reddit works you fucking moron and stop ruining the game for people
pokemon,removed,each z crystal can powerup a move of its type if it is an attacking move then the super strong move will happen a physical attack will make the z move physical and vise versa if you choose to activate the z crystal on a status move like splash then a special effect will occure like attack for splash and then the normal attack you can see all the special effects
pokemon,removed,rule
pokemon,removed,afaik yes that is the case i might be wrong though but i believe that pokébank simply doesnt support gen yet mods feel free to warn me if i cant talk about this and if thats the case im sorry in advance phbank might be an alternative until then if you have cfwaccess to homebrew launcher depending on how it was made it should be only a matter of making it support gen without needing pokébank to be updated
pokemon,removed,yeah rule says you shouldnt promote without permission from the mods

pokemon,removed,combating douchiness with douchiness nice
pokemon,removed,probably because while xy might have brought back a lot of the older audience it didnt win over the kid audience in japan the adult audience is a lot less lucrative target group since they more likely watch it through an internet service and dont buy anime related merchandises kids watch it on tv and gives it a higher rating while also buying anime related merchandises

pokemon,removed,no one it should have been no one none of this makes any sense red should be off training in bizarre regions battling everybody all the time nice art style but youre not very funny comic makers dude is the joke that its all ironic because its the opposite of what red would actually end up as also if this is based off the manga red then its shown that hes attracted to girls and isnt gay in that if this is based on the games red then i suppose this makes a little bit of sense since he was only a player stand in and there are essentially a million different dimensions with a million different reds in my dimension red is essentially me and for the girls that played the games he is them more or less so not a he at all but a she so at that point youre just making a comic about yourself
pokemon,removed,yeah red isnt gay so your diluted fantasy isnt true

pokemon,removed,exactly however i disagree with making them help them self they need an authority figure to set them on the right path when i caught my son playing with his sisters dolls i made him wear one of his sisters dresses to school for a week i referred to him as a her for that week and made sure to keep denying him anything saying girls cant do that it definitely was the right move hes much more normal since then
pokemon,removed,helloim new in this website
pokemon,removed,i dont get this what if one side is total shit
pokemon,removed,what game are you talking about if your talking about sunmoon i cant answer because ive decided to not use the leaked copies and wait until the to get my preordered copies of both sun and moon if your talking about x and y lumiose city is probably the best place other than that theres that one route with the battle mason right after parfum palace which is pretty good if your talking about oras really any place will do lmao
pokemon,removed,this is a deep allegory for muslims imo
pokemon,removed,its ok its the internet you can say swears
pokemon,removed,say you should not link me a download for the demo because that would completely devastate me
pokemon,removed,as for how to contact moderators allow me ahem mods mods come look at this post i expect no payment for my services
pokemon,removed,whats your favourite team then reddit is for discussion not just being contrary bc you can its nice having a team that isnt stupid generic i cant even tell team flare plasma and whatever the other one was called apart or remember anything about them bc they were so bland
pokemon,removed,thats what your dad told me last night
pokemon,removed,its actually a little dark for pokemon kukui literally lives on another island doing his own research way more time at work than at home she might feel a bit lonely then she goes to the battle royal on her same island to kill some boredom and she sees this bronze god stroll into stage any woman would be captivated later the player is asked to deliver the masked royals mask to kukui this signified that some hankypanky went down and someone needed to let kukui know that hes become professor cuckui its messed up to make an elevenyearold child the messenger in this situation especially since the wrath of the masked royal must be as great as his oiled pecs theres some fan theories going around that since kukui and the royal might look kind of similar they could be related this would add to the drama but i personally think they dont look anything alike so im not sure i buy into it

pokemon,removed,id appreciate it if you could give me one i live pretty far from my gamestop and when i finally went there they didnt have any codes left
pokemon,removed,i think youre taking incorrect grammar too seriously people make mistakes and if you always take their grammar seriously and ignore context youre gonna be mistaken a lot if you though it was strange you could have just asked him what he meant i didnt realize there was a fruit on the tail but the tail is clearly reptilian in nature its literally a dragon typing and has a long reptilian tail the pokemon also bears fruit and again its dragon type making the connection to dragonfruit also logical even if the fruit arent red like dragonfruit are i think these connections are pretty clear you can disagree of course but you havent added anything to the discussion and just want to point out things as strange and tell people they dont know things without giving any other explanation why would you go out of your way to be rude to ushinypansear getting upvotes doesnt make it any less of a mean thing to do you could have said it doesnt really look like dragon fruit maybe its because all you did was degrade the person you didnt add anything to the discussion and were just rude at least you werent vulgar i should have done it before but im gonna report you now this subreddit doesnt need passive aggressive comments that dont add to discussion and only put others down
pokemon,removed,so we cant have alolan dugtrio in hoenn for what reason theres an active volcano there ripe for the invasion or what about alolan sandshrew and vulpix of the sinnoh map is snowed or northern enviroment out im sure they couldve developed into their alolan forms in the same vein there as well i think they marketed this thing incorrectly as it implications are very easily misunderstood
pokemon,removed,dark type this quiz is racist

pokemon,removed,rule of thirds is high school level photography no one cares
pokemon,removed,the use of fun as an adjective is itself still often seen as informal or casual and to be avoided in formal writing and this would apply equally to the comparative form merriamwebster gives fun as an adjective without comment and states that funner and funnest are sometimes used

pokemon,removed,are you an idiot
pokemon,removed,is that a fact or your assumption
pokemon,removed,i feel like completing a pokemon game doesnt require much advanced strategy because it is too easy for me or anyone to just overlevel my pokemon and go its even possible to just overlevel my starter even though i dont really find that much fun so yeah i prefer design over stats in that case battling an actual human is a completely different story haha im not that competitive 😂

pokemon,removed,so as long as someones pointing out someone elses flaw such as you not being an open minded person or should i be more specific refusing to have a conversation with people who have a different point of view than yours it is an insult well i disagree people did downvote me thats a sure thing i dont need proof that you didnt and i dont really care who did it tbh i will only say again that yes i am definitely very open minded having an open mind requires having open ears and not only when people agree with you which is why i reply to people constructively not by closing a debate before it even happens create a debate over nothing you dont get to just decide whats nothing and whats not thats as simple as it gets note that never did i specified anything over the importance of said debate id be interested in hearing your point of view sorry to say but then youll have to search my other messages in the thread if you really want to i would understand it if you dont want to do that because i dont really have the patience anymore to write the other things i said again this reply is already way too long then again seeing how you react i strongly think that any argument i could use youd just reject it on principle after all incineroar is firedark right thats even written on it for god sake we shouldnt even talk about it s

series it was released in japan in december in north america in march and in europe in may the game is set on a group of islands in a vast sea—a first for the series the player controls series protagonist link as he attempts to save his sister from the sorcerer ganon and becomes embroiled in a struggle for the triforce a sacred relic that grants its holders wishes aided by allies including pirate captain tetra and a talking boat named the king of red lions link sails the ocean explores islands and traverses dungeons to acquire the power necessary to defeat ganon wind which facilitates sailing plays a prominent role and can be controlled with a magic conductors baton called the wind waker the wind waker was directed by eiji aonuma and produced by shigeru miyamoto and takashi tezuka it retains the basic gameplay of its predecessors ocarina of time and majoras mask but with a distinctive cartoonlike art style created through cel shading though the art style proved divisive among players resulting in comparatively weak sales outside japan the game received critical acclaim the wind waker originated the toon link variant of the main character and received two direct sequels for the nintendo ds phantom hourglass and spirit tracks a highdefinition remaster the legend of zelda the wind waker hd was released for the wii u in contents gameplay wind and sailing synopsis background and setting plot development game design music release and promotion reception critical reception audience response and sales legacy sequels and other media wii u version references external links gameplay the wind wakers celshaded art style makes use of realtime lighting and effects like depthoffield blur making the game look stylistically similar to a cartoon and setting it apart from other games in the series like ocarina of time and majoras mask wind waker is an open world actionadventure game with roleplaying elements the control scheme is comparable to its predecessors the player moves the protagonist link in three dimensions from a thirdperson perspective link fights with a sword and shield and can use a variety of other items and weapons he interacts with nonplayer characters and objects via the action button like the previous games wind waker features a targeting system allowing link to lock on and constantly face an enemy or target a new feature is the ability to move the camera system around link the game world comprises gridded sections of the great sea each containing an island or island chain some must be explored to continue the story while others are optional like all zelda games wind waker features several dungeons—large enclosed areas where link fights enemies finds items and solves puzzles to continue each dungeon quest concludes with a battle against a boss a singularly powerful enemy in addition to the main story the game includes many sidequests minor objectives the player can optionally complete to attain rewards for example link can use the picto box – an ingame camera – to take pictures to fulfill quests throughout the game link acquires items and weapons providing new abilities items are often needed to reach certain areas defeat bosses and other enemies and advance the story for example the grappling hook is necessary to pass obstacles and defeat the boss in the dragon roost cavern dungeon it can then be used to enter previously inaccessible areas the tingle tuner is a special item allowing a second player to control the character tingle if the system is connected to a game boy advance by a link cable wind and sailing a significant portion of the game is spent sailing between islands on links boat the king of red lions the boats sail is driven by wind that blows across the game world in one of eight directions a tailwind behind the boat will give it top speed while sailing against the wind is difficult the great sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear on land some items serve new purposes on the king of red lions for instance the grappling hook serves as a crane for recovering sunken treasure link explores the sea with the help of a sea chart which can be updated with information on each square and island through the game link acquires additional charts pointing the way to treasure chests and significant locations on land dungeons feature similar maps early in the game link receives the titular wind waker a baton that allows him to control the wind and gain other powers when he conducts specific melodies the player controls the wind waker by moving the joypads to change pitch and time signature the first melody the winds requiem enables link to change the winds direction allowing him to sail toward any location link can learn five other tunes for the wind waker which provide abilities such as warping to other regions through cyclones and turning night to day synopsis background and setting according to the legend of zelda hyrule historia nintendos official legend of zelda chronology the wind waker takes place in the new world timeline one of several parallel timelines in which zelda games are set following the events of ocarina of time the game follows the adult link sequence from ocarina after link the hero of time defeats ganon and timetravels back to his childhood a crisis emerged when ganon returned but link did not centuries later the people live on islands in the great sea they preserve links story as a legend but his kingdoms fate is unknown the main character a young boy also named link lives on outset island where boys dress in green like the hero of time when they come of age

pokemon,removed,ive gotten a few good things from wondertrade but the two best were a random kartana sometime after thanksgiving and a tapu lele just before new years i still have the former and i traded the tapu for a lunala since i had link traded my original to get solgaleo
pokemon,removed,i am deeply triggered by this image as i sexually identify as an attack helicopter ever since i was a boy i dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners people say to me that a person being a helicopter is impossible and im fucking retarded but i dont care im beautiful im having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades mm cannons and hellfire missiles on my body from now on i want you guys to call me apache and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly if you cant accept me youre a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege thank you for being so understanding
pokemon,removed,time for another fail honestly there are plenty of videos covering why so i dont feel the need to reiterate it too much but nintendo needs to provide more incentive for us players to participate especially people like myself with pkhex access because if i want i can just stock up thousands of festival coins through pkhex

pokemon,removed,thats horrible
pokemon,removed,i would like a volcanion code
pokemon,removed,exactly the odds of getting a ditto in a chain are and thats because its guaranteed legends are only guaranteed so the odds of a perfect are even lower then add in the fact that you only have a chance of the proper nature when using a synchronizer and its easy to see that these pokémon are not legit
pokemon,removed,f to pay respects

pokemon,removed,soyoure complaining about not having an option for an ability thats only useful against liketwo pokemon
pokemon,removed,hey mods if youre going to keep removing peoples threads for asking simple questions the least you could do is sticky this one especially so folks like me browsing new to help out and whatnot can find this thread easier on mobile having it part of the stupid layout helps no one who isnt using the desktop site
pokemon,removed,yes i would like one to if you have the time to help my training out
pokemon,removed,dude smogon doesnt mean crap if you are playing sun and moon wifi battles smogon doesnt matter unless you are specifically fighting friends you know or people you have arranged to fight via smogon rules you keep bringing it up like its law and everyone follows it but its not you are gonna run into ubers and all kinds of pokemon on wifi because on wifi people just want to have fun and use their legendaries or whatever smogon rules are really only relevant on pokemon showdown you gotta know when to shut that mindset off i remember i was challenge to a friendly battle with some person i met on a chat room once and we never talked about smogon or any other rules it straight up was like hey you wanna battle and i was like sure few minutes later they are butthurt i beat them using my greninja and mega lucario and they complained i used ubers and they couldnt respect a winner who uses ubers or some junk point is they put an unnecessary limit on themselves and wrongly thought everyone who plays pokemon obeys smogon like its gospel and they got their tail spanked just have fun and use your favorite pokemon
pokemon,removed,this came from pokemon showdown unbunch your panties
pokemon,removed,you should try making sense
pokemon,removed,no one plays smogon rules outside simulators in my experience who cares

pokemon,removed,finally got my meloetta from mystery gift looking over the list and my card album and i see that the only one i missed is jirachi how did everyone else do also is there still giveaways going on i have a spare volcanion if someone can jirachi me
pokemon,removed,they wont do it like bw because they are trying to slim down the pokedex honestly im just hoping the next game featuring new pokemon actually has good designs gens have such bad designs it makes the games laughable every generation has their good and bad ones but the standards for the last gens have been aweful
pokemon,removed,woah just woah you really dont know what you are talking about do you
pokemon,removed,saying something is subjective is saying that there isnt a point in arguing because an opinion cannot be correct or incorrect it is redundant but arguing opinions is far more and it only yields people wasting their time

pokemon,removed,its not the same thing here he had a chance of winning the equivalent would be a meter penalty kick without a goalie in soccer but being unable to take it because there is a rule that says that the other team can have you wait until the game is over it makes no sense

pokemon,removed,they are apparently a time use so all i got
pokemon,removed,hey just in case anybody is interested in the shirt you can purchase it at we do have a contract with jordan
pokemon,removed,not much time left to clam someone with an extra code should give it to someone before its to late d pick me
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,admins here are a bunch of bitches so if you post something think to yourself if i was a little bitch would this bother me if the the answer is yes then dont post it welcome to rpokemon its almost like if you dont want a spoiler you should stay off the fucking page dedicated to the subject you do the want spoiled or something but thats none of my business
pokemon,removed,as someone who works in retail i can tell you first hand if you got a problem with limited releases take it up with the producerdeveloper we want to sell as much as we can thats the point of retail business they are the ones limiting our supply to give to you its an issue of forced rarity not underbuying
pokemon,removed,those are just a select of around unique keychains i made
pokemon,removed,sure httpsoftmonkeychainsdeviantartcom theres no much there regarding crafts yet but soon enough i will present brand new varieties for commission
pokemon,removed,hum theres one time i did a mightyena keychain a simple one but hey if you are interested to get your own we can talk about it
pokemon,removed,do you have any place i can watch this
pokemon,removed,ah those keychains are from earlier commissions later i have arranged more options such as place the keyring outside the character i have four different varieties and they range from to
pokemon,removed,sponge eva and balsa
pokemon,removed,i dont have an etsy unfortunately but i handle commissions by myself including the shipment thus why its cheap you can consult this sheet its all the information you need
pokemon,removed,i use sponge eva and balsa i dont have an etsy shop because those are actually custom commissions you can learn all of it by this sheet alone
pokemon,removed,i would love a mew for my pokedex but i wish luck for everyone thank you very much for giving away codes
pokemon,removed,i never did a klefki before which is too bad as they are interesting particularly for being keychain mons all the examples are commissions so the species can only be arranged if someone orders me to
pokemon,removed,hey op your thread got removed is the giveaway still going on
pokemon,removed,the commissions can be available now but as im new here did read in the rules that self advertisement is forbidden thus why i showed just a portion of the work but you can learn everything in this sheet and feel free to contact me
pokemon,removed,those are individual commissions from the past but in a nutshell i do keychains of anything you can name even ocs theres all the information in just one sheet
pokemon,removed,hey im trading my lv shiny yveltal for some other pokemon two help me get some data back i was two years into the game and last night and the only way two fix it so i could play it was bye deleting all my data so can you help me out pls i would really like that so if so im playing alpha sapphire and my username is slogoman fan so just send me a trade if you can help me out i was so mad last night that it all got deleted so im going two need some help im just training right know but i miss my swampert

pokemon,removed,all the tapus are good youre high
pokemon,removed,hey friend reread my post p anabel is from emerald right okay nice thats exactly what i said in the post p im just saying that this doesnt means that the prexy games are not canon to the new ones
pokemon,removed,well what i did was not a theory exactly i only said that this theory about older games being not canon has no evidence i wanted to show people that contrary to what they thought some ideas implied in xy were not retconned thanks anyway d
pokemon,removed,yes i definitely agree with that the reason i posted this is because i see a lot of people saying things like we dont know anything about the battle tree red because he is from the mega universe and things like that my understanding of canon is that when you say that a game is canon youre saying that the events of these games are considered to have happened in some universe saying frlg is canon to sunmoon as far as i understand would be the exact same thing as saying when making sunmoon gamefreak will consider the events of frlg as having happened in this world while gamefreak doesnt makes a remake of the old games then they will themselves consider the events of these games canon but yeah youre right in your conception of canon but in mine if the events of the mega universe and of the non mega universe are pretty much the same then both will be canon p
pokemon,removed,jan
pokemon,removed,i made an edit to make that more clear thanks d
pokemon,removed,just saw this on teefury httpwwwteefurycom

pokemon,removed,lol pokegay is for f faggots edit who downvoted me if your going to do that then at least give me a reason why for christs sake
pokemon,removed,i got here as soon as i could how bad is it im talking about how upset i am with these pokemon my god this was sad to watch
pokemon,removed,even milotic my eyes cant take such beautyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
pokemon,removed,triggered
pokemon,removed,im not sure how its been here but reddit mods in general have been on an insane power trip site wide lately honestly wouldnt be surprised to get my whole account deleted just for this comment pointing out the incredible overcensorship that is a very very real problem with the site as it is
pokemon,removed,thanks just bought one use coupon code for off shirt was with shipping
pokemon,removed,gross im glad they didnt obey the mod gods should we make a blood offering when asking for permission as well
pokemon,removed,as per the rules we cant link you to any site that isnt official if its not on pokemoncom google will have to help you out
pokemon,removed,if you still have any codes could you pm me one
pokemon,removed,it is confirmed that rpokemon mods hate all posts about the anime and prefer the subreddit to be rpokemonfanart sorry for ranting but you guys have fucked up for the last time for me
pokemon,removed,wow you really sound like an entitled sniveling shit mods do their jobs so dumb shit doesnt flood your thread they do it based on the rules of the sub reddit this post breaks one of those rules but they figured it should be here anyway thats what mods do
pokemon,removed,if you saw the amount of fake leaks we receive on an almost daily basis youd be more understanding of the dictatorship we are running here weve always been extremely transparent with our reasoning for the rules and most of the rules were voted in by the community itself thats called democracy for the record its extremely frustrating to be continually blamed regardless of what action we take if any at all we ask users send us a link to a video before they post it if they think it might be factual just so we can attempt to fact check it in the real world this is called peer review its largely how academia functions weve handled leaks this way since diamond and pearl and theres never been a complaint about it sending a pm saying hey can you check this quickly isnt a huge request we arent dictators were one of the few subreddits where the moderators actually take the time to answer user questions in threads while also doing our duties we arent fachisists just individual and bots were sorry we cant please every single one of our subscribers
pokemon,removed,someone might have just got carried away and forgot or is too young to realise what would happen i dont even know what free store is im starting to think im out of touch
pokemon,removed,i think all the pirate hate is ridiculous its honestly just jealous lazy bitter people angry at the fact that others get to play the game before they do maybe thats not the case but seriously how many of these haters have downloaded and played other pokemon roms and fan games official or not did not pay a single penny to their creators without giving it a second thought my guess is a large majority when i was a kid i and everyone i knew downloaded the half translated japanese roms of pokémon gold and silver we were kids and we had an absolute blast seeing this new content months before it was officially released in the us did this prevent us from going out the day of the na release and buying an official copy fuck no we were excited as fuck that preview only heightened our excitement point being a great product will be purchased by those with the means to because of the quality of the product those without the money or ability to purchase a product ie kids will still be fans and consumers none the less and will promote the product with their enthusiasm its a winwin for nintendo in this case and those that think that nintendo has lost a lot of money through this leak are dead wrong
pokemon,removed,reminds me of verlis
pokemon,removed,maybe these people shouldnt steal a product a team of people spent literal years developing seems pretty fair to me
pokemon,removed,boys shouldnt play with men
pokemon,removed,agreed
pokemon,removed,because they didnt know it was gonna get leaked it doesnt matter that it got leaked this leak wasnt some magic one time thing that allowed piracy of pokemon and nothing else every game can be easily pirated because the system has been completely broken the moment any game is released legitimate copies will be available for piracy straight off of nintendos servers if you had the means to pirate pokemon already all this leak did was give you the game days earlier so hes right all this affected was a handful of people who installed cfw to play pokemon early a really small percentage of users because you had to have not updated your for a long time to easily pull it off youre getting upvoted because youre taking moral stance while he isnt but youre completely ignorant of the subject matter at hand and no im not supporting piracy taking the moral high ground doesnt mean youre right though
pokemon,removed,why is downvoting based on opinion against the rules if many dumb fucks are just gonna break it anyways
pokemon,removed,dont know why youre getting downvoted youre not wrong it wasnt of the players it was a handful of people most of whom have mentioned theyll be purchasing the game when it comes out anyway that downloaded the leaked game i doubt nintendo wouldve even noticed if they stayed offline
pokemon,removed,your horrified that they are paying for their game or did you post from a phone
pokemon,removed,and youre an ignorant clod not all of us pirate things because we want to stick it to the man some of us live in poverty and cant afford every thing we want and we sometimes resort to piracy because theres no other option id rather do this and to live a life with no pokemon would you
pokemon,removed,tldr butthurt bloke upset that people like what he doesnt like
pokemon,removed,why dont people just buy the game instead of being cheap assholes
pokemon,removed,f
pokemon,removed,whats wrong with low self esteem mocking people who have it spoiled egotistical punk
pokemon,removed,welcome back wolf pack
pokemon,removed,well good thing i dont care what verlisify does since im not subbed to him besides lycanroc has other charming points its pink eyes silly grin and big paws remind me of a digimon are you going to tell me that sweet and lovable guilmon who shares a color scheme with lycanroc is also edgy i say thats a plus for me
pokemon,removed,i wonder how the view is on your high horse
pokemon,removed,i hated gen v so much the story the pokemon the npcs everything when it first came out my best friends and i all got it and made it to about the gym before we all lost interest and put it in the back of a drawer to collect dust i finally played it all the way through so that i could transfer my gen pokemon to pokebank it was one of the most painfully grueling video game experiences of my life i was only able to push my way through it because i didnt want to lose my awesome shiny collection from gen ill never be convinced that gen was any good
pokemon,removed,lmao the only sensible comment on this thread full of butthurt fanboys and its downvoted to hell
pokemon,removed,took a week off of work for pokemon sister told my gma gma coming to town for the week fuck you sister
pokemon,removed,is there any emulator of nds that i can play pokemon x or y ive been skipping a lot of pokemons p if there is one pm with the link so i can download it
pokemon,removed,can anyone tell me on what site i could watch this episode i usually use kissanime but they dont have it yet
pokemon,removed,look on the bright side as of last tuesday yours is no longer the biggest political fuck up of the year america anything britain can do we can do better since
pokemon,removed,the amount of people who think the only reason to hack your is to pirate is too damn high
pokemon,removed,you make it sound like there was no way anybody would be able to pirate the game until this leak happened every game is very easily pirated on this console on day one this did not affect anybody who was already planning to buy it nobody with a hacked console saw this and went alright now i dont have to pay they already didnt have to most of us choose to anyways because despite popular belief most adult console hackers do it for reasons other than piracy modding importing games cheats emulators save management screen recording future proofing your console there are so many reasons other than piracy theres a lot of people in this sub that do not understand the subject at hand and more that refuse to even try only wanting to demonstrate their supposed moral purity
pokemon,removed,thanks link for those interested httpswwwfacebookcompokeanidb
pokemon,removed,alright bud you try playing sun and moon and not being super hyped about all the new pokemon ash acted the same in xy they just chucked in the garchomp plot to give those episodes an antagonist sumo on the other hand is perfectly fine with having less serious episodes that are still entertaining
pokemon,removed,pokemon right
pokemon,removed,havent watched in a while but i am curious still no serena
pokemon,removed,you can watch kissanime they have a huge selection of anime over there
pokemon,removed,i have a genesect code to give away looking for a melloetta if possible
pokemon,removed,any subbed videos i can only seem to find raws on youtube
pokemon,removed,it took about two weeks for the fan dubs on kissanime from what i remember id always watch the raws first and get along with just enjoying team rockets antics then watch the subs when they released
pokemon,removed,theyre hacked but if you want i can temporarily trade both to you to register them in your dex
pokemon,removed,used safe space unironically kys

pokemon,removed,scrub question incoming where can i watch the first episode and is it subbed or dubbed
pokemon,removed,for anyone that already has the game quick question im a huge pokemon competitive fan but my fav game mode is singles unfortunatly in previous games there are no singles in battlespot and singles is a joke so if you wanted to do a battle you would have to go through all your passerby look for someone that says battle challange him then wait like mins to see if he replies if he doesnt gotta find someone els it was a bit too much so my question is has battling people in matchup and challenging them become more streamlined thank you
pokemon,removed,because you said that the prof is the champion its just a game you dont need to be so harsh and talk about killing
pokemon,removed,theres sand in that p
pokemon,removed,why should i i get the game early and for free winwin if you ask me
pokemon,removed,rule be damned i suppose
pokemon,removed,thats bad i had a video pop up that was literally titled comsmoem evolves into lunala and im just like bro why you gotta be such a garbage human
pokemon,removed,you could get the game over week ago
pokemon,removed,i got my copy a week ago and for free xd
pokemon,removed,what a loser
pokemon,removed,makes sense i mean cause you cant sneak up on black people
pokemon,removed,at least he doesnt have flippers with fucking fingers fucking transgender seal with fingers wtf game freak
pokemon,removed,with lillie being associated with the egg in the opening id guess that its that alolan vulpix that we saw her with in the poster maybe the egg is brown because kanto vulpix is brown but when its brought to the alola region it hatches into an alolan vulpix maybe thats the reason why oak had ash bring the egg to oak to test a theory about alolan forms

pokemon,removed,is this a shitpost
pokemon,removed,years ago i used to collect pokemon cards like a vast majority of the people here and back then they had stores dedicated to cards and comics and the one near me would sell japanese pokemon card sets i also had the one with eevee espeon umbreon entei pichi charizard and unown spelling neo the good ol days
pokemon,removed,so basicallythis shows the typical drooling over kanto due to nostalgia followed by the slow decline of people becoming less interested in the anime despite sinnoh being the best region behind kalos and then showing how xyz quickly rose to fame that final episode is only the ashgreninja vs mega charizard rematch so things will rise more from there votes are also skewed a bit kanto has a larger sample sized although more biased towards nostalgic binge watching with votes around to per episode when every other region has votes under or per episode
pokemon,removed,i missed out on this event and it really crushed me because im a big xernes fan can you send me one of those codes
pokemon,removed,any chance i could get a code

pokemon,removed,does yungoos evolve into donald trump
pokemon,removed,gumshoos went on full trump
pokemon,removed,lol gumshoos is trump
pokemon,removed,grumshoos looks even more like trump ahahahaha
pokemon,removed,gumshoos looks even more like trump
pokemon,removed,anyone else feel like gumshoo looks like trump in a
pokemon,removed,gumshoos line is a trump impression
pokemon,removed,when gumshoos looks even more like donald trump
pokemon,removed,gumshoos donald trump
pokemon,removed,not sure why we need an icy vulpix or sandshrew why not make them new pokémon altogether holy shit donald trump is a pokémon are zmoves like the limit breaks of the pokémon series seems like a cool idea if they are
pokemon,removed,is gumshoo based of trump
pokemon,removed,no one commenting on donald trump then
pokemon,removed,alola forms remind me of bad deviantart fan creations but i have to admit im super hyped for ice vulpix also gumshoos looks even more like trump than the little one did
pokemon,removed,notes as a fan of all things ice type and a fan of sandslash i approve of alola forms it is clear to me now that it wasnt a coincidence yungoose looks like trump mudbray confirms that i want mudsdale on my team is sophocles the orange kid from earthbound totem pokemon call for help yep its definitely earthbound thank you pokemon for not being stupid enough to let us combine our bodies with pokemon i was scared for a little bit bloom doom ign not enough water
pokemon,removed,i am definitely having that super saiyan trump mongoose on my team i know that for sure
pokemon,removed,i thought yungoosetrump jokes would stop after it evolved i would so wrong
pokemon,removed,to be honest you are right
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,im not being sour i just dont see how this is relevant to the people here on the subreddit these only interact with the game in that they light up and make sounds if that interests you you either have a mental disorder or are under
pokemon,removed,gumshoos is here to makealolagreatagain
pokemon,removed,alola ninetales and sandslash make me want to cry i need them alola exeggutor is hilarious but fitting gumshoos is literally trumpemon
pokemon,removed,gumshoos looks like donald trump
pokemon,removed,hey guys im going on holiday next week and i would love so pokemon games on my ipad air does anyone know about emulatores for ipad without jailbreak the higher the console the best i mean if there are any emulator which probably doenst better in the other hand if doesnt give me the best ds emulator and so on p thanks a lot for help sorry if im in wrong postreddit
pokemon,removed,you leave my gay water dog alone
pokemon,removed,gumshoos looks like trump
pokemon,removed,or an angry trump
pokemon,removed,you mean the trump pokemon
pokemon,removed,gumshoos looks totaly like donald trump
pokemon,removed,i like the new donald trump pokemon makealolagreatagain
pokemon,removed,does anyone else think gumshoos looks like donald trump
pokemon,removed,i personally find this awesome and i may be stoned but i love the trump looking mangoose gumshoos
pokemon,removed,i posted it but it was removed for rule its going to be used for a ring and you all know it it wont last in stores for very long
pokemon,removed,i had two things in mind when i first saw its reveal trump and gumshoe from ace attorney i didnt realize that the trumphair is supposed to be a detective hat though
pokemon,removed,fucking hell gumshoos is the donald trump pokemon
pokemon,removed,gumshoos is donald trump
pokemon,removed,the fucking mongoose is donald trump holy cow
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,i want to say that the zangoose of this game is that donald trump looking pokemon although it was used in one of the trials
pokemon,removed,donald trump confirmed
pokemon,removed,im guessing gumshoos is gonna build a wall and make pokémon great again
pokemon,removed,worried though of seeing old pokemon resurface that this generation will not have new pokemon i like the frost forms but seeing something like excegute have a new form and the trump pokemon being a totem something that should probably have been a legendary scares me into thinking that weve already seen about half of the generation﻿
pokemon,removed,hoenn is gonna pay for the wall
pokemon,removed,im name mine trumpd
pokemon,removed,or trump hiding his small hands behind his back
pokemon,removed,gumshoos reminds me of a certain
pokemon,removed,it has donald trumps hair
pokemon,removed,to be honest thats exactly what i am thinking right after i posted that comment and read the other comments ill try ask the mods
pokemon,removed,are we just not going to talk about how gumshoos has donald trumps hair is that we just gonna pretend it isnt a thing then
pokemon,removed,sorry mate the censors wont let you name him dick
pokemon,removed,theres no way this isnt trump game freakcreatures we see you
pokemon,removed,gumshoos looks like trump hahaha
pokemon,removed,gumshoos is donald trump right
pokemon,removed,is a black person really a person if its not white
pokemon,removed,anyone else think gumshoos has trumo hair
pokemon,removed,is gumshoos final attack youre fired
pokemon,removed,gumshoos is running for president of alola
pokemon,removed,trumpgoose is life no but seriously wow this is a ton of stuff i honestly didnt expect i read that the director is the one from oras but he couldnt do a lot of innovation because those were remakes but i believe hes on the right track now we needed something fresh and this is it new typing for old pokemon based on location heck yeah weve needed that for so long but theres a limit ya know but it makes it slightly realistic im so excited for the dancing birds i want all i will train them all and rotate them out so i only have at a time replaced gyms with trials yes this game is introducing actual differentiating cultures into the game and i like it i could go on but i think ill end my rant here im super hyped though i was only going to get one game but now i think ill get both ps im not sure how i feel about eggzecutor i totally mispelled that right but i guess this works for it it just seems a bit too tall but oh well
pokemon,removed,the führer approves
pokemon,removed,id like a darkrai code please
pokemon,removed,people can hate it if they want fuck off if you dont like other peoples opinions
pokemon,removed,oh yeah give me that clickbait title
pokemon,removed,rule politics just mentioned the trump hair and actually debunked the theory of it being that rpokemon mods have sticks somewhere
pokemon,removed,oh my arceus i laughed way to hard at this xdd
pokemon,removed,get that digitrash out of our pokecirclejerk
pokemon,removed,go to if youre on youll need browserhax and then install menuhax everything is detailed in the sticky though you cant play pirated games on so if youre into that you cant do that

pokemon,removed,can someone explain the dicks out for harambe thing i dont know if i saw it on imgur or reddit but the damn quote has been in my head for two days now and i keep shaking my head over it because it sounds stupid and i dont get it
pokemon,removed,to be honest i check the subreddit daily and a couple others check it weekly or every few days if you comment there chances are a dev will see it pretty quickly its just not that active of a subreddit the twitter is more for pr purposes and goes through fits and starts
pokemon,removed,my dick is out my brother my dick is out for harambe

pokemon,removed,pokenerds genwunner here what other fun combos are missing that people yearn for

pokemon,removed,ability meat shield i get it
pokemon,removed,you already linked the subreddit but my comment goes into more detail there are ostensibly supposed to be weekly update threads on vp board every sunday but since everybody is in crunch mode right now trying to wrap up the next demo and thats mostly playtesting and implementation rather then new content creation there hasnt been update threads made in the past few weeks since theres not really much new content to show theres the subreddit rpokemonsage that you can ask questions on but its not checked that often by the devs theres also a twitter httpstwittercompkmnsage but it was made after i stopped working on the project so i dont know how thats handled i know people are manning it though so im sure somebody will see it if you tweet at it also again while im not working on it anymore at least for now if you pm me with a question chances are i can get you an answer
pokemon,removed,dickisstilloutforharambe
pokemon,removed,they may take our harambes but they will never take out meat shields full charge forward
pokemon,removed,golurk is a golem an inanimate entity generally composed of earth or mud and made animate by the words carved into them hence golurk is a ground type because its a walking earthen entity
pokemon,removed,i actually think them memes have made people care more about what happened to our lord and saviour harambe
pokemon,removed,hidden ability bulletproof
pokemon,removed,too soon
pokemon,removed,why does no one miss bantu
pokemon,removed,golems are living mud or rock its semiappropriate that hes ground

pokemon,removed,d i c k s o u t
pokemon,removed,thank you for saying this there is probably a maximum of people that should be missing harambe the only people with a good reason to miss harambe are the zoo employees who personally worked with harambe anyone else who misses harambe is slightly pathetic and is dragging on a terrible situation
pokemon,removed,dixoutforharambe

pokemon,removed,just wait until theres a generation of pokemon based on nothing but various memes
pokemon,removed,harambes ability should be oh shit my dick out
pokemon,removed,wow those pokemon are well designed as hell
pokemon,removed,fun fact ghostfighting has universal coverage against every current type combo the only typing that resists it would be normalghost dual immunity in fact
pokemon,removed,its more than a meme to some of us fam
pokemon,removed,very dank maymay sir 😂
pokemon,removed,how dare you disrespect harambe look it up
pokemon,removed,is it sad that these designs are better than basically everything weve seen so far

pokemon,removed,rule incoming

pokemon,removed,dicks out
pokemon,removed,meat shield out for harambe
pokemon,removed,yeah no youre talking out of your ass type advantages arent as important in the anime and ash is fully aware of when hes at a disadvantage sometimes using it for his benefit hes used some very clever strategies against some really powerful gym leaders this gen even having to rematch a few once he worked something out hes more smarter and confident than hes ever been and rightfully earned his current spot at the kalos finals also hurr durr writers is such a copout excuse if you dont have any examples to show any of these broken rules happening
pokemon,removed,this is absolutely amazing
pokemon,removed,did you even know he existed before he was shot
pokemon,removed,digletsoutforharambe
pokemon,removed,dicksout
pokemon,removed,hidden ability does extra damage to baby pokemon such as elekid magby togepi etc
pokemon,removed,its just a meme chill
pokemon,removed,should of only been ghost for his second form
pokemon,removed,wait is this legit am i finally going to have the mega type combo ive always wanted
pokemon,removed,i liked teh meat shield part the lulz
pokemon,removed,is this real if not still looks real enough to be part of the game
pokemon,removed,theyre working on a demo that will go up to gym rpokemonsage

pokemon,removed,why can no pokemon other than mew learn surf fly and false swipe farfetchd fly and false swipe krabby kingler corphish crawdaunt surf and false swipe dragonite ducklett mew lugia pelliper latios latias rayquaza arcius fly and surf after looking at that list consider farfetchd duck should mean fly and surf because ducklett has fly and surf since they are both ducks farfetchd should be able to fly and surf just like ducklett now consider the leak sword carried by farfetchd that sword enables him to perform false swipe when compared to ducklett we have to ask why a leek sword would make it impossible for farfetchd to surf looking at all that information i think it reasonable to argue that farfetchd should be able to fly surf and false swipe ducks can fly and surf leek swords can false swipe so why would the designers refuse to allow farfetchd to surf or create another duckwithsword who can fly surf and false swipe i ask because i needwant a pokemon who can fly surf and false swipe for endgame the two main transport skills are fly and surf the main ability for catching pokemon is false swipe why would the developers deny me the convenience of one transport hm pokemon who can also carry false swipe hes a duck with a leek sword that is what should be what i want but for some reason the duck wont surf any reasons you can think of for why we do not have more fly surf false swipe pokemon
pokemon,removed,i know i am very late to the party does anyone still have any codes for mew

pokemon,removed,im not so sure you see as weve learned the games have an official timeline the last time we saw red and blue was in and theyve both visibly aged about years since this is not only evidenced by their appearances but through text and imagery that suggest anabell has aged significantly as well since emerald version also years now consider this we know hau and sunmoon to be years old throw in babymakin time and the possibility that hau didnt just turn and that adds up to years if the timeline has been progressing as ive suggested haus dad wouldnt have been in kanto as we played redgreen hed have been in alola breeding a perfect iv human chances are weve never even met haus dad also children dont have to be the same color as their parents you racist

pokemon,removed,mods mods never change
pokemon,removed,since people are getting easier access to iv training and whatnot its become the new way of showing off their epenor but mostly its aesthetics and people are pretty picky about how their pokemon look when theyre thrown out for the first few seconds of a battle

pokemon,removed,the word for something that looks starved is emaciated so tada emaciated is not a food definition whatever that means i have no idea what possessed me to double post clearly its beyond conception that it was a mistake or result of a bad internet connection
pokemon,removed,hey there cryptic alliance is a comic creating collab and one of our projects is an ongoing fan comic based in the pokemon universe its ridiculous its fun and major choices are decided by readers starters have already been chosen and were chapters in but anyone is welcome to join in the fun by visiting our website or if youre on the comic sharing site tapastic were there too if you want to catch up here are the links if it gets enough traction in the sub i could also post updates chapter by chapter and you all can vote here when votings live only if the mods are okay with that and if it actually gets viewedappreciated

pokemon,removed,ahh look his boyfriend to the rescue
pokemon,removed,cant fault the guy for not wanting to jeopardize his site again its not this nobody expects joe to update his site prior to release date but to spend the last two weeks crying about people playing the game early while he put up this facade of waiting until launch while he was blatantly writing up all the new stuff for the site is annoying he has been working on his site constantly for the last two weeks everyone knew what he was doing and yet he continued to cry about it joe playing victim is just annoying
pokemon,removed,my best guess is that the host is serving both pokemon and allheart and for some reason maybe due to a reboot or a bad failover the https pokemon servers ip is now hosting allheart and the dns servers have not been updated what that does not explain is why there are items in the shopping cart because that suggests cookies which suggests maninthemiddle theres even address info on the page jessica peters westholm rd niskayuna ny and theres a phone number maybe someone really just wants us to buy scrubs for them

pokemon,removed,fake and gay
pokemon,removed,im salty right now this comic is just annoying to read it can be put simpler i will make it simpler but still its only sarcasm better if new player read online guides your pokemon probably sucks if they are not legendaries or over used your pokemon sucks if they have weak stats your pokemon sucks if they dont have right ivs your pokemon sucks if they dont have right evs your pokemon sucks if they dont have right nature rest you must know is common specialphysical split and types advantage if you will hit pokemon with high defense with special attack it will get more damage and vice versa if you hit pokemon with high special defense with physical attack it will get more damage

pokemon,removed,actually soft resetting for a female pokemon thats the most autistic thing i have ever heard of do you also specifically ask your local pet shop for a female cat
pokemon,removed,its not a siren its a primarina a pokémon that is male and besides why do you care so much about the gender of your pokémon its literally just a symbol next to its name
pokemon,removed,i can say the same for you in wha world do you believe that you are correct in this situation your not but go ahead and give me some points and ill easily counter them fucktard

pokemon,removed,wwwpokemonshowdowncom its basically a website to test competitive teams and startegies online i have used it to experiment with a variety of pokemon that are more difficult to catch due to not having the gamenot having the patience to catch em all and train em allnot being able to trade the site makes it super easy to make any team you desire with any combination of moves and test them out worked for me to learn what the commonly used mons were and learn the various new moves as well oras was a good improvement over xy xy had always seemed unfinished to me you could try out the gens you missed out on emulators and get a feel for the new mons moves and abilities you missed out on
pokemon,removed,lmao fuck you
pokemon,removed,even if ganguro was derived from blackface it has nothing to do with whether or not jynx is racist its a positive fashion trend that gained popularity in contradiction to japanese standards of beauty light skin small lips black hair while blackface was used as a device in comedy for quickly identifying the stupid characters black dumb it seems american society has forgotten that intent is key to racism
pokemon,removed,i know that what i dont know is why someone is announcing it to the pokemon subreddit seven months after the deal was put into effect six months after preorders were first available and making sure to reference the everpopular twitch plays pokemon craze that happened more than two years ago it just smells a lot like a marketing ploy what do you think an amazon marketer trying to push prime subscriptions would have done differently than the op
pokemon,removed,lol that is just so incorrect its not even funny
pokemon,removed,implying that ash is not only gay but also an animal lover
pokemon,removed,also i never said anything about exeggutor i never said that alola was planned out for years i pointed out that this is a pattern of gfs style and because you suck at reading between lines youre trying to pass stuff off as ad hominem
pokemon,removed,also do you think this person is trying to convince people to spend on a prime membership to get off he said that this deal is an answer to our prayers in his topic title i dont know about you but ive certainly never prayed for a deal that i would lose money on and i dont see how this could possibly be answering anyones prayers if they dont do anything regarding it the only people who are actually getting anything useful out of this post i mean assuming it isnt trying to get people to buy amazon prime are people who already have amazon prime who should all be fully aware of this deal seeing as amazon has been shoving it down our collective throats since january did you think before you started writing why yes i did in fact i thought of all of the above things before i wrote my comment so did you think about those things before you wrote your post
pokemon,removed,this is probably a shitpost

pokemon,removed,anyone still giving codes
pokemon,removed,this still doesnt actually proof that oaks little autofillincoding was well done in any way just cause something was made for a purpose doesnt mean it is capable of fulfilling that purpose or atleast not in a satisfactory way again nothing in this description or even within the games themselves ever really say anything about the pokedexes being accurate

pokemon,removed,wt is a great way to clear up box space while still giving people the opportunity to have some nice breedjects generally what i do is trade out all of my breedjects at once visit the lotto corner then release all the junkmons sure its a pretty hefty time investment but you never know what youll get in ive gotten plenty of junk but also nearly boxes worth of breedjects that im using to build up my own projects ive also gotten at least one of the tapus and several exclusives i wouldnt have been able to get without trading anyway but if youre only looking for value rpokemontrades is probably more worth your time you can also just straight do a giveaway there to make sure they go to people who want them

pokemon,removed,not trying to hate on all of this cuteness but im going to assume the health problems are digestive system related due to her very restricted diet but fruit very high in fiber and fodmaps also having a skin and seeds to consume could potentially be a bad thing for those with ibds among other intolerances that all being said amazing choice over real cake

pokemon,removed,you dont need to calculate the odds of perfect ivs why tf would you waste time learning that you get higher mons you put it in if youre looking for hidden power you check the ivs youre making it sound like this is rocket science and its not everything youre saying you have knowledge of takes me less than five minutes to google the odds of ability inheritance youve gotta be joking thats the dumbest thing ive ever heard

pokemon,removed,i dont like this i love the anime but the dude literally hasnt kept with the anime for years and suddenly decides to jump back in the anime is good at points but ehthose dynamic battles get unnecessary after a while the battles still arent exciting like they used to be when i was a kid some of the filler is still hard to sit through the evil team is still getting an arc after the main story is over which i find to be stupid they did this with black and white and it was terrible i think its mainly getting hyped up since zygarde and ashgreninja are concepts that may be in sun and moon which means the anime got the content first

pokemon,removed,i dont get tattoos theres very rarely a case for them in my opinion if there is something important to you you dont need do irreversibly plaster it all over your skin its ugly looking and stupid even i lost interest or it did go belly up it wouldnt change what the games meant to me as a kid and what would your opinion as a child matter if when older you have unfavourable feelings towards the franchise you cant just take it off i mean seriously just wear a tshirt occasionally or something so many ways of expressing something you like without having it look tacky or irreversible
pokemon,removed,might see if you can get one of the moderators to add you to the httpswwwredditcomrpokemonwikirelatedsubreddits from the sidebar not sure what the official process is for getting added there but you could start be messaging the moderators
pokemon,removed,can i have one of these i can get arceus card in my country
pokemon,removed,it wont install for some reason im running on windows and it just tells me that windows smart screen has stopped it from running because its potentially dangerous i doubt its dangerous and i have antivirus so how can i tell windows smart screen to kindly fuck off
pokemon,removed,yet another main game elitist post is it really so bad that your friends like pokemon go and its getting them interested in the series again also the early pokemon jokes are still hilarious i dont know why youre hating on backwards muk

pokemon,removed,only a shit player would think theres no skill you must really suck at battling
pokemon,removed,people always want to talk about leaks but apparently the sub has rules against them so they must be deleted you think the mods would stop blindly following rules and actually look before they enforce

pokemon,removed,reeee
pokemon,removed,most people wont be salty at all for most if they have a cfw they know how to bypass a ban or at least they should even then more than likely its going to be a day ban a stern reminder that we shouldnt break da rules but a manageable punishment none the less plus someone like me i have multiple so i can jump to another one anyway if i really wanted to go online plus when my retail cart actually comes in i can just transfer my save to an actual cart wait out the timeout and be back to business as usual literally no salt is going to be generated

pokemon,removed,how about you go fuck yourself
pokemon,removed,yeah same what do the qr codes do
pokemon,removed,holy shit youre a dick
pokemon,removed,well luckly i used an emulator
pokemon,removed,depending on your hack a ban means nothing example i got a on sysnand but it boots into my various sd cards which in turn are emunand so basically when i play my nintendo servers think i am on the latest firmware if they ban me then i can just back up the games and save on that sd card and format it again and voila everything is back to normal i played the leak version and went to the pokeplaza thing which is local play but i did press a button to connect to the internet but then after it connected i disconnected lets see now when i get home ill boot it up and see if i got the good ole ban hammer
pokemon,removed,the only reason you have a problem with it is because you knew it existed before you played the game if the game hadnt been leaked and people had made guides on day you would be here whining about how the internet ruins the discovery of finding things in a game by yourself so suck it up and stop whining
pokemon,removed,i agree they shouldnt have downloaded it in the first place and it only hurts nintendo
pokemon,removed,fuck you man the fuck up and read dont expect others to bow to your ignorance
pokemon,removed,sonow we know why the anime always was a irredemable messthe creator was a edgelord who never grew mentally past
pokemon,removed,were the only ones that matter right now our house is on fire and will likely stay that way for four years
pokemon,removed,they could also just bypass the nnidconsole ban if they didnt want all the games they previously legitimately paid for to go away it would require the forethought to play sumo online on a throwaway nnid or not play online at all before the release date before using this method to get their online connectivity back also they could just get the games they lost from the banhammer back using a certain homebrew app that tricks the systemservice into letting them download the game straight from the cdn sorry for all those folks with raging justice boners but this ban did nothing

pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,i get that measures should be taken to punish piracy but this seems pretty harsh to me particularly because of the way the poor way their store is set up if for whatever reason they had bought a number of games digitally and didnt have them currently installed they no longer have access to potentially hundreds of dollars of legitimately bought and paid for games
pokemon,removed,jesus people its called wait until launch day to use the online features how did you think you wouldnt get banned sure you have freeshop but now you cant do anything with other people unless its local wireless nice job

pokemon,removed,dave joke
pokemon,removed,these friars were behind on their belfry payments so they opened up a small florist shop to raise funds since everyone liked to buy flowers from the men of god a rival florist across town thought the competition was unfair he asked the good fathers to close down but they would not he went back and begged the friars to close they ignored him so the rival florist hired hugh mactaggart the roughest and most vicious thug in town to persuade them to close hugh beat up the friars and trashed their store saying hed be back if they didnt close up shop terrified they did so thereby proving that hugh and only hugh can prevent florist friars

pokemon,removed,yes they do i suspect its due the throngs of goldfish nintendo fanboys and hopeless xbox devotees
pokemon,removed,yeah alchemy sure is interesting personally i dont watch anime i study facts you realize that alchemy was believed to be a real thing right like in a way it was basically a precursor to modern science so its perfectly real just as history rather than science also its cool that you have your own ideas but go write your own posts instead of complaining on other peoples plus who cares if there are similar theories floating around people are going to draw similar conclusions from the same material and if everyone checked to make sure no one had done it first no one would post anything
pokemon,removed,then delete the fucking thread and repost it properly you saying a mistake doesnt make this kind of post all of a sudden okay this is a shit post with a click bait title
pokemon,removed,just manually sort them you lazy git
pokemon,removed,he goes into a little more detail in his on what his proposed reboot could potentially entail
pokemon,removed,well id be saying maybe a story that the young adults who used to be fans and the children could enjoy also the gameplay is kind of getting stale lockstin recently did a video explaining why and id suggest checking it out for a better explanation
pokemon,removed,looking for mew code or arceus code if anyone has one they arent using it would be greatly appreciated

pokemon,removed,the title is clickbait but the theory itself is entirely factlogic based seriously worth a watch
pokemon,removed,some people like to selfidentify with their character by having as much in common with them as possible which is why the addition of a female player character was important in crystal and the addition of player characters of colour was important in x and y but some players who selfidentify as male have to chose between such selfidentification and their characters wearing dresses so long as male player characters cant wear them and it would be nice if they didnt have to make that choice especially as players who selfidentify as female can have both
pokemon,removed,ignore the green tint i really dont know what hes doing with that he does bring up some good points though

pokemon,removed,roms are illegal under some circumstances roms stand for read only memory so they are just the game ported onto a file from an actual cartage if you have a physical copy of the game im not sure about digital downloads it is completely legal to download a rom and play it through an emulator but if you dont have a physical copy of the game then it is considered as piracy this also goes for movies music etc tldr if you have a game irl then you can download a rom of it

pokemon,removed,is there someway to hack pokes that dont require any hardware you need to buy for games i wish to prepare some pokes for a team i wish to try out once the pokebank is up
pokemon,removed,no they dont not in this context its a process called genericiziation and how it works is if the brand becomes so well known and widespread people use it as a synonym for what the type of product the brand represents for example if nintendo as word stopped beingused to refer to nintendo consoles by the public but instead as a generic term for all video game consoles or if pokemon wasnt just used by the general public to refer to pokemon games but any monster collecting games following that allowing fangames to use pokemon in their title doesnt risk genericization because those are still pokemon fangames not fangames featuring monster collecting aspectsthat arent pokemon but still using the brand name and even if it were there is virtually zero risk of it happening because pokemon is a massive international franchise that is immedately recognizable to billions of people its ludicrious to imply that fangames being let go that nobody outside of the hardcore fanbase know exists would lead to genericization people need to stop spreading this to defend this sort of thing its just factually incorrect
pokemon,removed,where can i find some good quality pokemon emulators for pc that wont give me a virus
pokemon,removed,no it fucking isnt its a hack of a pokemon rom that was definitely illegally downloaded that used nintendos ip then the creator decided to release a trailer for it too that would be like installing a mod into fallout then distributing it as a new game called jumpin
pokemon,removed,tbh they had it coming they were pretty stupid for broadcasting it like that also spending years working on a rom hack seems like a total waste to me but what do i know im just some jackass on the internet

pokemon,removed,where you getting your translation all the sites ive been to none of them say exclusive and why would coro coro go explain his evolution as day and night than next page say its exclusive it makes no sense
pokemon,removed,since you didnt specify on blood amount i am going to assume a paper cut will suffice and since i am innocent i got one of those down so far on a serious note if you dont mind could you tell me how you made those or is it a trade secret
pokemon,removed,oh fuck you are a loser haha
pokemon,removed,all it says is it shows midday form being obtained in sun and night in moon which would make sense since most ppl play during the day so moon would be night so evolving him would make him night form but where does it say exclusive
pokemon,removed,does it say only you missing key words here only obtained in sun or only obtained in moon than you have an argument all it says is hey look his day form obtained in sun it couldve said his day form obtained in moon and still meant it wasnt exclusive stop reaching

pokemon,removed,is the picture just there for karma whatever as long as what youre doing doesnt effect other players like hacking a pokemon with of all stats or teaching them impossible moves or impossible abilities like wondertomb then its fine people just get salty that they have to put in a bunch of work to ev train and iv breed their pokemon while others just press a button most hacks involved some sort of money an sd card a cable paying a hacker a dollar so the trade is you get it all free but they get it fast some people dont have any time to ev train or iv breed they have jobs or other games they want to play without devoting hours to pokemon some people dont get any enjoyment out of it either and forcing them to do it the natural way doesnt solve anything it just bores them and turns them off from the game and makes people rather go play showdown personally if i have access to the pokemon i will breed and ev train it myself but in some cases if i want something thats hard to get like a competitive shiny chesnaught because i vastly prefer his colors to normal chesnaught because they match chespins color scheme ill ask someone to make one for me just because getting all of those stars to align irl would take forever shiny with proper ivsabilityetc

pokemon,removed,came here to say this haha
pokemon,removed,at the end of the day this game is aimed at and played by many children and gamers without many social skills or a sense of proportion in their life which is why there is a surprising number of people who defend ivs even though ivs are objectively the worst mechanic in the main series pokemon games any normal person with a proportional sense of logic knows that ivs add only negative value to the games and do not serve any purpose that adds constructive complexity to the games ivs are the definition of complexity for complexitys sake gamefreak has slowly been moving away from its original philosophy on ivs and has almost tossed it out the window with xy when they made it super easy still only really for longtime players to get pokemon with maximum potential i would not be surprised if in sunmoon they further go against their initial philosophy by either removing them completely or making it possible to increasedecrease ivs using some sort of new system
pokemon,removed,its really cool but that doesnt mean it wont be removed for breaking rule and rule
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,if not could someone tell me who the creator of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,lol watch the
pokemon,removed,as many have said i cant agree with this considering how laughably easy it is to get perfect ivs at this point also ivs also affect lots of strategy like hidden powers or trick room and to anyone saying just add another stat for hidden power thats dumb youre removing one variable and adding another giant waste of time see competitive pokémon is just a part of pokémon as a whole and the ticket to enter is understanding how to manipulate stats aka ivs dont want to do that the answer is dont play competitive simple as that also mods should really do somethign about this kind of posts this is like the or one this month tldr git gud

pokemon,removed,whaaaaaaaaaaaaa how the fuck did i not know that existed thank you
pokemon,removed,he acts like cheating in a pokemon is comitting a murder and attacks people for no reason along with deleting any comments he finds to be against his point of view
pokemon,removed,hes an ass to other poketubers and does anything to het views
pokemon,removed,try disagreeing with him on twitter even over the smallest thing and he will block you thats just one thing he said a while ago that smogen was the reason he lost his girlfriend and as of late he claims that hyper training will a bring in more casual players and that more players is a bad thing b make breeding for pokemon pointless due to not needing to breed for perfect ivs anymore and never mind that natures and egg moves are a thing c does nothing to stop cheaters that gen in those perfect iv pokemon even though it was simply a way to give your average player a way to get these types of pokemon without having to go through the monotony of having to rely on the random number generator while trying to breed them ok im done

pokemon,removed,i am using a samsung galaxy right now to play pokemon go you just have to do some work arounds to get it to work first you install it by downloading the apk then when you run it for the first time you while get a blank green screen after you hit okay on the watch where you are going message if you click around the bottom of the screen hit no when a message asks if you want to quit then click a little above where you clicked before and it should start up
pokemon,removed,you have google no one on here should be explaining how to torrent because its against the rules mate go out and buy it if you want a copy
pokemon,removed,trump
pokemon,removed,the thing is though a lot of news websites and gaming websites that have large base followings also posted how to access the apk or how to switch you ios to the zone that was open id love to see the real stats of how many people outside of the zone actually downloaded the game in the span before the official release i think they got rushed to release in the us to appease some people due to high demand even though most people werent patient to begin with i wouldnt be surprised if in that zone there were of thousands or even of thousands of downloads and log ins extra than what niantic was expecting i may be wrong but seems the issues started coming up after people found how to circumvent the zoning download issue mostly early est time yesterday
pokemon,removed,eu guy here doing apk stuff to get pokemon to my seems like the pokemon varies with time if not daynight most of my findings are pidgeys ghastly nidoranfm spearow weedle and caterpie strangely enough i passed though one of these an hour ago

pokemon,removed,speculation posts with nothing to run off of other than a comment that a game will be released for the system breaks rule theres nothing to actually discuss its basically just an ideas thread because we have zero information on the games themselves so theres nothing for us to actually talk about beyond ideashopes for them also making threads to tell people to stop deleting threads doesnt actually help the situation

pokemon,removed,personally i just pick six pokémon that are at least usable and try not to repeat types it makes the games more fun to not have an answer to everything sometimes that means not having flawless type coverage which can include a lack of an ice type move also garchomps ground moves can ohko empoleon so ice beam on it may not be your best bet and your whitney team building point is dumb its perfectly reasonable to have an only member team wo any pokémon that resist rock type at that point in the game

pokemon,removed,this post gives me violent diarrhea
pokemon,removed,if you can only catch a starter because there are no pokéstops and wild pokémon nearby i fear i have to dissapoint you im in germany and downloaded the apk and everything is fully functional even before the official release besides the server issues so i doubt anything will change for you when the game is officially released

pokemon,removed,hey kiddo look i know youre being all aggressive and whiteknighty but made up statistic of us dont care remotely about what youve said because meganium looks wimpy compared to every other fully evolved starter and tons of people dismiss it for that alone get it now
pokemon,removed,the comment i first replied said im tired of people overlooking the chikorita line and saying its a terrible starter and i replied by stating that chikorita and its evolutionary line are competitively one of the worst starters because thats what i assume he was referring to your comment has nothing to do to with what i said chikorita and its evos are well liked amongst the fans but everyone knows they suck because competitively they have much more useful alternatives ps shove your condescending attitude up your ass

pokemon,removed,triggered
pokemon,removed,i submitted this in rpokemonromhacks and didnt get anything back ok so i downloaded the correct vba emulator once that was downloaded i put it into a folder on my desktop called vba i also downloaded the randomizer by following the directions off i must have that randomizer because there are a lot of tradeevolved pokemon that i want so in the vba folder i have the vba emulator the romfire red and the randomizer i right click the rom and use winrar to unzip it so that i can load it up into the randomizer one thing i dont understand is how do i know that the pokemon game im playing has been correctly randomized im pretty sure the file thats been randomized is the gba file because its the only thing that i can drag onto the vba screen also whenever i save the game whether i do a quick save or a save as and give my saved game a name the saved files are all different in fact even when i close out without saving it creates a new file in the folder some are and sgm files and i also noticed that when i drag the gba file onto the vba screen to start the game up a saved game comes up instead of the game intro so somehow i accidently saved over the actual game file that i drag onto the vba screen so now i cant even start a new game after playing around with all this for a while i had like different files in my pokemon fire red folder which is in my vba folder and have no idea which i need and which one has been successfully randomized so i can get trade evolved pokemon i know these are pretty simple questions but my computer skills are fairly weak i really appreciate the help im just so confused on how to organize all these random files if i have done something incorrectly please let me know cheers

pokemon,removed,rpokemongo mods are dicks and dont like anything im glad im not interested in pokemon go so i dont have to deal with them anymore
pokemon,removed,vp
pokemon,removed,the mods in rpokemongo have a stick up their ass its really sad like as soon as the subreddit was at the peak of popularity they had the bright idea to just ban screenshots
pokemon,removed,wow whoever decided that it was a good idea to name the last species that they where not very senseitive
pokemon,removed,i agree with him on cheating i really dont like it at all and it doesnt take much work to breed but the clickbait of his video is just ugh
pokemon,removed,part
pokemon,removed,i only watch his videos for builds on different competitive pokemon now they still provide different outlooks on each pokemon and a different view then the one or two builds on smogon articles however pretty much any other video he posts is garbage its usually a minute rant on how something is busted or broken when it usually isnt or about startingcontinuing drama between people in vgcsmogon i tried watching a video he posted about hyper training and he spent the whole thing talking about how it was garbage and how he was right and everyone who disagreed with him in the past was stupid and how now vgc is just going to be filled with hacked pokemon blah blah blah i may be playing a childrens video game but it doesnt mean i want to listen to a grown man act like a child about it
pokemon,removed,also hes a furry wtf does this even have to do with anything
pokemon,removed,dont link that shit scum clickbait youtuber doesnt deserve the money
pokemon,removed,hes like the sjw of the pokemon fandom i think i dont particularly hate him but i do think that some of his suggested sets are kinda dumb sometimes but so are smogons and for being the great trainer he claims to be he seems rather oblivious at times the thing about the guy is how he is quite vocal about cheating personally i dont do it and dont like people doing it like i dont like people skipping the line in the subway or in the bank but mostly i dont give a damn and just roll with the tide this guy on the other side begins to call out people and insult them on his channel although bear in mind that its childish to complain about it when the other parties do exactly the same think of him as megyn kelly in the news she loves to point fingers at the douches of the world but deep down shes the same kind of scum
pokemon,removed,actually you can do we the fuck you want to the tos dont give shit and neither does nintendo if it isnt blaring obvious hacks then you can use basically any pokemonmovesivnature combination even if they cant be legally obtained
pokemon,removed,so my post was removed because of i hate to be rude but why exactly i barely post here but i read the rules and i dont understand what i did wrong also i have to admit that this is one of the things that is hugely annoying about reddit in general every subreddit has really specific heavily enforced rules and i really dont get why it has to be so heavyhanded i mean if someone is just trying to share a photo or something they find interesting with other people then why should it be so difficult maybe i should just go back to lurking or quit posting on reddit altogether
pokemon,removed,you said minor spoilers but its actually major spoilers

pokemon,removed,i post in a mod rage thread and am still ignored at least the mods at rpokemontrades reapproved my thread even though i didnt have the appropriate flair to post about info then they even processed my flair upgrade even quicker this was within minutes i havent heard from rpokemon mods at all and it has been over an hour why did i even bother posting in this subreddit will the mods ever get back to me where even is my post how does reddit even work
pokemon,removed,this community hates hacking and they hate it because they need to feel validated for all the time theyve put in when in reality it shouldnt matter as long as the pokémon is legal it really shouldnt bother them but then again this is a community that gets butt hurt because a starter would stand on two legs instead of four but if hacking was accepted then all the thousands of hours theyve put in would have gone to waste to them but they shouldnt really even think like that either because its just a game all that matters is if youre having fun and for a lot of people using action replay is fun its just a video game
pokemon,removed,why didnt this get tagged spoilers please why cmon i dont have that much time on my hands im still doing the story why god why not cool dude not cool dont mods check for this stuff
pokemon,removed,does it give a competitive advantage no ok then shut the fuck up and play the fucking game and stop distracting people whining about hacking is the most annoying thing a poekmon player can do yall are worse than genwunners especially yall that use guides and help to breed pokemon with the right moves or breed for ivs or to get the right evs how about we just ban everyone that will solve this thing that is not a problem in the first place since hacked pokemon doesnt give a competitive advantage a ball type doesnt make you win the match
pokemon,removed,its ok guys you can say it we all know male swimmers put their pokeballs in their assholes and females in their vaginas
pokemon,removed,hi ive trying to play the game for awhile unfortunately i dont have the money to invest in a nintendo ive downloaded the rom in pirate bay but cant run it in citra ive the latest build available smoothly only with fps ive a nvidia any thoughts on how to improve it
pokemon,removed,the advantage is not putting in the effort and work to obtain said mons to use look you genning because everyone else is genning is wildly similar to the baseball steroid era if we had a venue where no one was genning pokemon you wouldnt be forced to gen yourself or simply not take part in these events because you dont want to gen so really you just admitted that people who gen pokemon ruined the game by creating this atmosphere where you should gen to get a good chance to stay in competition or simply not take partget destroyed it has nothing to do with back in my day rant as opposed to what it actually is bunch of people excusing a method of cheating because it makes it easier this would be like baseball players today with the rules established that they cannot cheat by using roids in pokemon it is clearly stated its illegal use genned pokemon or even breed with genned pokemon getting caught for using steroids and complaining about how theres no harm theres no harm because the environment has already been ruined by genning and hackers no hackers no environment no need to feel like you are at a disadvantage without genning no need for cheating the problem here is that hackers and genners are getting away with too much no one cares if you hack your own game and dont take part in events and tourneys the back in my day attitude you mistook me for is simply that theres way too many people these days who want everything given to them and believe they are entitled to it at the push of a button you see no problem because youre among the biased users who use it to level the playing field for yourself with no effort put in im not criticizing just you im criticizing the act of hacking again nintendo and gamefreak adamantly states that genning and hacking is not allowed and you are immediately pending disqualification as well as no credibility in these kinds of events even bred offspring of genned poke is illegal the problem here is players like you and officiators not competent enough to recognize an immediate red flag just about any intermediate player can catch bb porygon now do i believe porygon being in bb is game breaking no but its not the physical existence of porygon in bb thats the problem its the act of genning and hacking especially in tourneys and pro scene again as stated i dont care if you do that on your own game with no regards to using them in professional matches or competitive matches

pokemon,removed,i can appreciate a good reference this isnt one making a reference to anything regarding that incident on rnews isnt funny or cute stop
pokemon,removed,i think we just got hacked
pokemon,removed,this is probably just a hack of the account that made this post just ignore it and wait for the normal mods to get on and fix it
pokemon,removed,ok either op is upset about what happened back in rnews or he got hacked i dont personally know the dude well enough so i cant say which is correct if either is correct at all
pokemon,removed,could you say youre routoftheomloop
pokemon,removed,this is what happens when you give all your moderators full permission httpswwwredditcomrpokemonaboutmoderators check the other subreddits that op moderates all the same shit
pokemon,removed,dear wow not only are your ideas old recycled and shitty but you are an asshole to boot its not nice to tell people who are critical of your ideas to kill themselves what would prof oak think how do we vote for a new mod
pokemon,removed,youll be gone in about three hours good riddance
pokemon,removed,what the heck
pokemon,removed,glad for you to get unmodded just look at this dudes comment history hes saying some really terrible things
pokemon,removed,so how come you snapped clearly youve lost your mind
pokemon,removed,i got it
pokemon,removed,saved it
pokemon,removed,nice of you to delete the previous thread in which you stated youre glad faggots are dead youre a good one
pokemon,removed,im assuming this is why the subreddit is a strange css and is awful to look at
pokemon,removed,no thank you and goodbye i prefer my pokemon without year old yodelers
pokemon,removed,no witch hunting please our quarry is not with him as a person but him as a moderator
pokemon,removed,that was straight up ridiculous
pokemon,removed,apparently one of the lower mods got hacked and went on a rampage changed the css talked about how he was glad faggots are dead and started banning people he made sticky posts about how this subreddit is going to change
pokemon,removed,httpimgurcomanlqbm this he claims he was hacked then he said when someone told him there was no way he was hacked dunno what a sept is
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,doing this header background urlbanner norepeat top center height headerbottomleft position absolute bottom but it would mean having the default tabmenu design not your custom black one you would need to offset the your banner by pixels first though like httpiimgurcommdqhlrjpng probably wont help but i though i should post this anyway apologies
pokemon,removed,was targeted by users
pokemon,removed,kind of a shot in the dark here but try removing the default reddit logo from the banner like this headerimgdefaultheader display none header height
pokemon,removed,it seems like theres multiple rules for header tabmenu aka the menu line one rule correctly sets the top property to but a later rule says the element should be set to top instead httpiimgurcomeduyybtpng the same applies to the headerbottomright element containing the user infor or click here to login area a rule setting the top property to is overridden by one setting it to instead the reddit logo can presumably be hidden using display none however to get back to the right of the menu you might need to insert it manually again im not familiar with what options you have in the backend as a mod but it was not inserted as a background image on the headerimg element but rather as a plain image img
pokemon,removed,darn it you fixed the position as i was gonna post the fix blargh either way the hex for the bar is
pokemon,removed,does anyone still have a code available
pokemon,removed,i really want to give a sarcastic answer but is there a chance we could attempt to reload the banner image and correct it all
pokemon,removed,seems like some user didnt like him and we were just part of them messing around in his account
pokemon,removed,tame rpokeporn
pokemon,removed,fair enough thanks for clarifying
pokemon,removed,i know how it all happened i was on and an anon on b posted a hack thread
pokemon,removed,actually someone on b posted a hack thread
pokemon,removed,so am i but at least i make the goddamn effort to not have my grammar and spelling reach shitpost territory
pokemon,removed,stupid rules ill send a pm with the shop
pokemon,removed,thank you the originals are only inches in size so large format canvas wouldnt probably work lol i do have an etsy where i sell and prints though im just not allowed to link to it here on the subreddit because it breaks the no self advertising rule i can pm you the link to my etsy if you like though
pokemon,removed,thank you c i have an etsy where i have put up prints for the gilded eeveelutions i can send you a pm with the link to my etsy since its against the subreddit rules to self advertise
pokemon,removed,friend code exchange i have a dark safari
pokemon,removed,hello fellow pokemon masters i am in need of help i am trying to complete the national dex in oras i only have technically pokemon left im looking for someone to trade me the pokemon i need which i will return to you immediately just so i can fill the national dex so i can get the shiny charm i need to evolve two clampearl so i can get gorebyss and huntail i need to obtain milotic kyogre groudon latios jirachi nosepass and possibly trade seedot for keeps i need the whole seedot evolutions family i will trade back right away please halp fc shoot me a message on here ill more than likely be online aswell
pokemon,removed,also a note to mods about a low effort post i posted a screenshot because the video is very long many hours pikachu does not appear anywhere but team preview so i decided just to post a screenshot of it the video is linked right below in the comments section its relevant to the official competitive scene
pokemon,removed,no shinies allowed here im afraid head over to rshinypokemon and show off your lovely shiny
pokemon,removed,to be fair it is a rule rule its a stupid rule though
pokemon,removed,can i have one if you still have a code to give
pokemon,removed,questions how do i play pokemon on the pc and what pokemon game playable on the pc is going to give me the most replayabilitylast the longest as in grinding out certain pokemon etc
pokemon,removed,httpskissanimetoanimeonepunchman
pokemon,removed,i have na darkrai codes trading them for diancie and hoopa if anyone is interested pm me
pokemon,removed,i have a darkrai you can have
pokemon,removed,im ready
pokemon,removed,please dont be a dick i find him incredibly handsome if you dont you can just keep your comments to yourself people can still be gorgeous even if they dont fit in your personal boxes of what you consider attractive beauty isnt a checklist of ▫️tall ▫️buff ▫️chiseled jaw ect and many of his features are what is considered conventionally attractive anyway hes got beautiful honey auburn hair ridiculously cute freckles full lips muscular legs and shoulders the list goes on and on no one is going to be perfect in every aspect and the sooner you accept that the better i wouldnt change a single thing about him
pokemon,removed,sorry if the image seems a bit glitched in the thumbnail i hope to the buddha to allah to god and hundreds of other beings that may be passing by that this little one will eventually become reality

pokemon,removed,thanks for being so sweet and not explaining why
pokemon,removed,you probably already knew that though
pokemon,removed,pokemon is for kids this post has been reported
pokemon,removed,reposting is against the rules
pokemon,removed,whats that you all thought japanese writers had any fucking clue how to write a good story with a meaningful payoff ending you should watch more anime no offense to anime writers but theyre all pretty fucking shit at writing a consistent story what a fucking load of shit i hope the backlash worldwide slaps the producers and the pokemon company across the face but it wont because not enough people care about the anime
pokemon,removed,spoiler ashe lost in the finals to a mega charizard
pokemon,removed,kissanime is pretty good site it has subs that are very well done and the quality is good too i believe it has dp bw and the xy series subbed not sure about kantohoenn though

pokemon,removed,its bothering me a little bit that the guy is spamming literally spamming reddits definition of spam is about of what hes doing and getting away with it ive seen people who create good varied content banned from the entire site for much less than this
pokemon,removed,ever think to fucking read up on them vulpix lives in the mountains where its cold and using new pokemon is the most fun thing about a new pokemon game if youre just gonna use gen pokemon then go buy frlg
pokemon,removed,waited years hoping ash would win just one league without getting cucked but nope i had just about enough of this writing bullshit
pokemon,removed,widespread positive public reception for the pokémon go i thought the overall reception was more mixed given how much people tend to complain about bugs server problems and lack of communication from niantic
pokemon,removed,must be a glitch release it
pokemon,removed,that rasen shuriken got me fucking hard but writers are fucking kidding me really nigguh
pokemon,removed,wow okay then look i never once said you shouldnt hope for a new game the bit about hdmi not insulting your intelligence simply explaining how to set up a computer on a tv not even directly to you other people read too if your friends wont buy a and pokemon why would they buy an nx and stadium unless of course y mean they just use your system and game in which case my example still applies they wouldnt be setting up any janky shit you would since they would be playing at your house plus since in your words hdmi is pretty basic knowledge your friends shouldnt have any trouble setting my example up so if they dont know about competitive and dont care about pokemon enough to buy a main game how much fun are they going to really have battling in a new stadium game i know that most of my non competitive friends would rather pick moves and abilities for pokemon rather than just rent a team garbage move sets no customization is no good and if your friends hate team building they probably dont really like playing pokemon you dont have to tweak evs and ivs in showdown if you dont want to theres presets like special sweeper the point is having both options is nice yes there is mini games but that isnt going to hold the average persons attention for very long unless they are under or drunk the sheer amount of people on showdown shows that many people play it for fun not just team testing plus it connects to other people faster than anything nintendo has ever made you get in battle get out its quick and efficient and finally my post did have basis i was explaining how to simulate a console game with an internet browser and some smart phones your post however consisted of hurrdurr there is no showdown for consoles no shit youre op of this thread you should be kind and courteous to the people who take the time to post in your thread not a douche who stifles discussion and its not like im against your idea id love a new stadium but the fact is if showdown is too complex and and main pokemon games arent worth your friends time they wont play a new stadium game

pokemon,removed,how can i inject a valid serial in a notsolegal pokémon black rom in order to export pokémon from a flashcart gold to pokémon bank without having my banned aside from that is there a way to know whether a roms serial is banned
pokemon,removed,theres no way to really know for sure but to put it in perspective ive been breeding competitive pokemon for many years in the literal tens of thousands of eggs hatched just last week i finally hatched my first shiny pokemon with the correct it needs for competitive play most competitive pokemon only require of the specific ivs i would never give that away to give away a pokemon which is even rarer thats ridiculous however generating a shiny pokemon thats a cakewalk

pokemon,removed,have you seen what butterflies evolve out of seriously caterpillars rarely look that much like their evolved forms and venonat does evolve into a venomoth which it shares more similarities with than butterfree
pokemon,removed,they created it so they know what theyre doing is one of the stupidest things ive ever heard do you know how many companies and developers make shitty products or media that doesnt follow its own established rules or lore they can fuck it up even if they made it
pokemon,removed,lol you truly think the developers are just heartless monsters or something im sure they put a lot of thought into each pokemon theres a lore and design choice for everything they do there are over pokemon and each one is unique and has a story behind it so you cant say they just dont think about these things cause they clearly thought about it way more than any of us did also if youre gunna hold them to a mistake they made in their first game then im surprised you made it this far yea it does make sense for venonat to evolve into butterfree and i even read somewhere it was a programming mistake but to say that the developers put no care into anything because of venonat is pretty ignorant
pokemon,removed,pokémon deva dont know what theyre doing proceeds to give example from years ago

pokemon,removed,it wouldnt be ethically justifiable to kill and eat them regardless of their type and yet they still eat oddish salad and tauros steak anyway probably because ethics are subjective its actually really interesting when you think about it pokemon have shown themselves to have humanlevel intelligence and choose to battle or allow themselves to be killed for food theyre obviously capable of uniting and revolting if they really wanted to think about it an army of raichus charizards and baltsoises itd be one sided af they arent realworld cattle that are too dumb to figure out how a fence works in short vegans are the team plasma of the real world
pokemon,removed,nice ad hominem insulting people in an argument gets you nowhere in winning it
pokemon,removed,vegan pancake are the main ingredients resentment and regret
pokemon,removed,harming animals we have no right to use except for the fact that we are at the top or really close to the top of the food chain we have every right to use animals that are lower than us and are gonna die anyway if you dont agree with killing thats fine but at least natural deathroadkill that you hit and byproducts like nonfertilized eggs should be fair game because no animal is killed on purpose for those

pokemon,removed,holy shit what changed with the anime sorry im so behind but i just stumbled upon a youtube video of pokemon xyz episode and motherfuck what happened the last time i watched any part of the show was i think min of black and white on accident and it was total trash i stopped watching around johto because i felt like id outgrown it and the animation plot character development everything seemed to start spiraling downward ive only caught clips of however many seasons have been in between since like or i think but this is totally different ive always felt like pokemon was kind of weak in anime and its tv popularity played a lot on nostalgia but this whole episode felt like a completely different show in the best way possible whats going on with the animation this is incredible quality and the music and everything what changed i dont even know where to start
pokemon,removed,yeah much better than wasting my life making shitty clay models and getting nothing back for it

pokemon,removed,i prefer an egg batter myself i dont use enough milk to ever have it on hand butter is expensive margerine is the butter of choice for poor students im definitely neither a vegan nor vegetarian but if you look at my diet some days its hard to tell theres more overlap in cooking than one might expect im planning on buying meat more that i know is cruelty free when i can afford to care as ive found nothing has the same lasting power to calorie ratio as jerky i know how to make that and im also a fermentation adept sauerkraut d and i really need to lose some weight

pokemon,removed,i have uk codes but i have a na anybody want them for a na code
pokemon,removed,really you hold off for days or weeks on playing a new game just to have a pokemon with a different color autistic as hell
pokemon,removed,but thats not postgame thats pregame like breeding for one after youre done with the new game i can sort of maybe understand still a pathetic unproductive waste of time though but actually not playing the game until you have your differently colored pokemon that you hunted repeatedly did a tedious menial task thats turboautism behavior analysts could make huge leaps in the field of autism studies by observing you as a specimen
pokemon,removed,im not losing my shit im just calling you an autist for partaking in an autistic activity im not sure i understand tendies im not familiar with reddit lingo
pokemon,removed,what is there youre not deriving enjoyment from the process youre wasting your time going through a tedious task holding off on playing the game for days on end and burning dozens of hours for a differently colored video game character thats the embodiment of autism thats like the ritual to summon the ancient gods of autism from another realm
pokemon,removed,i already hate my country enough over brexit dont do this to me bro
pokemon,removed,i dont like corporation trying to manipulate my behavior while im browsing reddit
pokemon,removed,do it yourself begger

pokemon,removed,triggered
pokemon,removed,pp
pokemon,removed,because it was confirmed try using google before getting so triggered
pokemon,removed,no its not hating people that watch anything other than the original i dont watch the anime i get no hate the hate comes from when people begin declaring that everything new sucks before you go on i am not saying this is what you are doing feeling the need to let everyone know you have no idea what something is and that you had to google it comes off as that kind of behavior asking a question about something you dont know is not an issue you are not invested in pokemon okay whatever but what makes you think that a teacher who has been stated as loving pokemon would not know what a driftloon is like you again comes off as gunwunner behavior now one more thing why are you browsing and commenting on a fan subreddit for something you are not invested in
pokemon,removed,hey man i didnt downvote him just explaining

pokemon,removed,how is he exactly an hypocrite in the very episode you mention ash was told that it was okay to not follow the rules when the criminals you are facing are breaking them first after that he never had a problem with this and even then rules have definitely changed over time given double battles became a thing in hoenn as per games plus that one time in the orange islands also again you are comparing dealing with small time thugs to stopping hitler theres a bit of a difference here
pokemon,removed,its real purpose it to build a wall and have the ratata pay for it
pokemon,removed,i feel like because of the aesthetic similarities yungoos has to a certain failed business man turned reality show host turned politician i want the rattata to win that battle
pokemon,removed,his businesses have filed for bankruptcy multiple times
pokemon,removed,good thing alola isnt based in mexico fairly certain yungoos would be nowhere to be seen cough we need to build a wall cough
pokemon,removed,could i get one if possible thanks
pokemon,removed,you do realise one of the rules on this sub reddit is to link the source
pokemon,removed,purugly tho
pokemon,removed,he is making alola great again
pokemon,removed,im not going to beg for codes but if you have an extra or will give one one away id be glad to accept it if you dont need the code

pokemon,removed,man this artist loves to draw booty
pokemon,removed,thread every time i see this argument come up ive never seen this as a response i bet a lot of people said oh
pokemon,removed,the artists other works
pokemon,removed,people do that all the time just no one words it that way when you see child stars on tv or movies you always wonder what they will look like when older or you think they look like their famous parent and you wonder if theyll grow to be that good looking or if they will fuck up and get high on meth and then look like chris jenner got crossed with a plastic wrap machine
pokemon,removed,hes not sexualizing pokemon he gave a year old girl a bigger ass and more curves bfd you wanna know what true sexualizing pokemon is google gardevoir youre not welcome
pokemon,removed,yes because youre tastes are indicative of youre sexual prowess of course he draws curvy ladies based off of cartoon characters he must be a virgin why dont you stop worrying about others getting laid and focus on getting yourself some
pokemon,removed,if all you see is an ass then youre the one perversing the image
pokemon,removed,i appreciate the support i know i shouldnt be surprised by now but im still taken aback every time at how aggressive some people are with this stuff and the kicker is this piece isnt even suggestive if someone finds this suggestive then theyre the ones putting a perverse lens on it and then being rude at me about it and yeah i dont like the flatness of prepubescent bodies so i always draw girls with late teenage body types or older
pokemon,removed,op thank you for drawing one of my favorite mons swadloon does not get anywhere enough love lil bundle of cute
pokemon,removed,full offense your art is terrible
pokemon,removed,i am a simple man i see booty i upvote

pokemon,removed,i come to reddit to have fun and shitpost not to feel
pokemon,removed,fair point
pokemon,removed,the fuck happened to the comments
pokemon,removed,this is fucked i made a post similar to this a week ago denouncing this app and was crucified before it was removed by the mods i had people telling me who the fuck cares if you dont play it grow up only for the mods to say my post was rude i didnt even swear in my post get your shit togethermods
pokemon,removed,shitpost sunday is tomarrow
pokemon,removed,thats called petty and being a little bitch probably why op was bullied in the first place
pokemon,removed,unsource artwork check repost check posting pokefusion on the pokemon subreddit even if it is banned here and has it own subreddit check looks like we got everything for a shit post guys

pokemon,removed,the problem i have with it is they should look for shady trades but it seems like they go through every post with the mindset that they are gonna find something wrong with it ive had a total of trades flagged because instead of saying i obtained through sos i just said obtained through sos if my trainer id and ot are with the pokémon do they really need to flag my post for something as stupid as that not to mention if you go to talk to them about them doing something this ridiculous they will just find one of your post from years ago and tell you to not ignore moderators every mod on the trade reddit sucks and they need to realize that of the people trading dont give two shits about their special format they require for any pokémon they consider valuable

pokemon,removed,how freudian of you there are no girls who play as girls because of penis envy in a fantasy world they are men due to wanting to have a penis
pokemon,removed,is there any pokemon x and y rom that doesnt have a survey or a password that requires a survey i really want to play the game

pokemon,removed,im so excited to see what they decide to do with team skull their theme is great their style is great and the way they move just oozes personality also these are the shitposts i like to see
pokemon,removed,not valid if you dont like something then dont participate but dont constantly complain until you get your way reviews and complaining theres no megas in the demo so no megas in the gameshit game with no features are very different i hope you get what i mean sure you can complain or you can just keep your mouth shut and play something else instead of ruining it for people who are enjoying it i think thats the problem these days everyone thinks their entitled to complain and things need to cater to them well actually no they dont you cant please everyone and if you dont have something nice to say dont say anything and if you dont like something then go try something else maybe play digimon theres a lot if megas in that franchise

pokemon,removed,christ it was just a little joke i wasnt complaining it was just kinda a little ocb kinda joke thing i dont actually mind at all whatsoever and i didnt realise that was implied with my comment what the fuck is wrong with you people
pokemon,removed,but it sounded distinctly like shut the fuck up
pokemon,removed,so the games are probably great i tend to do the opposite of what does
pokemon,removed,triggered
pokemon,removed,you know it is kinda funny how you originally stated in one of your deleted comments what the fuck is wrong with you people then have a much more sympathetic reply that remains undeleted here nice clean up work my man

pokemon,removed,im persian am triggered by the last sentence
pokemon,removed,game explain posted it on a few videos
pokemon,removed,i am the great mighty poo and im going to throw my shit at you
pokemon,removed,i like how you completely ignore that there are breeds in far worse shape than the persian ie american burmese or scottish fold ignore that siamese have been bred in completely the opposite direction from the persian ie elongated with huge ears and then go ahead and use a photograph of a thai instead of a siamese also theres a test for pkd now any decent breeder will be using this test so thats not a worry if you buy a kitten from a clearclear or clearcarrier mating stop pretending to know what youre talking about just because you read a buzzfeed article i for one do think that breeding for extreme brachy faces is gross and animals with such features should not be awarded at shows however from what ive seen the most extreme featured animals inc persians frenchies pugs bulldogs bullies come from rare colour designer pet breeders not show breeders prime example here httpwwwshrinkabullscom
pokemon,removed,is a series of photos of a bulldogs csection its extremely rare that they can give birth on their own

pokemon,removed,i recently found my old game boy advance and my brothers ds between the two of us weve got blue red yellow gold silver crystal and pearl i personally never played past gen ii but after replaying yellow im totally hooked and back in i booted up my version of crystal but it looks like theres an issue with the battery in it save files keep corrupting i havent tested out to see if my copies of silver and gold are also having this issue but from looking online i saw that there were reissues of silver and gold for the ds soulsilver and heartgold my plan is to go through and play every single generation of games so my question is sort of a two parter is it worth buying soulsilver or heartgold for my replay of gen ii even if my current copies of the original games dont have any issues with corrupt save files moving past gen ii what games would you recommend as the best to play from each new launch im planning on purchasing a in the next couple days so i wouldnt be opposed to playing omega ruby or alpha sapphire as my gen iii game if people recommend them over their game boy advance counterparts

pokemon,removed,also in aus missed out on arceus i would like it unfortunately i missed out on manaphy too
pokemon,removed,whats that
pokemon,removed,i know that one virusfree version should be on tpb just search for pokemon uranium and it should pop up
pokemon,removed,i found a download on uraniums website in the comments of their original update post it was posted by a website member not the actual group of people who worked on it
pokemon,removed,can i have it
pokemon,removed,because penis cock dick schlong johnny pork sword boner chode the d one eyed snake knob skin flute wheiner wang
pokemon,removed,thats why youll never win an olympic gold my friend xd
pokemon,removed,if this is something you would think want your boss to see then why even risk being on reddit at all aside from pictures of dogs and cats pretty much everything else on this site is just as bad or worse
pokemon,removed,i dont know about that my cousins friends uncle once went to the doctor for that and they just used an ax it was kind of like the picture but reversed
pokemon,removed,id let her lick my shadow balls ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° was i discreet enough
pokemon,removed,what the fuck is this alola bull shit
pokemon,removed,wtf one idiotic troll saying stupid things and suddenly an entire country with a population the size of tokyo is like this troll get real
pokemon,removed,httpswwwetsycomshoptaylorroseco
pokemon,removed,having to tag your own stuff as a shitpost is the ultimate demoralizer
pokemon,removed,why is this upvoted its autistic it doesnt rhyme with erection or anything its just stupid
pokemon,removed,its better than the alternative because ischemic priapism causes the blood to remain in the penis for unusually long periods of time the blood becomes deprived of oxygen and can cause damage to the penile tissue itself should the penile tissue become damaged it can further result in erectile dysfunction or disfigurement of the penis in extreme cases if the penis suffers from severe vascular disease the priapism can result in penile gangrene
pokemon,removed,oh give me a break its not even that big of a fucking deal
pokemon,removed,i would like one if u have any extras
pokemon,removed,i mean i can load up periscope have her sit in front of her computer use her decal machine and make one for you ill even have her mail it to you for free
pokemon,removed,its funny because i posted yesterday how the community in pokémon has been pretty awesome are you sure you belong here
pokemon,removed,also since you say you play on the pc theres a fan remake of pokémon red and green pokémon red and blue in na and other places called pokémon infernal red and pokémon natural green its not complete but its still very good heres a link to show where you can download it
pokemon,removed,not only scummy but a pretty stupid thing to say in a thread full of people desperate for a code youve informed your competition about this program and now a bunch of people are going to download it to match your advantage
pokemon,removed,im triggered
pokemon,removed,for those who also want these
pokemon,removed,you were completely in the clear after you deleted your comment no one bothered to screenshot the comment or remember your username since the post wasnt that interesting but thanks to this comment youve once again been associated with using some program to get codes its like youre defending yourself against allegations that only you knew about the way people reply here so fast is either by a form of notification or by manually checking it almost constantly which is more or less the same thing how is hitting refresh every seconds for hours on end the same as playing a video game or watching anime until you hear the ping the person hitting refresh will get burnt out fairly quickly while the person using the program can comfortably run it through december responses are quick because there are hundreds of people possibly over a thousand people at times lurking in this thread the rate of people hitting refresh is relatively uniform over extended periods of time thats not evidence of foul play unless the same users continuously win giveaways
pokemon,removed,no itd be really gay or totally fabulous or more stereotypes go here
pokemon,removed,you meant the guy with the green i swear to arceus i saw this exact same sticker on a green yesterday naturally it was deleted i give this post hours more of life before the purge

pokemon,removed,damn i
pokemon,removed,im enjoying the region quite a bit even if the alola getting is a bit cringey im honestly more surprised that sjwtypes havent thrown any accusations of cultural appropriation at this thankfully is it just that pokemon is seen through lenses too rosecolored to be complained about

pokemon,removed,this may be a shot in the dark but i figure i might as well ask i went by my closest gamestop today looking for a genesect card and i was told that they are already out of stock i dont suppose that anyone has an extra or is somewhere where they could be an extra that they would be willing to send me via pm i would greatly appreciate it
pokemon,removed,triggered
pokemon,removed,damnit
pokemon,removed,i hate it when people bring up cultural appropriation its the most dumb bullsht thing ive ever heard of theres nothing wrong from gettting inspiration from and referencing things thats what people have been doing for thousands of years in their stories and myths yet all of a sudden it becomes some crazy politically correct clusterf rant
pokemon,removed,good fuck you
pokemon,removed,cancer
pokemon,removed,dunno if you still have codes but i still play cause before pokemon go i didnt have any friends with the same passion for pokémons like me i met so many new friends and were getting even close meeting everyday so dont give go up

pokemon,removed,fuck outta here
pokemon,removed,hi all would anyone have a spare genesect and volcanian code by any chance grateful thank you

pokemon,removed,seeing the nsfw tag i was expecting something different
pokemon,removed,overused joke

pokemon,removed,came to see undertale reference was dissapointed
pokemon,removed,the hell is an undertale
pokemon,removed,because undertale is life undertale is cancer love
pokemon,removed,word association
pokemon,removed,seemed pretty innocent to me if the ability was called samus im sure some people would make the same comment
pokemon,removed,i mean its not that common to read the word frisk on reddit and not get an undertale reference
pokemon,removed,lillie and solgaleo with a nsfw aight ill bite was only sorta disappointed
pokemon,removed,while i cant fap to this it is amazing work op
pokemon,removed,i too can create a circle in mspaint color it in and copy it more times to make all the pokeball designs
pokemon,removed,i dont know after seeing the trump pokemon i want to busrt evolve with it
pokemon,removed,it doesnt have to be the game can keep track of a pokemons usage wins losses item usage bonding activities such as mini games and side games along with the friendship stat from there it could be put into an equation that calculates a total stat boost this doesnt seem gimmicky at all its a straight forward way of urging players to actually spend time on their pokemon
pokemon,removed,what an outrage when will a black woman be allowed to direct a pokemon game
pokemon,removed,so we can expect to much water in the new ones

pokemon,removed,rule no screenshots
pokemon,removed,not sure if this is the place but i didnt want to make a seperate thread for this so here goes i totally missed the darkrai event and was wondering if anyone had an extra code laying around or if they know where i could find one any help would be appreciated thanks

pokemon,removed,well you dont need to buy gems to unlock ballons like the digital version but idk about the wait time most likely though
pokemon,removed,i feel bad for you man what youre saying is true but you cant expect a normal reaction to this on something like reddit reddit is full of people who really have no idea how things work pretty much just socially oblivious losers a kid was bullied those kids need to die their parents should go to jail jesus people grow up
pokemon,removed,ya when act like assholes we should convict them in court u kno instead of suspending them andor sending them to a counselor to understand what they did jail all the children usausausa
pokemon,removed,theyre kids calm the fuck down

pokemon,removed,oh great another genwunner go back to your monochrome paradise you whiner
pokemon,removed,i agree go feels somehow unfulfilling because i cant upload my caught pokemon to bank so i have no incentive to play it i disagree with your last statement i recently started replaying yellow and mins into it i gave up the ugly sprites and the super slow gameplay is frustrating to each their own but unless gen gets a remake im not going to replay it
pokemon,removed,vagina dentata it means no worries
pokemon,removed,im playing dppt in my emulator and i cant seem to obtain deoxyss forms in the pokedex normal form shows up fine but it doesnt change in the pokedex does this have any requirement like i have check the meteorites first before the dex gets updated i obtained the deoxyses through action replaying wondercards

pokemon,removed,where do you guys watch the anime
pokemon,removed,literally no one would rename a dog unless its an adopted dog from a shelter wrong it happens all the time its not going to listen to you still wrong my dog will wag its tail and go bananas if i call him fluffernuts dogs dont understand words or names like humans i will tell my dog all the time in a cutesy voice that hes a dumb asshole and im happy i chopped his balls off and hell wag his tail and rub against me and jump up on me happily its my dog now isnt a reason to rename someones dog but it is its my dog now and i can rename it whatever i please
pokemon,removed,nice passive aggressive change to your post youre conveniently ignoring discussion outside of the tight lens youve decided to limit it to in reality there isnt enough material from the anime to discuss as it relates to whether or not megas will return ash didnt get a mega because a they didnt want to make him any more special than he already is b they didnt want to send him into alola with access to that or c none of his kalos team is capable of mega evolution there theres your reasoning from the anime as to why he doesnt get a mega and got ashgreninja as a replacement im done talking to you now
pokemon,removed,lets clarify i dont care about it id like to rename them myself my point is that the reasoning we come up with isnt enough to make them change it because every time its brought up they repeat the statement that its out of respect to the original trainer thats why i suggested using powersaves to rename it if he really wants it to because theres no other way to do it right now if i cared about it i wouldnt have suggested a way to do it
pokemon,removed,do people seriously have to insult everyone sorry not everyone looks as perfect as you mr model
pokemon,removed,is it civil to want them to pokémon gofuckthemselves

pokemon,removed,rule dont tradeexchange stuff go httpswwwredditcomrpokemontrades youll have better luck there anyway
pokemon,removed,i question how often sick children who live at childrens hospitals are able to use cellphones if theyre even at the age to own one because you arent supposed to use cellphones or other radio devices in hospitals this is a nice thought and all but not a very well thought out one
pokemon,removed,pretty awful you dont know how keys or intervals work do you just another kid with a laptop pressing buttons to play prerecorded sounds
pokemon,removed,you are playing too nice any violation to the rules should be punished accordingly not only for him but for anyone in this subreddit it is not fair for the original creator to have his art posted without proper credit and just giving a slap in the wrist to the poster who clearly violated the rules a warning is not enough
pokemon,removed,get a long shirt
pokemon,removed,grade a shitpost
pokemon,removed,how do i get gud at boppooyama
pokemon,removed,interesting and cool but lets please try to filter all wwwredditcomrpokemongo posts to its subreddit
pokemon,removed,uh what my has died plenty since ive got sun and not once have i been locked out of timegated activities nor has my clock or date reset to default your isnt that dumb thats like saying powering it off will prevent you from doing timegated activities which it doesnt
pokemon,removed,if you are usingrecieved hacked pokemon then youve been permabanned
pokemon,removed,clearly the comments and discussion on this discussion prove otherwise go fuck yourself
pokemon,removed,lol this is the mindset that brought about the censorship issue we have today
pokemon,removed,youtubes your friend

pokemon,removed,what all can you do with this emulator
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,somebody say nebby so i can tell at you
pokemon,removed,i am positive you have autism
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,the performance is hardly worth it due to how shady the emulators are i recommend citra an open source project like dolphin that will likely be the goto emulator for in the future
pokemon,removed,this thread irks me because it reminds me of sjw propaganda that makes a big deal about skin color someone actually thought that skin color was so important that they make a thread about how amazing and ecstatic they were about this when all it is is a cosmetic thing
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,i dont think youll get a reply from anybody who likes him here mate
pokemon,removed,i dont know who you are talking about
pokemon,removed,i was a fan a long while ago then i just stopped unappealing nowadays
pokemon,removed,they look racist
pokemon,removed,verlisify has lost all credibility as far as im concerned he spreads misinformation take everything he says with a grain of salt there are much better poketubers out there
pokemon,removed,oi fuck you buddy
pokemon,removed,who
pokemon,removed,i like him kinda his tutorial videos were extremely helpful especially woth breeding and how tk chakn a ditto i dont watch his competitive guides because i think that wolfy abd cybertron are better and more reliable for those i have tried to ignore drama on youtube and just watch who i like and i really dont care much about clickbait
pokemon,removed,i recently installed a plug in for chrome to block youtube channels guess who my only blocked channel is
pokemon,removed,i just watched verlisifys video thats where ive gathered this info from he usually doesnt upload anything unless he is sure link for video
pokemon,removed,i subbed for like a day he uploaded six videos complete with shitty allcaps titles like most broken pokemon ever ultra beasts are frikin insane in hours including a diatribe whining about how the new vgc rules wording regarding hackmons failed to explicitly permaban players who used them and it totally wasnt fair because i dunno reasons i guess i unsubbed
pokemon,removed,mods need to do something about these drampa shills running around
pokemon,removed,inbox me i will give you an axew
pokemon,removed,he was the first poketuber i found and taught me a lot about competitive battling he post videos every day and you can tell he really loves it that being said verlis has no chill he is bothered by things too easily he has thin skin and believes that whatever he thinks is right also he hates people who get their competitive mons in another way other than breeding which i would say most people dont mind since most people do it verlis knows his stuff pretty well and brings excitement to every video but he needs to grow up and quit complaining about every little thing that upsets him

pokemon,removed,when it comes to japan if a character isnt a blueeyed blonde that loves hamburgers lawsuits and speaks english theyre not american even if theyre blonde if you ask a japanese person what ethnicity the pokémon characters are they will say japanese japanese people dont like characters actually drawn to look japanese because theyre pretty tired of seeing the same looking people everywhere all the time in fact you can search about how japanese ff fans were complaining looked way too japanese when they saw trailers of it unless a character specifically says theyre not japanese they will assume said character is japanese its a mistake to assume that every culture sees themselves in the exact same way in media

pokemon,removed,see i tried to make three threads about this here but none of them were appearing in new i tried to ask the mods what was up but i didnt get a response
pokemon,removed,please dont bother me about this
pokemon,removed,is leaking
pokemon,removed,yeah thats gonna run like shit on a
pokemon,removed,what video
pokemon,removed,if youre a fan of pokemon go to twitchtvthe skater and get a free shiny hatching and enjoy his stream hes cool an nice
pokemon,removed,i wasnt lying but alright then and i dont think pokemon go is amazing i think its good but compared to the core series its shit all you do is flick your finger and swipe are people seriously butt hurt over what i said about miitomo i thought everyone was over it
pokemon,removed,my point was youre saying these things backhandedly you let people know that yes there are more features coming but wait lets make sure everyone knows that its the subreddits fault theres a difference between being transparent about future projects and this youre using those projects against the subreddit taunting it basically saying how we screwed ourselves over and you especially dont apologize by saying im sorry i ever did this sure you can be sincere and mean it like you said but it isnt an apology its saying you deeply regret something because of the outcome you received which yeah sure you can express that stop calling it a proper apology though youre modding a fairly large subreddit ive no clue how its been as peaceful as you say unless theres been heavy censorship which you said there hasnt been but honestly did nobody expect there to be a dark side and following that all of the top comments though against currentdark mode are civil everything youre saying in your initial comment is adding fuel to the fire you need to carefully choose your words or pick someone else to be the rpokemon scapegoat because youre not helping the teams pr even if you preface with how youre not going to be the pr rep with that comment im glad you appeared to have learned from this fiasco but the person behind your flair put too much emotion without thought behind some of the comments ive seen
pokemon,removed,its one of my decisions i regret the because i never got to play hgss and i cant play platinum anymore because i dont have a copy there are emulators online though emuparadise for one
pokemon,removed,here ya go d
pokemon,removed,you clearly dont understand how the real world works
pokemon,removed,i feel like there should be a third option dont change anything and keep the old css the new one is way too busy with random icons instead of hotnewrisingcontroversial the usernameflair boxes are gigantic while being barely readable leading to a lot of wasted space the developcollapse on every single comment is unnecessary httpiimgurcomuiegfixpng in the end the subreddit looks very cramped on anything below and even on a display the content feels drowned just a little comparison with other gaming subreddits im subscribed to in submissions per screen rwow almost submissions per screen roverwatch submissions per screen rmarvelheroes almost submissions per screen rgaming submissions per screen rpcmasterrace submissions per screen rworldoftanks submissions per screen rall reddit default submissions per screen rpokemon submissions per screen half of reddits default space is waste on rpokemon right now now im mostly on my phone or laptop when i browse reddit while this has obviously no effect on the phone experience the laptop one is horrible because how space is managed in i barely get submissions per screen on rpokemon against almost on rall i appreciate the amount of work put in by the moderator team but the quality isnt there at all and while the old css might have had behindthescene issues it worked visually
pokemon,removed,the poll should have been announcedpinned and left to run for at least a couple days preferably a week the most the mods do right now is a poll for maybe hours before declaring the side they want a winner ive never seen them let a poll run any decent amount of time
pokemon,removed,if you refuse to do all your duties as a whole you should just quit im sorry you worked hard on this and im sorry people trolled you but its no ones fault but your own that it doesnt look good you had the right idea but none of the aesthetic skill or know how on how to implement it you shouldnt give up but learn from your experience and come back after your break as a more informed and better moderator
pokemon,removed,can someone give me their friend code so i can get a fairy friend safari please mine is

pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,your flair text is ya fucking egit
pokemon,removed,lol this is just weird on no other subreddit do i experience people constantly pointing out how the mods are the best and we should all be grateful then you reach any kind of disagreement with them and you have a horrible experience getting muted from modmail and banned for long amounts of time it seems that only people who have never had difficulty or confusion on here are the people who say the mods are great
pokemon,removed,i finally got around to looking at the new layout on a desktop its worse than just the colors only threads can fit on the screen its bad but according to the mods its my fault for not liking it

pokemon,removed,im getting really tired of their shit now abuse of power arbitrarily backed up by vague excuses obtuse decisions regarding the rules and changes like the recent css switch and constant suspicious reenforcements that theyre the best moderators ever and we should be grateful the last one is especially weird because you dont see it on almost any other subreddit and the moderation here is far from perfect

pokemon,removed,didi you just assume its body shape triggered
pokemon,removed,well thats just how it is sometimes you just arent born fair sometimes gods or whatever you believe in doesnt play fair i was born as a rather slow child i wasnt as fast as everyone else and i moved at my own paste i wasnt born attractive either so that doesnt help with my rather slow personality every time someone sees me i could see a look of disgust on their faces they wont ever say anything directly to me but i got the message im not fishing for compliments either i know that im unattractive i also wasnt the healthiest child i was always sluggish and lethargic about everything i did i never found any self motivation and i hated myself for it still do because of this i was a pretty easy target of bullying i was always getting picked on and made fun of i would just curl up and sit there until the bullying stopped and they went away they would literally poke me with a stick because i was too ugly to even touch childhood was hard for me i was always crying and had mucus all over me from it that didnt help with the bullying at all then there was another prick that would make fun of me when he was just as slow as i was haha look at shaku curled up like a ball haha shakus got all dirtied up from laying on the ground haha shaku doesnt have a shell like the rest of us fuck you ethan youre a fucking snail the only thing thats different between us is that you have a fucking shell

pokemon,removed,this is some pretty sanctimonious shit you just said something to the effect of no biggie if you dont like them but youre wrong and your arguments suck lel and then go on to say you dont mean to lump people together ok except you just did if anything your arguments are among the worst ive ever seen theyre not backed by anything but gut and make no sense

pokemon,removed,that has nothing to do with rotom stupid click bait titles 😡😡😡😡
pokemon,removed,i mean you can nitpick a shit ton of pokemon from across all the generations a lot of pokemon are just this one thing and when it evolves it just this different
pokemon,removed,i dont really watch poketubers so all ive heard about him is that hes essentially the admittedly less horrifying chrischan of pokemon what would your opinion be on that and is he a furry like confirmed furry or is that just something people say
pokemon,removed,is this its true form
pokemon,removed,i saw a yt video that lusamine fused with an ultra beast
pokemon,removed,top tier shitpost
pokemon,removed,lol okay let me simplify this if you cheat on your girlfriend on monopoly on your taxes on your test you suck on some level or another cheating isnt good its lazy against the spirit of competition and it indeed does reflect on your character this isnt a debate the definition of cheating and the social norms that follow it have been predetermined
pokemon,removed,just a warning im pretty sure this may violate rule since genning is a form of hacking which is usually illegal modifications to the code
pokemon,removed,doot diddly donger cuckerino

pokemon,removed,spoiler alert one of the ultra beasts gets tail glow xurkitree the one that looks like guzma
pokemon,removed,what is a volpix do you mean vulpix how is it obvious that it should get tail glow when their tails dont you know glow while you are right about ampharos and maybe lanturn the rest of these do not make sense and no saying that its obvious is not a reason when it is not obvious and saying that since something get another move with tail in the name does not mean it should get this move

pokemon,removed,i really dont get this joke or why its become so popular you get three candies upon catching a pokemon so theyre clearly not hurt in the process of somehow getting candies from them why would getting just one require brutal slaughter when simply capturing them gives three times as many seems more like the professor just awards you with speciesspecific candies for catching something and helping him determine whats distributed where since thats his line of research
pokemon,removed,im on and can help you out
pokemon,removed,wow nice third grade level drawing you talentless sack of shit
pokemon,removed,these drawings are shit its so sloppy it look like a third grader drew it that other comment that says keep it up is just overly positive and wants upvotes you are shit at drawing

pokemon,removed,egypt got pokemon go freaking egypt with all the money they got from the west they cant buy more and better servers i think its safe to say that sea players have the right to demand some sort of bonus or compensation for this like free coins by level exp bonuses for a week higher spawn rates etc as a matter of fact give us battling trading and chat before nz us australia germany uk and egypt we get first dibs on the new content especially johto hoenn and sinnoh let them wait for a week or two
pokemon,removed,i tryed the apk i live in quebec and the game was in french so there is no excuse uninstalled the app because of possible malware us canadian dont exist and ill have to pay shitty overpriced data cap to play the game because canada

pokemon,removed,how about including something about all these redditor types abusing the psa initialism in order to demand extra attention and upvotes you are not doing a public service youre just some weeb on a forum clamoring for attention by attempting to masquerade your easily googleable advice as clickbait in some thinlyveiled expression of your ego its not that hard just to post the tip without the initialism in an attempt to derive more selfimportance to your post just be a normal person not the redditor stereotype people who use psa should be banned

pokemon,removed,i didnt know about france thats real shitty it sounds like youre just bitching about five days to me i get the anger and i hate that i had to stay off of this sub for two weeks because of some jerk leakers imo but that was something that a leaker not associated with nintendo or gamefreak did and thats what made me angry nintendo responding to rule breaking is just that they set rules for stores to follow and the stores broke the rules there are consequences to breaking rules and they arent good you knew about this five day wait well ahead of this rant many people were surprised with leaks that caused them to avoid this subreddit for weeks blame nintendo but dont make it their fault if they dont enforce the rules then nobody learns if they enforce the rules then the consequences are known to everyone thats how it works
pokemon,removed,horrible shitpost man trying to hard to troll man lol
pokemon,removed,the best part about team skull is that they arent even bad people theyre a nuisance wayward teens and social outcasts theyre crying out for attention in a society where they dont fit in hell most of us at some point could have been team skull members then theres guzma guzma just wants to be recognized for being strong and acts out because people dont look at him he goes to lusamine because she views his strength and with guzma gone team skull is a wreck they just want their boss back i love team skull
pokemon,removed,lets not forget lusamine and her cosmog killing spree
pokemon,removed,not the point of discussion and yet nintendo doesnt know shit if the player banned there didnt buy the game google digital backup copyright
pokemon,removed,at least you dont have it as bad as when it was first released days is nothing compared to what it used to be thats a shitty argument in the past localization and distribution wasnt as easy it happened with every game but thats not the issue the issue is that nintendo has the capacity to the a worldwide release the games are in our physical stores right now they just cant be sold because nintendo said the date for europe would be the days later except for france because japan still has that boner for paris no further explanation given i get that the game is really good and you want it right now but i dont remember seeing many australians complaining that we got the game after everyone else nowhere near as many europeans are complaining anyway oh geez its almost as if there are million people in europe and million in australia i wonder if more people means more voices to be heard and honestly in my opinion there arent even that many complaint threads or i just dont browse this sub enough and i do remember loud complaints when xy broke street date in some places in europe from americans they had the right to complain then but we also have the right to complain now at this point you guys who are complaining so much are sounding really entitled europeans are paying customers like everyone else if you are paying you are entitled to the product you are buying i believe we have the right to be annoyed at the situation and complain if you dont want to see complaints you can just not click these threads
pokemon,removed,no and please dont make pokémon a part of your sjw bullshit

pokemon,removed,youre taking a video game way too seriously you still have to playtest to develop any sort of skill someone with no skill cant gen a full team of perfect pokemon with a pre picked battle strategy and win against a seasoned player cheating or not also you dont know what game freak wants you dont get the exclusive authority to claim that by cherry picking things that fit your narrative i can claim game freak wants us to gen because theyve never fully patched it out why would they have left avenues open if they were so against people exploiting them that makes about as much sense as your argument does youre just salty because you dont like people playing in a different way than you do when it truly doesnt affect you at all this entire post and all of your subsequent comments are whiny and a complete waste of time and energy enjoy what you enjoy doing and dont worry about anyone elses stuff when the numbers are run it literally does not affect you or your ability to play at all

pokemon,removed,you are absolutely right just because he draws pokemon or uses chalk doesnt make it less vandalism i really dont get whats wrong with people in here they would probably be the first to complain if he didnt draw pokemon if he wants to be artistic he can draw on a piece of paper or his own property why does he not draw this on the wall of his room because he doesnt want it there
pokemon,removed,man it wouldve been cool if you had actually made a mockup of it mockup a model or replica of a machine or structure used for instructional or experimental purposes

pokemon,removed,youre too young to understand pichu is gen so its easy for op to misinterpret raichu as a two stage evo line for those of us that learned just pikachuraichu first the next commenter said did you mean pichu because he came in gsc and is the one that made it a family of now saying its stupid while providing one example of how op was wrong when it was an honest mistake is barely enough evidence plus im almost positive every other one revealed is a stage line so chill out and dont call people or ideas stupid simply because they dont think like you think

pokemon,removed,here is one na code
pokemon,removed,according to the regional dex leak we wont be able to get exeggutor until the final island but is that actually the case in a recent japanese trailer we see a level exeggcute this is clearly toward the beginning of the game so how is it possible to see one that early i know they use stand in pokemon for some promotions but since the game is finished it seems weird that they would take the time to do that now instead of just recording events from the final product
pokemon,removed,that looks fucking shit and your son will get bullied
pokemon,removed,btw whats an sjww social justice white walker

pokemon,removed,thats a terrible rebuttal whos to say i havent im tired of the overt focus on only a fraction of all pokemon
pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,we all know the vanilluxe garbodor bashing but it also bred this horrible mentality where some people have gotten excessively defensive of every newly revealed thing so youre saying that the genwunners created that problem in the first place if they hadnt been relentless in their unspeakable unyielding hatred of gen this problem would not have existed we would have been speaking more openly if it werent for genwunners but why would they change right now gamefreak seems to be catering to the whims of genwunners instead of its loyal and consistent real fans for that matter this whole genwunner shtick needs to stop nah the label is appropriate
pokemon,removed,is it just me or do people in this sub get really defensive whenever someone doesnt like a gen pokemon of course they will get defensive people remember that genwunners were relentless in their assault towards the gen and people saw the abuse like how you would take care of an abused animal and are now actively protecting their favorites gen pokemon are definitely the underdogs in the pokemon world whats the reward for the genwunners why gamefreak is now catering to their every whim its really unbelievable

pokemon,removed,your naming basis hinges entirely on ignoring the given names for the characters you dont select my naming basis hinges on a single concept that when you press start with an empty name it gives you the default name for the character this is explicitly true for the characters red blue silver hildahilbert and calemserena and assuming that the first listed name rule existed in gen the generation that ironically retired that rule why should they have retired that rule outside of fan assumptions what suggests that happened the rule remains true explicitly for four gens and could easily apply to gen as well which is supported by gen and confirmed names matching the rival names the thing is brendan and may arent your proper rival even with the supereffective starter they dont grow significantly as trainers or as characters by their last battle they dont even have their pokemon fully evolved giving up training relatively early into the game they dont reflect on what makes you a good trainer and why they couldnt catch up a theme that has been in every single pokemon game wally serves the role far more directly brendan and may were expanded on in both emerald slightly and oras a bit more but from the initial entry of rs the same with lucas and dawn only moreso you never even fight them they serve as a partner and a guide yet an entirely flat character even by pokemon standards this is remarkably different from calemserena who are with you and developing every step of the way when you raid a blaze base theyre right behind you when you visit the professor in lumiose guess who is visiting with you who else defeats every gym leader who else masters mega evolutions they even charge right in to take down the doomsday device with you even this is radically different from hilda and hilbert in bw who exist only on the multibattle train to be as generic flexible and universal as can be i guess what im asking though even if you dont find their roles as radically different as i do why is the displayed npc name more important to be consistent than the default player name

pokemon,removed,ignoring other stat distributions abilities and moves is quite silly when looking at the big picture those all really change how a mon plays just because a mon has higher special attack than attack or vice versa doesnt mean that its a special attacker same goes for physical attackers for example tapu koko is often run as timid or modest because it gets some awesome special moves and still hits extremely hard

pokemon,removed,my problem is that nobody correctly categorized birds as avians in this entire thread and when i finally pointed it out some asshole you decided you needed to argue with me about it even after admitting yourself that the word avian is used to categorize such creatures because of its latin roots and the use of latin in science clapback

pokemon,removed,i realize tonight that i have to quit playing pokémon you will mock me and say i need help but i broke my laptop in anger due to losing in miserable fashion it was a spur of the moment thing and i wish it didnt happen but it would seem that playing this game isnt for me if it causes me to get mad like that i wish there was a way i could still play but i used to be the same way with yugioh competitive games dont mesh well with me since i have this mindset that i have to win and thats all there is to it sighs im such a loser please dont laugh at me

pokemon,removed,im going to just let you know that youve made a mistake several times in a row that you should know about every time someone replies to you more than once you dont reply back and instead write a new comment this makes it so that the person you were discussing with does not receive your message in the inbox you can simply reply to them again indefinitely by making a new comment youre just making it harder on yourself to keep a conversation rolling and making it harder for others to help you
pokemon,removed,dude stop i know exactly what youre doing because ive done it before and by experiencing it i know exactly what its going to result in more pain for your sake and mine dont give us sob stories expecting affection to pour out at you judging by your many posts that youve made you are extremely aggressive towards attempts to help all i can suggest is therapy because youre clearly stressed even if youre losing a lot you shouldnt get so angry at a game that you would want to destroy your computer and how are people supposed to feel of course they can feel frustrated but they shouldnt feel angry they have fun because in the end its a video game its made for enjoyment not rage
pokemon,removed,not all of north america uses that shit format are north south even regional different in terms of region lock if not then you have even more countries that use a reasonable date format not this trash
pokemon,removed,not really its decent as a late game cleanup but a good team should have a way to deal with it it gets crushed by flying type priority from talonflame and mega pinsir heatran is a hard counter with hpground and multiple steel types like ferrothorn and skarmory act as checks without hpfire unaware clefable literally doesnt care about boosts most scarfers or revenge killers act as successful checks mega venusaur isnt very afraid of anything serperior does and ohkos with sludge bomb
pokemon,removed,if you have an etsy feel free to pm it to me if thats against the rules to post or some shit
pokemon,removed,between this and miitomo i guess nintendo just doesnt know to make good apps
pokemon,removed,does anyone know if game uk stores are still able to generate codes for darkrai even though the event officially ended yesterday i completely forgot about it because i had the most insane amount of uni work to finish if game cant anymore if anyone has a spare code i would be eternally grateful
pokemon,removed,praise evil faced savior of regions
pokemon,removed,its the mods trying to dump it all into one place making it harder for everyone
pokemon,removed,its obvious this is pointless you walked into your local toy store didnt get your stupid fucking toy and now youre going to blame the people behind the counter for also getting fucked over you are whats wrong in this situation an ungrateful entitled and bigoted consumer
pokemon,removed,its against the rules to post your own giveaway topic theres a giveaway thread already created on the right side
pokemon,removed,holy crap do you think you could help me get one i cant really offer anything but gratitude in return though
pokemon,removed,anybody who sred a mewtwo in xy did you ever run into him outspeeding your speed test poke even though he has a lower speed ive got my pokes speed at less than positive natured speed iv but mewtwo is outspeeding me no matter what his speed is so im ending up wasting a lot of time is this a known bug or something else
pokemon,removed,hi i was wondering can you contract cancer in the pokemon games
pokemon,removed,code beggings not allowed try trading for one or winning one in a giveaway such as the one in the sidebar
pokemon,removed,suspiciously i cant find the original post and i know this is a repost why are we required to send the original to the mods
pokemon,removed,do you see pokemon lightning yellow or mind crystal or pokemon delta emerald no you dont the possibility of a remake of platinum is basically zero also the oras games were pretty strong as far as a remake goes i didnt see anything wrong with them
pokemon,removed,im going to attempt to frame this as a question if anyone has an na darkrai code would you be so kind as to send one my way id appreciate it
pokemon,removed,the mods are fickle here when she posted that herself they removed it pretty quickly
pokemon,removed,clearly you never played rubysapphire or at least not a whole lot rubyemerald and black are my most played games in the series dont act like you know me and what i play your first problem was comparing oras with emerald liza and tates team a straight up copyandpaste from rubysapphire one of emeralds selling points was an increased difficulty yes thing is hgss included the best things from crystal and improved on them the fact that oras didnt further shows how fucking trash it is berry blending that fucking sucked in gen i had little to no way of maxing all of my contest stats because that game is beyond tedious and if i missed once it as all over for me at least with the remakes i dont feel like i wasted time that ill never get back if you sucked at berry blending its due to your incompetence it was extremely easy if you have basic cognitive skills but also addictive and fun no seasons at lest theres a dayandnight cycle now you ingrate or did you not realize that gen used a realtime clock i dont understand this complaint at all theirs been day and night cycles in every game since dpp this isnt new to oras less music then how did you sit through you ohsoprecious emerald emerald came out in oras came out in in its perfectly fine to expect and improvement in that amount of time unless your the kind of person who is perfectly fine with mediocre games pointless legendaries game freak wanted to make it so you could complete the pokedex using gen alone how about not asking why theyre there and accept it at face value because i like having actual lore instead of settling with stupid plotholes if youre the kind of person whos okay with shitty stories then fine but im not and i have the right to complain if there is a shitty plothole or unexplained event i actually like world building just remember that youre not the target audience year olds with their eyes glued to their cell phones are year olds arent the only target audience it isnt and gamefreak knows this they hold events such as the world championships which have loads of teens and adults who attend they have plenty of interviews on their youtube channel with adults and teens talking about their experiences with pokemon they even made a bloody super bowl advert thats sole purpose was to draw in older fans that must of cost a lot so theyre clearly aware they have older fans

pokemon,removed,
pokemon,removed,maybe people could read what i said and not just assume since i am going against the grain im wrong fuck off see i did a smiley so i can do that
pokemon,removed,whats the reference
pokemon,removed,yep ranging in between to hp the standard is hp though which most characters have those die pretty much as quickly as inklings tank characters have between hp they are meant sponge or mitigate damage done to the team much like tanks in a mmo but they dont really have an equivalent in splatoon splatoon has much shorter respawn times and inklings move way more quickly relatively to the map size so you get back into battle much quicker than in overwatch so tanks nor healers arent needed in splatoon in the way like they are in overwatch
pokemon,removed,what a piece of shit game

pokemon,removed,that sounds incredibly racist like guzma wearing blackface or something
pokemon,removed,fuck you i have wonder traded over a times hacked pokemon
pokemon,removed,i dont know the internet is a fucked up place and people apparently thought that gardevoir looks sexy or something with breasts also i guess miltank feed their young milk
pokemon,removed,where do i watch the sun and moon anime subbed

pokemon,removed,shitpost is shitty
pokemon,removed,i can trade ya one if you like
pokemon,removed,i dont think so but i can do a tradeback for free pm me
pokemon,removed,so you didnt press onward on logic that didnt match yours as someone should do in a situation like this seek first to understand then to be understood meanwhile with the things you listed you literally proved their point from a journey perspective you dont need a wall a support or a tank if you want to play through the game its why so many people hate meganium not only is its typing utter shit especially for johto but its a more defensivethemed starter meaning that its less powerful overall and such is less appealing over a ferocious crocozilla that leaves putout candles and bloody rattata in its wake while these things prove useful for competitive most players dont do comp so their points in the terms of going through a game without comp in mind are perfectly valid also what the hell is annoying
pokemon,removed,httpswwwsitesgooglecomsiteazoomiril
pokemon,removed,wow this is cool httpswwwsitesgooglecomsiteazoomiril
pokemon,removed,not in the slightest no im right when you put something on a platform where people are intended to comment on your submission it is stupid to expect nothing but positivity if this was on his facebook it would be a different story
pokemon,removed,like i said its a mistake to you not to op also objectively viewable as a mistake based on the arguments ive already made this is general not universal but its a wide enough phenomenon that it should still be pointed out to me it was sanctuary it was an escape from an abusive household toxic situations both at home and in school through it ive made lifelong friends and relationships it kept me sane through all of undergrad and even through grad school on my own games ive carried several pokemon as far back as the original sapphire yes being real im aware its just and but it has value to me youre being dramatic as a lot of people tend to be in these cases sure the games helped you in difficult times this still doesnt respond to the point that these are permanent and during the many years you probably have left to live it mostly will reach a point where they are no longer relevant to you why do something so permanent that you could so easily want to remove later on whats so difficult to understand why is it so hard for you to accept that others lead their own lives because people are stupid and make mistakes and we shouldnt assume the actions of everyone are wise and premeditated
pokemon,removed,we all did but i guess you didnt read rule
pokemon,removed,oh well welcome back to the community if youre starting again best you play one of the main series games two of which i recommend are heartgold and soulsilver which currently i am replaying currrently people sell physical copies of these games for much more than its original price so i would use a rom for that game as i dont believe nintendo makes any profit off of those games anymore desmume is a good emulator and if you choose this road i recommend downloading off of emuparadise as other sites can easily transmit viruses the other game on the list is x and y if you want to see a lot of the newer pokemon and of course the gen i pokemon along with bulbasaur charmander and squirtle i wish you luck in getting back in the franchise
pokemon,removed,shut up
pokemon,removed,i remember back in the good days of pokemon when the names werent so obviously forced and ridiculous now every pokemon just looks like a dumb stuffed animal and has the stupid name with it to boot smh ima start a petition to get rid of every pokemon in the pokedex after whos with me

pokemon,removed,id argue that it is the others who are overthinking this the entire notion of it being a plant disguised as an insect is solely coming from the fact that its a pure grass type when theres already a solid reason for it not to be a bug type the existence of a similar pokemon in leavanny its anatomy name and description all seem to indicate that it is insectoid

pokemon,removed,i read your entire post before down voting i down voted because youre over exaggerating and being generally negative
pokemon,removed,you know how many pokemon games have come out in the last few years plenty and here this subreddit is still friendly and intact our mods are more than prepared for this theyve been through it before with oras and xy before that and before that etc people didnt skip your wall of text youre arrogant as hell if you think everyone who read it would instantly agree with you and upvote i read all of it and honestly i disagree a few people will get grumpy well see a few heavily downvoted ugh i didnt want spoilers but im a moron who clicked the tagged link anyway comments and thatll be it my evidence a subreddit called rpokemon last year and rpokemon the year before that and so on
pokemon,removed,dude pokemon games have leaked for years now literally nothing ever happens this community doesnt cry about shit like that which is funny considering this is a sub for a childrens game lol

pokemon,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
pokemon,removed,the datamine shows that malicious moonsault requires darkest lariat so its probably a dark type move
pokemon,removed,i bet inceneroar development was something like this management we need to change the typing on this one dev why management cause we are getting a lot of hatemail for dual typing the fire starter with fighting dev but changing the typing now we have everything done the signature move flaming lariat and the z move burning somersault its to much work it cant be done😲 management it has to be done😐😗 make it a dark type dev a dark type😨 what about the moves😕 managementyes and the moves should be changed too dev ok then😐 lets call the signature move darkest lariat and change the flames to a darker tone and management i like that dev😎 the z move can be the malicious moonsault management😱 you son of a gun thats it🙌 check that in before anything else happens dev 😎sure so about the rise i was talking to you management i need to send this to everyone walking a way dev 😐😓😑

pokemon,removed,i want more megas in the dp remakes tho
pokemon,removed,the easy one there is an island upgrade in the poke resort that lets you put pokemon in diferent training one per stat mons gain in that stat every and can be doubled using pokebeans training time can be stablished in case you want an ev number distinct than up to pokes can be trained in groups of so you just put em there and wait a day a bam they are trained the quicker in festiplaza hope that the english name there is a shop that sells foods that maxes con ev stat from to at the cost of
pokemon,removed,you cunt i thought ive gone better at spotting that
pokemon,removed,ugh it pisses me off so much that and the fact his zmove is clearly a fighting move which is basically gf saying fuck you for not letting us make the fire starter a firefighting type for the hundredth time
pokemon,removed,hi mr doop i have a second genesect i can trade you sometime
pokemon,removed,one na code would prefer if someone had a code for one of the earlier event pokemon this year since i missed everything up to and including september so if someone has one ill trade code for code otherwise itll go to the person who can guess my original favorite pokemon from the first

pokemon,removed,well its an inanimate object so if i wanted to say its gender was an attack helicopter you couldnt tell me i was wrong
pokemon,removed,it official description gives no mention of it connecting to anything or anyone could be in a pokedex entry but i havent looked at those because fear of story spoilers only thing ive looked at is namestypesmove sets to do team building which is why i wish this subreddit did what rfireemblem did for fates and thats have not just one spoiler tag but several specific tags to indicate whether its a story spoiler mechanic spoiler or whatever
pokemon,removed,some people do but generally its anything goes a lot of people will try to be as gay as possible and use whatever is the most overpowered like gen random pss battles a lot of people would spam mega kangaskan or try to use an all legends team including mrayquaza if they challenged you with no restrictions if you want to battle someone in smogon tiers try the smogon wifi battle thread or the pokemon showdown wifi section

pokemon,removed,i couldve sworn that their offputting humanoid look and striking resemblance to guzma was hinting at them being kind of pokemonhuman hybrid experiments apparently not the case given the story spoilers probably too dark a path for pokemon to go down
pokemon,removed,my problem comes from back in the day when i started with gen where eveyone else was still a gen fucboi i got so much hate for liking gen more and it sucked eventually they all caught up and bought gen and i went back and played gen but finding things like makuhita and hariama just made me think wtf is this shit why is this good
pokemon,removed,its a story spoiler from the full games serebii wont update data on the games until the games release even then theyre technically both ultra beasts and legendary pokemon so its up to joe to decide which he classifies them under

pokemon,removed,hey those necks are like their necks make them look penis they all look like penises
pokemon,removed,ivs are values calculated into your pokemon the moment they are born think of them as genetics that dictate how much of an extra boost your pokemon will obtain toward each stat you may have heard of an npc that judges your pokemons stats they will vaguely tell you how good each iv is if a stat is perfect ivs at lvl that pokemon will have a stat bonus of points before that the value will increase slowly until then evs are much easier to control as they are gained through battle and luckily for all of us also passed on with exp share an example a scizor gives attack evs dont quote me on that and you beat it with your charizard lets say he has attack ev for expositions sake your charizard now has evs on attack meaning that he gains point in attack on his overall stats the way they are calculated is by dividing the number of evs in the stat by four and round it down keep in mind that you can train up to a maximum of evs on a single stat and that a pokemon can only have evs overall meaning that you can give them up to extra points in stats and some almost not even noticeable on a third stat or you can distribute evs evenly according to your moves or pokemon setup if you have any more questions about it feel free to pm me cuz i know both of those concepts are quite annoying at first uparvutleda

pokemon,removed,help i have a little brother who went to friends house with my copy of pokemon x and lost it there i was wondering if someone could help me out and give me a download code or some eshop money so i can buy it again
pokemon,removed,im in na
pokemon,removed,f
pokemon,removed,ive got two codes for na ill trade one for a volcanion code the other ill give to someone to help me do evolution trades
pokemon,removed,tips fedora
pokemon,removed,expect to be downvoted for sharing your opinion on a subject that doesnt even matter for example i hate arcanine and whenever i say so i end up getting like or downvotes people do and i do to hate it when people self promote their own channel and im pretty sure its against the rules anyway if youre going to post fan content youve made animations or art are usually allowed just be nice and dont be mean people here arent that bad just a small group to be honest i am one of those bad people but yea this place is good to discuss all things pokemon from fan theories to personal experiences enjoy your stay here
pokemon,removed,um i have a question if i live in the philippines where there are no gamestop stores here does nintendo give codes to local shops here if they dont then how do i genesect
pokemon,removed,i never got a victini code either would you be willing to trade for volcanion figured id ask
pokemon,removed,here you go
pokemon,removed,absolutely need it genesect and meloetta are the last pokemon i need for my pokedex before sun and moon on my pokemon x
pokemon,removed,just came here to say i guess i made the mistake of trying to buy a code on ebay i got ripped off paid the seller and he deleted the item and ebay wont let me contact him about the item since it no longer exists ebay also wont support me because its apparently not allowed to transfer online codes on there i suppose that makes sense i figured since im from a rural area far from gamestop its cheaper to spend a few bucks on a code than the cost of gas to get the code in person anyway be careful out there folks and if any of the kindhearted souls of this subreddit can help me out somehow it would be greatly appreciated and please dont say i should have seen this coming lesson learned already tldr scammed on ebay hope it doesnt happen to any of you
pokemon,removed,nah im just feelin for all the other folks who are prob in the same boat as me and want to at least raise awareness so no one else gets screwed you know
pokemon,removed,quality shitpost we are really running out of ideas while waiting for sm to come out
pokemon,removed,why are you posting this on the main pokemon sub which bans explicit content the fact that youre not technically violating the rules yet does not mean that youre posting in an appropriate place if youre looking for advice for your porn fanfics dont even start with trying to deny this maybe seek out a porn sub corresponding to your fetish filled with likeminded people who are actually into it instead of the main pokemon subreddit which is specifically not for porn
pokemon,removed,im triggered by that spelling of form
pokemon,removed,can i have code

pokemon,removed,i dont live anywhere near the distribution area sorry do you mind getting us a code since you live near gamestop id be cool if you did hope you get your card
pokemon,removed,yes you would be able to play mhxx on it i played through mhx on mine i was also able to use an english translation patch on it to translate the item names made it a bit easier to play through the more processor heavy stuff is also a possibility things like emulators can run better on it many people just inject roms in to the vc games though and use the native emulators many people have the gen games running via that for example and patched to use the new link cable emulation added with the gen games for more info there is a guide that covers everything httpsplailectgithubioguide now youre likely going to run in to the issue i pointed out earlier of not being able to do it right now if youre on system version or above youre going to need a second already hacked to install it if youre on or below you can do it with out its unfortunately just the nature of how it works you need to be able to downgrade your system to to take advantage of an exploit in that version to be able to install the hacks needed to run cfw on newer firmware new hacks come out every so often so even if you cant right now it doesnt mean you wont be able to in the future if you havent updated to the latest yet then dont update a new exploit is coming soon that will allow you to downgrade on and below with out a second there are a lot of warnings in the guide that make it sound quite dangerous but its quite safe to install now providing you follow the guide exactly all damage ive seen has been due to user error so far as for standard homebrew you can find info on it it is limited and it can be patched but it can run mods and region free but you wont be able to access updates for the games

pokemon,removed,you dont understand how triggered i am for these drawings i have been nice enough to keep it out because it is a good drawing but its contents is just furiating me i dont wanna be triggered becuase i know how much it disturbs other people but i just can not not be
pokemon,removed,did darrtrix just assume his gender
pokemon,removed,did you just assumed his gender
pokemon,removed,i dont see the problem that the game implies every pokemon has the most common naturewise most logical due to reproduction sexuality there is just because of todays times doesnt mean that a pokemon game has to be changed as well
pokemon,removed,can i have one aas well
pokemon,removed,can i get one
pokemon,removed,so as a trans person these jokes are really getting out of hand and kindof offensive
pokemon,removed,me please
pokemon,removed,plot twist dartrix is a female lesbian
pokemon,removed,can i have one thanks
pokemon,removed,ca i have one
pokemon,removed,this is dumb in real life tons of dudes have feminine aspects and the presence of femininity doesnt imply the lack of masculinity further why dont we have any posts about how masculineseeming pokemon are equally female this whole thing is juvenile
pokemon,removed,did he just assume its gender
pokemon,removed,dude pretending to not know famous people wont make you look cool
pokemon,removed,would you like a little salt with your sarcastic condescension
pokemon,removed,rpokemon has amaaaaaaazing mods huh
pokemon,removed,ive listened to this song since i was a kid and i never realized it was about transvestite until right now i always assumed the walked like a woman but talked like a man and whatnot meant something metaphorical like she talked with confidence i am not a smart man

pokemon,removed,to randomize any pokemon rom just use the universal randomizer httppokehacksdabomstewcomrandomizer if you need a guide on how to actually get a pokemon rom and an emulator there is a bunch of guides online for that
pokemon,removed,so about episode of the xyz series i came back to watching pokemon weekly with the xy series but as the climax of the xyz series was approaching i found myself unable to wait anymore for new episodes and ventured in the unknown waters of subbed anime i found some episodes with high quality subs but these come out weeks after airing in japan can anyone suggest how i can watch with decent subs as quickly as possible after release i cannot wait for serenas choice
pokemon,removed,if you are on am macbook like me i highly recommend openemu desmume works fine but openemu is just so much nicer looking and better organized so just download openemu and click on whatever things you want to emulate ds in this case then find the rom for the pokemon game you want here is a link for the heartgold rom i got double click the thing that is downloaded and volia
pokemon,removed,its a brony that attempted to escape its feeble form and made a pact with the pokédevil to change his form into a pony the pokédevil hates bronies though so he cursed him and put him into this miserable form only a genuine act of love from a pony can free the neckbeard

pokemon,removed,unless im misunderstanding the argument here im gonna assume op is a close minded womanhating child
pokemon,removed,swannas can be gay
pokemon,removed,rule
pokemon,removed,for instance petilillilligant you will never hear anyone seriously complain about it because they are female or taurus male but when obviously female pokemon have a low chance of being female or obviousle male pokemon have a low chane of being male or hell even an even chance it just screams too much of political bias remember first and foremost pokemon always was and still is a childrens game sexuality as a topic should just be left out hinted at or straight up stated should be left alone either way i mean hell they even go so far as to canonically state they have no idea how eggs are made because pokemon cant be having sex in a childrens game
pokemon,removed,agreed roseliaroserade and kirliagallade really iriitate me i mean its a childrens game leave the transgender politics out of it
pokemon,removed,this fart comes out from my butthole am i doing this right
pokemon,removed,anyone have an eu extra code please
pokemon,removed,the amount of comments of the style of ill take one remember me ooh can i have one its sad
pokemon,removed,you only really see homosexual behaviour in mammals and only really in primates and some whale species depends on what you consider homosexual behaviour though animals have a lot of weird mating rituals i would define it as a clear preference for the same sex and having any sort of preference beyond instinct is beyond the brain functioning of most animals the majority of the animal kingdom only mates to reproduce so they dont really engage in any sort of sexual behavior beyond that i also wouldnt count things like worms snails slugs and certain types of lizard because they only have one gender and again only mate to lay eggs grooming and other things i see as more social than homosexual for animals people are a bit odd that we see it that way also a lot of behaviors humans see as sexual like humping are sometimes only used to show dominance and dont really count in that case for homosexual behavior imo that said im all for including a gay gym leadertrial captainelite memberchampion it just wouldnt make a lot of sense to make some pokemon gay when it doesnt really reflect the animal kingdom that much just to make breeding even more of a pain in the ass and attract slightly harder to use
pokemon,removed,how are u guys
pokemon,removed,hi can someone give me a code to get volcanion please ill be very grateful
pokemon,removed,need a fennekinfree version
pokemon,removed,as an fyi i do know of one and only one event that had a chance of being shiny it was for a with a couple of unique moves reportedly it had a in or so chance of actually being shiny and the event was repeatable now were talking magikarp but still an event that broke a number of the normal event rules

pokemon,removed,sighthis mediocre fan theory again there is a japanese youkai that eats and impersonates people by absorbing their memories then goes out eats their families with the acquired information i think this was also the inspiration for majin buu
pokemon,removed,word of god fancanon no matter how much it hurts you
pokemon,removed,nice headcanon did you think it all yourself or you stole it from a poketuber
pokemon,removed,smiley face on an amoeba thats literally the only thing we have
pokemon,removed,when something refuses to die you double tap this thing was debunked by word of god and people still cling to it they laughed at how absurd this was and yet people still cling to this theory
pokemon,removed,fuck off you trash nobody wants to go to your sub
pokemon,removed,may i have a code thanks

pokemon,removed,i once had a shiny charizard named niggerzard
pokemon,removed,your penis gets erect for sm ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
pokemon,removed,i think i get it now kinda a weird thing though if you like to put your penis in a vagina why should it matter if that vagina was put there surgically just because somebody switched from male to female genitalia doesnt mean much obviously the same goes for switching the other way
pokemon,removed,still amazed people can doubt these are real denialfags eternally btfo
pokemon,removed,should so your opinions ares the rules i agree with retro he looks so cool with that fire belt i dont understand where this recent quadruped fetish came from
pokemon,removed,masculinity is fragile people chose diamond over pearl because they felt girly choosing pearl all these macho pokémon players hate anything girly unless its waifu status a girlie starter over a tough cool guy starter never
pokemon,removed,oh boy i had a friend complain about how girly brionne is today i cant wait until i found out he got stabbed during the middle of the night
pokemon,removed,bc men are weak and cant be comfortable with the fact that something with a greater chance of being male is feminine
pokemon,removed,people sadly equate maleness or masculinity with the default or even worse something to aspire to or a pinnacle of humanity or goodness thats not to say that everyone who dislikes brionne does so for this reason but there is an undercurrent in society of valuing masculinity above femininity and insecurity in masculinity you see it in people saying things like real man people insulting others as being weak or worse than them by calling them female body parts guess id better turn in my man cardyou have to turn in your man card now sort of thing i could go into even more detail but the moreso i would i could go into further and further controversial and questionable territory this is a really deep subject that there is a lot to talk about a lot has been talked about is very personal and gets a lot people riled up suddenly a wild rfeminism appeared
pokemon,removed,up you go
pokemon,removed,thats actually impossible unless you want to be told news by an unemployed manchild
pokemon,removed,the shitposts go everywhere else
pokemon,removed,incorrect noj has stated they are fine with fan projects in the past multiple times however they arent the ones that work on protecting their image in the western markets which is where the fan games are commonly taken down and are regulated by nintendo of america this is why we dont ever hear anything about noe or noj doing any takedowns as noa is doing their own way to protect the nintendo ips while leaving up most small projects that arent making money or making them loose money

pokemon,removed,thats what the spoiler tags are for friend the mods will enforce usage of it if this happens and it will happen the best thing you can do is either avoid the subreddit altogether or just refrain from clicking into spoilertagged threads its not that hard
pokemon,removed,were not dead were dancing party like its pm in all seriousness we do have a pretty close devoted cult following myself included on stream and on httpswwwredditcomrtwitchplayspokemon and that isnt dead at all a dead stream would be a stream without followers which isnt at all what we have actually we have pokemon battle revolution going on httpswwwtwitchtvtwitchplayspokemon along with a highly controversial sidegame called pokemon ultra which if youve heard about it is a notoriously bad romhack
pokemon,removed,we le did it le reddit xd
pokemon,removed,you simplify and then find the values of the variables kids these days are so fucking stupid i swear
pokemon,removed,so youd be fine with
pokemon,removed,considering ashs charizard spent most of its screen time ignoring ash and either napping or attacking the little wiener hes always been a joke
pokemon,removed,ive got an extra darkrai that id like to trade for a manaphy i just realized i missed out on last months event and im really bummed im even willing to trade an extra shaymin pm me and we can work out the trade
pokemon,removed,i think it might be easier on mobile i saw an option to link up using the gbgba emulators i got from the google play store
pokemon,removed,i remember playing a pokemon emulator it was online and me and my friends played and beat the game i cant remember can anyone help me find what emulator this was

pokemon,removed,the sheer amount of defensiveness people show towards the fact that litten should be on all fours all the way through its evolution or popplio be waterfighting or rowlet cant evolve into anything but a larger owl so basically this sub is autism central
pokemon,removed,cosplay looks alright except for that gut
pokemon,removed,this is such a stupid post
pokemon,removed,i got you fam right
pokemon,removed,as far as heart gold and soul silver go i personally recommend desmume quality ds emulator ran fine even on my old dinosaur of a laptop although i couldnt find a way of connecting with actual ds games so dont count on keeping anything
pokemon,removed,before this most likely gets deleted my boy for gba games like frlg and dsmume for ds games one is one mobile the other on pc
pokemon,removed,i lack understanding of game design well im a player not a designer also you can google videos and posts about these things being wanted so lots of players would like some of these changes you should play pokemon and understand stuff more you may be a game designer but you definitely are not a player

pokemon,removed,because this is the topic thats being discussed people view the franchise as making a comeback because its been out of their lives for quite some time and this goes for the general public ie the majority of the developed world yeah the franchise has been going strong but its become extremely complacent within its niche in corporate business brand recognition is everything what better way to capitalize on it than making a game thats accessible to everyone its doing the franchise a lot of good and its only going to get better from here theres really no need to be so condescending by calling it pokemon lite its this type of elitist bullshit that turns me off about this community
pokemon,removed,needs more hair like more hair

pokemon,removed,show us your tits
pokemon,removed,two weeks ago you pull up anyone on the street and ask them to name a pokemon besides pikachu the most common answer would probably be no idea or some gibberish ask anyone today and the outcome would be significantly different thats what i mean by brand recognition what you meant is false then most people knew as much about it then as they do now this so called pokemania was a gen i thing and this pogo is a gen i thing releasing pogo isnt going to increase anyones knowledge of anything releasing pogo with all the pokemon would as it is theres nothing this app teaches to the general audiences that they didnt know this game has exponentially augmented the attention and interest of the franchise for a couple weeks months perhaps yes theyre still fans even if theyre only playing a simple mobile game thats like saying people who only read star wars comics and want nothing to do with the franchise fans you can say they like pokemon but i wouldnt call them fans unless theyve picked up one of the main games or official spinoffs at least plus youre ignoring how many are just genwunnersnostalgiababies wholl leave as soon as they add new pokemon yes pokemon is one of the best selling ips its well beloved among existing fans and the gaming community case closed ask someone what pokemon is before pokemonlite im pretty sure theyd have an idea just because pokemon wasnt on the news doesnt mean people are unaware of it you forget that genwunners are a pretty small minority this is what i previously assumed and ive even defended some due to the very little ammount ive seen of them on reddit compared to people shitting on them but with pogo released ive seen a gross number of them lately in this very thread theres a link to an argument on rgaming thats flooded with genwunners or pokefans trying to defend them its disgusting ive even seen a lot on here talking about how theyll drop it after so long and talking crap about newer pokemon youre only seeing more of them because youre on a niche subreddit so i should go outside the primary subreddit for talking about pokemon in order to find people willing to defend newer pokemon games lol you cant just call everything niche and call it a day but the current popularity tidal wave is so strong that its already made a huge impact the real question is how long will it last well have to wait and see on this but if theres a flood of posts or comments on here or rpokemongo about the newer pokemon or how theyre leaving then that confirms my suspicions can you imagine how clunky it would be if they ported the full battle system from the main series games thats still the battling system everyones familiar with and requires thinking to do its a watered down version basically its not an rpg its ar its your story pffft lets be real most of our lives arent as interesting as a main characters is saving the world from destruction meeting legendaries learning of different pokemons lore through hidden areas or npcs its still lacking what makes the main game interesting even if i do enjoy it ill admit this im just off put by the sudden upstroke of defensive real fanswho think theyre better than the new players who were attracted to the series through go understandable but for me its not about people wholl end up liking the franchise and sticking to it its about those who this js just a fad to potential bandwagoners or to those that are gen i purists and wont accept anything past it its also slightly annoying to see people irl only referencing the originals people making puns on pokemon names only from the original and people making posts here of how their so made something but its only from the original i guess id like to speed up the process to see if anyone will actually become familiar with the newer gens or if theyll just be there while people imply acknowledge the originals and what they grew up with theres also the people like my friend who brag about being better than me in pogo having pokemon with cp i have to try my best to stay calm and not rang about how i know pokemon inside out and how ive iv bred dozens of pokemon as well as ev trained even more and the fact that i could curbstomp them in the main games instead i simply say yeah
pokemon,removed,what are you talking about remaking it for the will give it access to pokemon bank and easily transfer it for the games to come rather than hvaig to go through games handhelds and applications remastering it will help fix the things that make it suck and there is no online anymore so its basically impossible to complete the pokedex

pokemon,not_removed,just got it thank you
pokemon,not_removed,i appreciate
pokemon,not_removed,thanks so much from arkansas buddy
pokemon,not_removed,the giveaway thread is literally right above the create a discussion link gg
pokemon,not_removed,👍🏽👍🏽
pokemon,not_removed,i saw this and was a a little put off by its wing being burnt to a crisp but i guess that is what you get when you play with fire eh eh
pokemon,not_removed,i think the wing is an awesome touch
pokemon,not_removed,yeah my split second reaction thought it was cool but then my reasoning kicked in and the fact that a fire type cant be burned ingame i was just like that is not quite right
pokemon,not_removed,i swear as soon as i evolve then mevolve i will be worshipped
pokemon,not_removed,what did ramos do to you
pokemon,not_removed,this was common knowledge daycare workers have had a visual identifier of an egg since at least generation
pokemon,not_removed,yep and if you use the little fenced in area just south of her you have enough room to spin around on tauros to hatch the eggs quicker and go grab another one when she crosses her arms
pokemon,not_removed,i actually had no idea about this thank you
pokemon,not_removed,this becomes obvious to anyone that has tried hatching more than one egg in front of the daycare
pokemon,not_removed,gen aswell
pokemon,not_removed,isnt faster to not run around in the pen as you have to dismount every time an egg hatches i just use stoutland and run around next to the lady as i dont need to watch the screen to run in circles with stoutland and i have a free hand
pokemon,not_removed,at least it helps someone ¯ツ¯
pokemon,not_removed,that is a good point i just get into a better rhythm in the pen does sprinting on stoutland increase steps like tauros does
pokemon,not_removed,so long as you take the same amount of steps
pokemon,not_removed,cool well ill try that out tomorrow thanks for the reply
pokemon,not_removed,filled in it was nice to think about oras again i havent thought about them since they came out hahaha
pokemon,not_removed,i love hg the starters the two regions going up against gym leaders that youre way underleveled for the intense rivalry its so satisfying oras has cool megas and great move tutors
pokemon,not_removed,aaand done good luck with the paper
pokemon,not_removed,cool survey sorry about my long answers i tried keeping most of them concise
pokemon,not_removed,done i always assumed hgss was my favourite by far but this made me realise how close oras is hgss still won for me though nothing can top that climactic battle with red
pokemon,not_removed,i had fun comparing the games hgss is the best remake but oras is the best to this date in terms of game mechanics imo tha being said my favorite game is xy beacuse of the breath of fresh air ir gave to the series im playing since rby and i think xy was a massive improve to the franchise
pokemon,not_removed,definitely oras from a purely objective standpoint hgss didnt really fix the issues from gsc and added a few novelty aspects pokemon following is a novelty and does not affect gameplay much oras delivered in upgrading the overall plot of rs while adding key features such as dexnav that directly affect gameplay in a positive way
pokemon,not_removed,filled in any other questions gis a shout
pokemon,not_removed,filled it out sorry for my huge paragraph answer it was very interesting and fun to think about the games as which is the better remake rather than which is the better game
pokemon,not_removed,i answered as well as i could the answer to the last one might be a bit weird if you see a question as an answer that may or may not be mine
pokemon,not_removed,submitted
pokemon,not_removed,all done happy to help and good luck in all your endeavors
pokemon,not_removed,id easily say oras hgss didnt do much for menot helped by the fact that i wasnt too big on gsc either
pokemon,not_removed,i contributed if you dont mind me asking what kind of school project is this
pokemon,not_removed,filled in i did my best to compare them but my responses probably shouldnt be shown to your teacher
pokemon,not_removed,i filled out my response
pokemon,not_removed,rather recently ive replayed the both of them so theyre actually rather fresh on my mind it was a very hard choice for me since i like both hgss and oras so i kept in mind which one i enjoyed more while replaying and i ultimately chose that one the answers i gave are rather long so i hope you dont mind that i wish you luck with the project
pokemon,not_removed,there was something i could do in hgss controlwise that xy didnt have it made a difference to me i also just cant get into oras as much because of the pokemon choices i really dislike gen models and type combos
pokemon,not_removed,i think on a personal level id choose oras but honestly in gameplay features over all difficulty and over all length hgss is superior only part oras really beats them on is the post game content
pokemon,not_removed,i hate hgsss evil team level curve pokedex pokeathalon lack of a simple way of getting evolution stones boring gym leaders awful starters and the rematch system i like the way hgss looks and walking with pokemon i hate oras being too similar to the originals but they changed some stuff at least
pokemon,not_removed,thank you
pokemon,not_removed,no problem i actually prefer more fleshed out answers thank you very much for responding
pokemon,not_removed,similar here hgss were fantasitc but in my mind the changes that oras made to the characters sold me
pokemon,not_removed,the walking may not affect game play per se but the happiness factor does affect game play
pokemon,not_removed,oras also watered down several dungeons just like xy i think its the worst part of gen you cant have an unknown dungeon that is one room i was looking forward to that the entire game similarly granite cave and sky pillar were butchered and disappointing at least hgss kept the explorability of the originals
pokemon,not_removed,its just an english class and we have to write a paper comparing two similar things it has to declare a winner as well since im rather passionate about this subject already i chose to write my paper on it she said we could do surveys to gather supporting information too which is what this poll is for
pokemon,not_removed,heartgold and soulsilver actually expanded the areas from the original games they added viridian forest seafoam islands mewtwos cave the pewter museum the fighting dojo pal park at the fuchsia safari zone and new johto additions routes and and the new safari zone a pokeathlon area a full battle frontier where crystals battle tower used to be oras doesnt even have a frontier even though emerald version had the very first one small extra bits in the games like the pond by sprout tower or the magnet rail going through route or the spiral area around slowpoke well they also added lots of legendary pokemon you could catch and gave each one a dedicated area to explore and find them in unlike oras where most of the legendary pokemon were found just by soaring in the sky
pokemon,not_removed,seafloor cavern seemed easier too
pokemon,not_removed,that sounds great just wondering which do you prefer hgss or oras surely you must realize that oras is the only correct response
pokemon,not_removed,i personally prefer hgss actually i picked hgss and oras because hgss is my favorite remake and oras is my least favorite remake plus they both seem to have much strongerdiffering opinions behind them than frlg
pokemon,not_removed,and theres nothing wrong with preferring hgss so what dont you like about oras
pokemon,not_removed,if you wouldnt mind could i see what your pros and cons are i find it interesting to see other peoples opinions on games
pokemon,not_removed,claimed celebi
pokemon,not_removed,claimed darkrai and got a jirachi from one of the generation packs gg the luck
pokemon,not_removed,i claimed jirachi thank you very much
pokemon,not_removed,i wasnt sure if they included the packs or just that individual pokemon definitely a perk of that one
pokemon,not_removed,its not a promo card its rarity is just an uncommon but it came out foiled
pokemon,not_removed,i mean they came from those boxes with the promo code and packs but i thought the code would be just the darkai glad you guys get more out of them
pokemon,not_removed,oh it comes with the promo card generations pack and a box for cosmetic
pokemon,not_removed,neat
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think those will be affected pgl has been around since gen and while it removed support for those games when gen came around i think that other online functions stayed up for a while they were shut down eventually but that was more because the whole nintendo ds online infrastructure was shut down rather than a pokémonspecific thing since sun and moon are on the same console as gen nothing should happen
pokemon,not_removed,pgl shouldnt have any effect on passerby stuff or opowers they dont have anything to do with pgl you just wont be able to the features on the global link website that pertains to connecting to gen games
pokemon,not_removed,not sure what im more shocked and impressed about the fact that garchomp can fly or the fact that he can surpass mach speed
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,us government has got some explaining to do
pokemon,not_removed,found celebi
pokemon,not_removed,in the cornish dialect of english pokemon meant clumsy in the mid there was a surge of writing the cornish dialect of english to preserve the words in glossaries
pokemon,not_removed,yoooooooo some of the ben aliens would actually make some decent pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,the egg is determined as soon as you pick it up you cant reset its contents
pokemon,not_removed,eggs are determined at least in advanced although some factors can alter results eg changing from masuda method to just sheer luck so even if you reset before you picked up the eggs from the daycare youd have no chance
pokemon,not_removed,it is determined before you even put the parents in the daycare
pokemon,not_removed,moderately unlucky considering the normal chances of getting a shiny
pokemon,not_removed,so long as you use mm or have a shiny charm you can just breed magikarp due to the fast hatch rate and so long as you save every box or so and never when you have unhatched eggs when you hatch a shiny magikarp you can reset the game swap out the gyarados in the daycare for whatever you want a shiny of and the same number egg will still shine though if you want a shiny genderless you should look up a proper description of the magikarp method as that will affect it
pokemon,not_removed,honedge is genderless so you should google the magikarp method others will explain it a lot better than i can though you can save in between i get eggs hatching them as i go and on the egg i take gyrados out of the daycare hatch the last eggs then save you can save however often you want you dont want to save when you have an unhatched shiny magikarp or youll be stuck with it
pokemon,not_removed,if ditto has a destiny knot dont change that and why wouldnt you use one
pokemon,not_removed,i got my ditto and its destiny knot from rpokemoncreate though codes are out for powersaves now so it shouldnt be too hard to get your dittos iv changed i think you get destiny knots from pickup
pokemon,not_removed,its also worth mentioning in the slowpoke episode slowpoke kept saying slowpoke until he saw his own tail and realized he was a slowbro
pokemon,not_removed,i spent all week researching writing recording and editing this video p the whole idea behind this theory is that slowpoke isnt the one that evolves but its actually shellder that does and that shellder is working on the answers to every question ever
pokemon,not_removed,this was awesome i love shit like this
pokemon,not_removed,very well puttogether theory it seems plausible maybe someday well get to see a regional variant of shellder that resembles its slowbro appearance
pokemon,not_removed,if you want to see some more theories i suggest birdkeepertoby and lockstin of gnoggin theyre two great poketubers
pokemon,not_removed,that would be pretty cool
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think the event has been announced for the uk yet but as and when it is you should be able to just ask for the code and get it for free if they try and tell you otherwise theyre just looking for sales every code giveaway ive ever seen has been free
pokemon,not_removed,nope you walk in ask if they have codes if they do you get one or a few if theyre needing to get rid of them only if its near the end of the month no need to buy anything
pokemon,not_removed,he looks even more like viral from gurren lagaan now
pokemon,not_removed,spam health items a lot in battle sounds about right
pokemon,not_removed,naturally the mc has an unflinching face of mercy
pokemon,not_removed,these are great hau seems particularly perfect
pokemon,not_removed,shit everyone grew up to be hot even hau especially hau
pokemon,not_removed,tapu koko aint havin any of that sugary bullshit
pokemon,not_removed,stares at gladion needs more edges
pokemon,not_removed,good to see haus pokemon is the legendary top kek
pokemon,not_removed,its yours now whwho left a bowl of onions here
pokemon,not_removed,still does parttime job for a living love it
pokemon,not_removed,hau offering us a starter malasada killed me lol
pokemon,not_removed,holy shit this is great and love how you the artist mixed the boygirl mcs
pokemon,not_removed,the champion stare right through your soul well that was how i beat youngster tristan
pokemon,not_removed,this persons artstyle is fantastic i feel like tumblr pages are trapped in some void that doesnt reach the surface of the internet unless a random redditor happens across it
pokemon,not_removed,i want this in a sequel really really bad now
pokemon,not_removed,professor lillie is just the best thing
pokemon,not_removed,removed
pokemon,not_removed,i love the genderneutral look they gave the mc the idea of our character having a frisklike design pleases me
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt think i could love hau more well ill just add that to the list of things im wrong about
pokemon,not_removed,these are fantastic
pokemon,not_removed,but what if it was the male character will it be dating lillie
pokemon,not_removed,dear god i hope they make sequels to these games with these characters in them
pokemon,not_removed,id like to see one boy mc and one girl mc instead of mixed
pokemon,not_removed,my only complaint is that i think gladion would tone down the rebellious clothing style he has now that theres not that much for him to rebel against he can still wear black and red and have his hairdo i just dont think hed have a hoodie or scratches on his outfit anymore canonwise he becomes head of aether
pokemon,not_removed,sweet are there more from other games
pokemon,not_removed,its not a phase mom
pokemon,not_removed,i somehow feel like that wouldnt be the way lillie would be i kind of imagined shed become a great trainer later on but who knows
pokemon,not_removed,i want to see young burnet with kukui and guzma
pokemon,not_removed,huh is that a zcrystal on lillies neck if it is and its not just a decoration its got to be either ghostium or poisonium z could be ghostium if cosmog became lunala or it could be poisonium given to her by plumeria as an apology
pokemon,not_removed,their newest comic
pokemon,not_removed,nice job nailing the gender neutral
pokemon,not_removed,everybody grow up gladion became more edgelord than ever lillie is a responsible and productive member of the society hau became a kahuna and you still has no expressions
pokemon,not_removed,what happened to the post i want to see the pictures too
pokemon,not_removed,heh lillies pen is an alolan exeggutor and gladion is in the background freaking out about hau chatting up lillie fantastic art style btw
pokemon,not_removed,lillie her name is also a plant well to be honest everybodys name is based from plant of some sort for example httpsenwikipediaorgwikihibiscustiliaceus httpsenwikipediaorgwikigladiolus and httpsenwikipediaorgwikiimpatiensbalsamina please consult your local bulbapedia if someones curious for another
pokemon,not_removed,which malasada do you choose is hilarious the filling colors even match the starter colors xd
pokemon,not_removed,in that hair braid chain pic mcs expression actually looks appropriate
pokemon,not_removed,very nice really captured the characters well the fact that we have a customizable avatar is a bit of a shame because we are unlikely to get the red moment from gen ii ever again beause of it
pokemon,not_removed,gladion looks even more edgy now lol
pokemon,not_removed,i love all of that artwork but i dont quite see gladion being an eternal edgelord he developped quite a bit during the game too id imagine him wearing a combination of highrank aether attire with some elements of black thrown in like an open white coat with a black shirt
pokemon,not_removed,i was kinda hoping to see the female and male mc grown up not a mix s
pokemon,not_removed,your reaction lillie will be the new kanto professor
pokemon,not_removed,does lillie have a freakin alolan exeggutor pen
pokemon,not_removed,hands off lillie
pokemon,not_removed,mc
pokemon,not_removed,dont like the edginess of the art
pokemon,not_removed,disappointed the male mc wasnt there unrealistic emotion in female mc
pokemon,not_removed,cannot unsee am convinced he is sent by the spiral king to fuck shit up
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,oh my arceus i cant unsee it or unhear it and i dont want to i seriously want to see a gurren lagann pokemon sunmoon crossover now with olivia as yoko too
pokemon,not_removed,thats the voice i gave him in my head
pokemon,not_removed,youre never a true champion till you master the art of the full restore d
pokemon,not_removed,man how difficult would it be to be fighting against a champion with max revives
pokemon,not_removed,man how difficult would it be to be fighting against a champion with max revives
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,yea that face does a suprising amount of staring
pokemon,not_removed,i love the accuracy
pokemon,not_removed,id get a malasada with that
pokemon,not_removed,maybe tapu koko prefers bitter malasadas
pokemon,not_removed,unless of course its a bowl of his own brand of delicious patended koko pops
pokemon,not_removed,you rang
pokemon,not_removed,psh nothing personal kid
pokemon,not_removed,top kek im fucking dying ahahhahaa
pokemon,not_removed,in case yall are confused
pokemon,not_removed,then it turns out he does it to get an idea of which starter they might prefer to have
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i thought the same so cool
pokemon,not_removed,my friend who uses exclusively tumblr thinks the same thing about reddit
pokemon,not_removed,if black and white can do it cant see why not sun and moon
pokemon,not_removed,remindme years well see if they apear on the battle spaceship in gen
pokemon,not_removed,totally the drawings put her in the perfect role for her
pokemon,not_removed,mods said oc art only im glad they let it stay up a fair bit though
pokemon,not_removed,the undertale is strong in this comment section
pokemon,not_removed,this interpretation is so genderneutral i took it as representative as either has the males shirt and shoes and the females hat and her shirt as a shawl and i kind of think hau and lillie are the couple here mcs only love is bloodshed
pokemon,not_removed,not that i could find but heres the artists pokemon tag
pokemon,not_removed,yeah too bad professors are never great trainers
pokemon,not_removed,shouldnt a young burnet be at unova instead since thats her home region
pokemon,not_removed,mods said oc art only im glad they let it stay up a fair bit though
pokemon,not_removed,tfw no mriror dont even wanna spell it correctly in case someone wants to ctrlf and end up disappointing them
pokemon,not_removed,even with customable avatar we still have a default mcs appearance though in fact i like the girls so much my character is still in her default appearance d
pokemon,not_removed,main character
pokemon,not_removed,why the fuck have i not watched gurren lagaan yet
pokemon,not_removed,you dont get to be the champion of the pokemon league without knowing how to spam full restores
pokemon,not_removed,the super soaker as spoken of in legend well not really spoken more a poorly drawn picture pointed at while having tantor shouted at you
pokemon,not_removed,just buy hyper potions and a few full heals saves a lot of money for tms and clothes
pokemon,not_removed,zubat called out for help but nobody came
pokemon,not_removed,full restore main btw
pokemon,not_removed,or just a tapu cocoa
pokemon,not_removed,and its favorite cereal koko puffs
pokemon,not_removed,personnel
pokemon,not_removed,gladion will catch the legendary top lel and they will team up for a doubles battle
pokemon,not_removed,reminder if you didnt nickname name your version mascott nebby youre a terrible person
pokemon,not_removed,i need this to be a thing right now my heart please i might die from that
pokemon,not_removed,why would you give lillie a shiny abra
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,hau hugging mcs waifu really made me twitch he needs to go
pokemon,not_removed,i love the idea that it instead of stars it could be pokemon solar eclipse and lunar eclipse lack of a big legendary has me thinking it may be a big possibility
pokemon,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of years to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
pokemon,not_removed,thanks for posting these who gives a shit what the mods say every mod makes up his own retarded rule and we end up with shit
pokemon,not_removed,what the then what sub would this be able to be posted in theres no general art sub in the related subreddit page
pokemon,not_removed,the caption for the pic on imgur says boygirl mixed so youre right and it was intentional
pokemon,not_removed,while i can agree with you on the mc part i cant do that for hau and lillie because the ship doesnt allow me and because i refuse to believe that either hau loves anything else than malasadasandthathecanwinatanythinghesagainstme
pokemon,not_removed,blood for the blood god
pokemon,not_removed,mcs only love is bloodshed pokemon in a nutshell
pokemon,not_removed,i feel like hau is just a close friend to the new family of mc and lillie
pokemon,not_removed,gender neutral its very clearly a girl
pokemon,not_removed,kukui and his stealth rock roar lycanroc beg to differ
pokemon,not_removed,well of course they can be but i somehow imagine that she just wanted to become exclusively a great trainer like the mc not mainly researching
pokemon,not_removed,oh yeahtrio of fennel burnet and juniper it ishahahaha
pokemon,not_removed,these are so good
pokemon,not_removed,we dont have an actual default skin color tho we just have a default clothing set not to mention the very fact there is a gender option also already makes it pretty much impossible to have that moment
pokemon,not_removed,oh
pokemon,not_removed,blame it on the faulty education system not having seen gurren lagan is like not knowing the alphabet
pokemon,not_removed,go watch it its amazing
pokemon,not_removed,vigorous thrusting
pokemon,not_removed,and while he shouts those words you also hear a faint yet growing yell from distance towards you mmmuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrstake
pokemon,not_removed,those arent bad but when snorlax is down to hp and paralyzed those extra turns are worth every pokedollar
pokemon,not_removed,sos chaining is just the logical conclusion of the genocide run of pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,im kukui for koko puffs
pokemon,not_removed,nebula is also acceptable because nebby is the short version
pokemon,not_removed,i named mine lion after lion from hit anime steven universe fight me
pokemon,not_removed,i nicknamed him benny if they add dlc to make lillie come back or shes in ill visit the name rater immediately
pokemon,not_removed,but mufasa is all i wanted
pokemon,not_removed,i named my lunala dusky and then i got a solgaleo and named it dawnky
pokemon,not_removed,nope liono nebby was his slave name back when that crazy lady kept shoving him into a bag
pokemon,not_removed,i thought nebby was too cute so i upgraded his name with his new look so i named him chromus
pokemon,not_removed,im sorry but lunala had to be called deathstar reasons for this that insanely kickass signature move death fits the ghost typing star fits the moony spacey theme its all about no regrets
pokemon,not_removed,necrozma so far seems to be our guess at a big legendary
pokemon,not_removed,necrozma is the supposed one
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,love you too but the temporary oc rule was voted in by the community it would be silly of us otherwise not enforce it
pokemon,not_removed,there was a vote a while ago to only post oc till sm release been extended to end of november
pokemon,not_removed,well i op captioned it to make sure everyone knew the artists note is the real confirmation more adult sm pokemon character your champion mc i cant decided male or female design i should go forso i mixed them up and try to make the design can be interpret as both male and female but if i do a comic shed be a girl because i play girl mc the championd be like an npc that randomly show up in every town from no where and do all this silly part time job or shopping intensely just for the trialgoer to be shocked when met this person at the league i dont think english is their first language
pokemon,not_removed,eh i could see it going eithr way
pokemon,not_removed,its literally default girl mc look at the bonus art too
pokemon,not_removed,earthquake begs to differ
pokemon,not_removed,true and her name isnt a tree so shes not legally allowed to be a professor maybe shell be the champion in the sequel pokemon star and pokemon satellite
pokemon,not_removed,well we can always imagine burnet on vacation with her family maybe that was when she met kukui for the first time while he was running around doing trials stuff
pokemon,not_removed,relevant flair
pokemon,not_removed,pretty much i can see it happening quite easily its a beautiful day outside pikipek are singing bounsweet are blooming on days like these kids like you should be burning in the torn world
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,perfectly acceptable dont change a named pokemons name
pokemon,not_removed,i fucking will
pokemon,not_removed,my incineroar was tiger millionaire i had to name my solgaleo lion i even caught him in the pink heal ball
pokemon,not_removed,literally same i guess im not that original
pokemon,not_removed,you get a second one that you can give a dumb name you awful people
pokemon,not_removed,you get a second one you can name that doesnt already have a name
pokemon,not_removed,ah damn thats gotta leave a huge amount of quality content without a place to go especially given the brand new game release thats a pretty shortsighted decision oh well nothing to be done i guess
pokemon,not_removed,actually this makes champions in earlier games make a lot of sense like you run into steven and cynthia doing random crap all around the shop theyre actually just being pcs doing random sidequest stuff
pokemon,not_removed,im really loving the nonbinary mc they made d
pokemon,not_removed,it has the male mc tshirt under the female mc shirt and its wearing the male mc pants the hair also looks more like a longer version of the male mc hair than the female mc hair
pokemon,not_removed,plot twist her surname is palm or something
pokemon,not_removed,i mean at least a lily is a sort of plant i reckon theyd let that one slide
pokemon,not_removed,eevee used detect eevee protected itself shedinja is surrounded by its z power patient blast of justice eevee couldnt fully protect itself and got hurt
pokemon,not_removed,i actually cant fight any of you my wont let me do shit because i wont update it the price of hacks i guess
pokemon,not_removed,now thats quality naming taste right there
pokemon,not_removed,i cant understand your kanto accent did you mean p a a a a a a a a a a a l m
pokemon,not_removed,they wouldnt theres been a lot of flower characters but only trees can be professors
pokemon,not_removed,if only shedinja had poison touch
pokemon,not_removed,you should be able to update most modded
pokemon,not_removed,so far whos to say thats written in stone
pokemon,not_removed,professor burnet begs to differ though that probably means shes relegated to a secondary role
pokemon,not_removed,what if she createsdiscoveres some new kind of tree and names it the lilly tree
pokemon,not_removed,took me while to figure out what you meant by that but that would make him die to anything pretty much unless he had a boost in evasion
pokemon,not_removed,not quite on with basicsploit and exidia on a mission to get cfw back since my little bro messed up the last one update rip that
pokemon,not_removed,yeah but professor burnet is kukuis wife so her last name is also kukui

pokemon,not_removed,youre absolutely a prince among men thank you
pokemon,not_removed,some of these look fake
pokemon,not_removed,cutieflys video
pokemon,not_removed,the fish might be one of the ugliest pokemon ever
pokemon,not_removed,im in love with all seven of these designs sumo is knocking it out of the park so far i hope drampa is encountered early he shall be mine and i shall name him falcor
pokemon,not_removed,these are so fake it hurts
pokemon,not_removed,im usually open to new designs but these are so ugly especially that school bus bug pokemon drampa and tapu koko i could put up with but im just hoping these are all fake
pokemon,not_removed,so decided to give us pre gameboy colour pikachu as this gens pikachu i guess
pokemon,not_removed,newfeebas
pokemon,not_removed,both vids were removed these could be real
pokemon,not_removed,nintendo were pretty hard on leaks during gens v and vi dropping cease and desists its no wonder why they got removed
pokemon,not_removed,i wonder what type drampa will be is that a new attack or an old one with a different appearance it vaguely looks like venoshock
pokemon,not_removed,youre not missing much just some modded fake gameplay
pokemon,not_removed,you are officially the god of this subreddit
pokemon,not_removed,is that silver wind or fairy wind
pokemon,not_removed,i approve of this one
pokemon,not_removed,you need to stop perpetuating unrealistic beauty standards for marills realmarillshavecurves
pokemon,not_removed,happy pokemon day everyone like last time with leafeon i limited myself to using only the hue tool to make a new shiny — this time for game freaks favorite electric rodent and once again credit goes to uumipokemon for this idea
pokemon,not_removed,pikablueeeeee
pokemon,not_removed,rbeetlejuicing
pokemon,not_removed,aww well thank you for crediting me d
pokemon,not_removed,i think youre relying too much on bevel shading and gradients its giving youre work a very dated look and pulling it away from the colours youve chosen if you want to keep the bevel i would suggest using different bevel heights and changing the blending mode on the highlights and shadows reducing them too would be a help
pokemon,not_removed,looks really good i feel like if these were printed they would make good coins for the tcg
pokemon,not_removed,that is absolutely the coolest one ive seen yet
pokemon,not_removed,more like leaving pallet town
pokemon,not_removed,congrats
pokemon,not_removed,my school wouldnt let you walk if your cap was decorated
pokemon,not_removed,i recently made a perler pikachu and now im itching to do more did you have outlines for these and if so where can they be found
pokemon,not_removed,youre lucky my high school isnt letting us decorate our caps apparently thatd ruin the memory and classy feel
pokemon,not_removed,ive never seen anything like that before entirely original to me
pokemon,not_removed,thanks i didnt have enough colors so i made most of the bulb white and planned on paintingcoloring it but now i like it so i might leave it
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt call it bad i said slightly unoriginal because of the bulbasaur instead of a pikachu but thanks for liking it
pokemon,not_removed,i went to httpwwwspritersresourcecom and looked for the fire red leaf green sprite sheets
pokemon,not_removed,you should totes frame it or something its really awesome the way it is
pokemon,not_removed,you can get a luxio from island scan on akala island and on tuesday
pokemon,not_removed,httpwwwserebiinetsunmoonqrscannershtml
pokemon,not_removed,how are you getting rare pokemon while i have a box full of japanese abra
pokemon,not_removed,but hes not in the alola dex i thought we werent getting pokemon that belong in the national dex until january
pokemon,not_removed,yeah its not in the alolan dex but were still able to get the pokemon available from island scan
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think you undestand what anniversary from latin annus year means
pokemon,not_removed,just like brock i want to see her come back to ash
pokemon,not_removed,bring her back please
pokemon,not_removed,i miss her already
pokemon,not_removed,bring back serena bring back greninja and bring back the old animation style
pokemon,not_removed,no her arc is done dont reduce her by shoehorning her in to the next region like how brock ended fifty fifty the sun and moon style looks fine looks and moves a lot better than the last one
pokemon,not_removed,i dont like this i feel like arbitrary attributes are fine there should be room for the rng in pokemon outside of you missed so you lose over the past three gens ivs have become exceptionally accessible guaranteed ivs in chains everstone and destiny knot breeding bottlecapping iv checker on the status screen plus especially in gen ev training is basically instantaneous thered be zero advantage to this change except making casual players who will still lose all the time to experienced competitive players feel better about their playthrough mons basically what it boils down to is that i dont see a problem with pokemon of the same level with the same ev training having different statistics and would consider ensuring that all similar pokemon were actually identical a serious mistake consider beast boost for example two identically evtrained kartana may have two different highest stats giving different boosts
pokemon,not_removed,i can see it working better but wouldnt people still want pokemon with full ivs discarding those that dont meet their criteria maybe by limiting how many ivs a pokemon can have im just fascinated that i appear in that bit of the post lol i know some people dont agree with my ideas but im all out for anything that makes any pokemon able to become part of the competitive scene without needing to build a whole team around them just so they become viable i just want to see more variety than necrozma celesteela kartana tapu koko mareanie etc in the competitive scene even if im not part of it i still enjoy watching battles
pokemon,not_removed,i really like this idea ivs as they are right now are just arbitrary and worthless as a mechanic in both the casual and competitive sense in the competitive scene they form a needless wall that encourages genning while in casual play they are nearly unnoticeable it makes sense for a pokemon with a higher talentinherent ability iv to get better at that specific trait faster im not sure how noticeable it be but it definitely be at least as noticeable as ivs are in casual play as in barely it be a great method to cutting down tedium and genning while keeping individual pokemon unique that gf will probably never do it the only issue would be in creating specific ev spreads as revamped ivs can throw off some calculations they go from so how much does the ev growth change throughout this range im sure fans would find out eventually but then knowing what ivs your pokemon have would be difficult to know unless they make the iv judge more specific in that case the growths could increase in the tiers that the iv judge uses
pokemon,not_removed,i can see it working better but wouldnt people still want pokemon with full ivs discarding those that dont meet their criteria maybe by limiting how many ivs a pokemon can have with these new ivs having them not be perfect wont put you at an objective disadvantage however which is important the problem with ivs is that unless theyre perfect theyre worthless in this case theyll only effect your ev training which takes nowhere near as long as breeding the extra time lower ivs adds to it will be negligible compared to breeding
pokemon,not_removed,the contests came back in oras the underground hasnt been in the games since dppt poffin mixing might be in i didnt enjoy oras enough to check most people would recommend playing gen bw and their sequels they are actually quite good play x or y to help it tutorial you through another new region and mega evolutions and then oras for more megas primal reversions for groudon and kyogre and a journey through hoenn that most people seem to enjoy
pokemon,not_removed,oras has contests there is currently no underground bases but there are secret bases that get streetpassed around there is no cooking of any sort the pokeblock creation in oras doesnt even have a minigame what we do have is super training and amie which are both fun in their own way
pokemon,not_removed,oh god i thought this was going to turn into an origin of sandygast
pokemon,not_removed,hgsss pokéathlon and bws seasons both were enjoyable new additions that made the games more varied
pokemon,not_removed,a postagme s
pokemon,not_removed,vs seeker makes it really easy to grind and earn some cash money along the way
pokemon,not_removed,the underground in sinnoh was awesome i loved that i could get fairly decent items really early on and even fossils and evolution stones
pokemon,not_removed,the kid in me wants walking with pokémon now that its gone i feel time would be better spent with other features however i felt like it was something that should have stayed permanently especially since its been an iconic theme of the ever popular tv series
pokemon,not_removed,i want pokemon go to be fully taken over by nintendo and made into a one time dollar purchase pokewalker successor
pokemon,not_removed,how can you not have the underground on this list it was a fun feature and having an infinite source of heart scales not involving luvdisc was a plus as well as infinite fossils other than that heres my list pokeathlon seasons gym leader rematches a la gen iv possibly for trial captains and kahunas partner trainers shards for the move tutors platinum was the only game so far seals since this will most likely be next streetpass secret bases
pokemon,not_removed,i miss the seasons i really do i understand the criticism but personally it made unova seem so much more alive and that enchanced the game experience for me
pokemon,not_removed,this walking with pokémon cool seasons as much as id love to have them back alola probably wouldnt be a good fit the vs seeker gets brought up way too little it made rematching trainers so simple it was fantastic edit to is too not too
pokemon,not_removed,and had shard move tutors didnt they also sorry i forgot about the underground sinnoh is my least favorite region and i made the post while sleepy so forgot it
pokemon,not_removed,right pretty much wrapping up my first play through of soulsilver and having come fresh off of leafgreen i had never played beyond blue previously and am now playing in order i was sooooo frustrated with the method of having to make a call track them down and even then only on certain daystimes vsseekerorbust
pokemon,not_removed,didnt play so i didnt know that
pokemon,not_removed,get the shiny charm it triples your chances this is by far the easiest game to get it in especially if you use the gts do something else at the same time like watching movies or dumb youtube stuff
pokemon,not_removed,watch a movie or a show while hatching dont give up youll get it soon
pokemon,not_removed,hey if you want help with it for valentines i can help although it well have my ot unfortunately please reply ive got nothing pokemon related to do at the moment
pokemon,not_removed,the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results shiny breeding in essence is more or less the same thing except you technically will get a different result eventually probably from what i can tell the masuda method alone gives you a chance having a shiny charm as well would make this a chance id split the breeding up with trading catching or evolving just to break up some of the monotony and to eventually improve my chances but you are on a deadline as a suggestion for a combination of efficiency and onehandedness i prefer using stoutland with the settings la button mode and automatic partybox you can hold the ds off to the side while you watch netflix or browse reddit or whatever the hell kids do these days only needing to glance over to see if the lady has a new egg for you to go and mash l on which will then be dumped into the box ready for you to pick up after your current have hatched finally if your ethics allow it you can substitute or fruitless hours of hatching luvdiscs for or fruitless hours of carefully hatching and soft resetting magikarp to use and someone telling you your shiny id on rsvexchange as a shortcut
pokemon,not_removed,try tsv hatching instead much easier its not technical considered hacking as they are accepted on pokemontrades
pokemon,not_removed,its impossible you cannot keep your sanity give up
pokemon,not_removed,thanks while i really do appreciate the offer i feel it wouldnt mean as much if someone else got it for me if that makes sense
pokemon,not_removed,la is my favorite game feature i was so sad in that one i forget some game that didnt have it for some reason xd isnt sending to box inefficient time wise also yeah i was doing the stoutland thing for about eggs but i learned a simple way to rush tauros while scrolling through reddit use thumb for reddit on smartphone and middle fingernail for holding down b button xd
pokemon,not_removed,ok thats fine yeah it makes sense i understand
pokemon,not_removed,its very well done but something about the face is kinda creepy i guess its just because it has a realistic looking body and a strange cartoon face please dont take it the wrong way though its a good sketch
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,haha yeah xd i was practising to make realistic looking body but idk yet how face structure to make xd
pokemon,not_removed,in my experience if you give espeon choice specs it turns it into an offensive juggernaut pair it with stab psychic and you can ohko even most neutral pokemon if your playing competitive you can send it out as a lead with the ability magic bounce as it deters most stealth rock setups and such it even works great as late game sweeper i know you were asking for baton pass setups but from my experience this is the best way to use espeon
pokemon,not_removed,you should use the normalium z porygon set use zcoversion and it boosts all of porygonzs stats by and it changes your type to match whatever the first offensive move in your move set is my porygonz has thunderbolt to change to electric type shadow ball and ice beam for insane coverage unresisted conversion as the last move obviously more often than not this set can some teams
pokemon,not_removed,oh thats really cool ill give that a shot thanks for my current one i was going more for stab than type coverage but now that i think of it the team im thinking of could use more coverage haha what stats should i focus on for a set like that
pokemon,not_removed,speed and spatk
pokemon,not_removed,these are incredible i would pay good money for something like this
pokemon,not_removed,nice so what did your roomate evolve into
pokemon,not_removed,why is your cat not named meowtwo also those stones look bomb af great job on them
pokemon,not_removed,that last cat picture was all too relatable cats make projects involving boxes almost impossible
pokemon,not_removed,the box is just as nice as well
pokemon,not_removed,hopefully they arent radioactive like them
pokemon,not_removed,the cat is actually named mewtwo if true that is pure awesome
pokemon,not_removed,the box is smiling c
pokemon,not_removed,you are an amazing roommate those are really freaking good
pokemon,not_removed,these are sweet but i cant help but wonder what did the cat do
pokemon,not_removed,this is so cool you should try to make a sun stone next i want to try this now haha
pokemon,not_removed,really cool man thunder stone looks a bit different though
pokemon,not_removed,your suitcase has a face you should post that to the faces on things sub
pokemon,not_removed,wow those are awesome
pokemon,not_removed,use all of them on your cat at the same time to evolve it into mewthree although you might have to beat the elite four times with a complete pokedex for prof oak to give you the license that lets you use more than one stone at a time
pokemon,not_removed,why is the cat not named meowtwo
pokemon,not_removed,i wish my roommate was this awesome thats really cool
pokemon,not_removed,thought they was soap at firstit doesnt look like what it httpbulbapediabulbagardennetwikievolutionarystone
pokemon,not_removed,because all stones look the same am i rite
pokemon,not_removed,yea i had to make some compromises the facets are really hard to sand so the fewer the better so i decided to make the stones look like cut crystals then resin is stupid hard to work with let alone dying it it doesnt like to be any color other than clear and im surprised they have as much color as they do so putting those things inside was more to make sure you knew what each one was
pokemon,not_removed,aka custom silicone mold
pokemon,not_removed,down vote me all you like but can you stop
pokemon,not_removed,nah man im having fun
pokemon,not_removed,i like them keep them coming
pokemon,not_removed,thanks dude
pokemon,not_removed,why does she look so upset
pokemon,not_removed,permission to make a nebby get in the bag comment also this art is wonderful so im still contributing
pokemon,not_removed,pew intensifies
pokemon,not_removed,i see a blaziken mermaid and it is excellent very nice drawing
pokemon,not_removed,when combining artworks always take care of the line thickness thats what often gives it away and makes the pic look a bit off try tracing the lines to get them all to the same thickness other than that nice work d the arrangement is on spot and the lillie artwork is really hilarious d
pokemon,not_removed,this looks really great i wish i could do the same for my favorite team
pokemon,not_removed,this is actually my favorite lillie face heh
pokemon,not_removed,because nebbys still not in the bag
pokemon,not_removed,still wont get in the bag
pokemon,not_removed,nah thats the milotic tail and altaria fluff the blaziken is a normal one
pokemon,not_removed,wow thats awesome
pokemon,not_removed,🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
pokemon,not_removed,wow how long did that take you nice work
pokemon,not_removed,neat
pokemon,not_removed,wouldve been a if it was a blastoise
pokemon,not_removed,what an amazing end result of would have a lot of hard work have an upvote
pokemon,not_removed,awesome work id buy that
pokemon,not_removed,i would estimate about hours ive been working on it on and off for the last few months
pokemon,not_removed,i dont breed anything for this but i do sometimes use specific kinds of poké balls anything on my ingame team gets a standard poké ball watertype pokémon that arent on my team typically get dive balls bugtype pokémon get net balls and ghosttype pokémon get dusk balls electrictype pokémon may find themselves in either a repeat ball or a quick ball depending on their color scheme of course sometimes there are combinations that are too good to pass up like when i recently caught an alomomola in a love ball legendary pokémon usually get ultra balls unless i think theres an alternative that looks particularly good cresselia in a heal ball or like for some reason ive always thought the musketeers look good in time balls mewtwo pretty much always goes in a master ball if the situation comes up
pokemon,not_removed,usually everything on my team gets a different ball my starter is always in a poké ball and my second pokémon is almost always in a premier ball though that can change if the second pokémon is found a bit later than normal if two things have to get the same poké ball type ill just give everyone a twin or do half and half or put all six in a poké ball basically it has to be even
pokemon,not_removed,i generally try to use premier balls nowadays i used to go by the whole just use whats most efficient rule but ive started to fall back into the fashion over function ideal
pokemon,not_removed,premier balls
pokemon,not_removed,i try to catch everything in ultra balls luxury balls i used to catch everything in dusk balls and quick balls but the gen throw animations made me realized i really dont like either one so i stopped buying them or using them
pokemon,not_removed,if im actually gonna be passing the ball down or using the exact caught pokemon itll be a premier ball by default specific pokemon may be in a different ball beast ball for beldum line only luxury ball for shiny minior only so on and so forth im picky mons i use for passing down egg moves or other purposes where the ball isnt gonna be showing up in a battle are just gonna get ultra balls chucked at them for convenience
pokemon,not_removed,i catch all the normal pokemon i can in a pokeball unless im really impatient in which i use a quick ball or timer ball i catch all my legendariesrare pokemon with a premiere ball
pokemon,not_removed,i try to color coat sometimes but i do have my faves premier timer and dive balls are probably my top im also going insane rn bc of my smart decision to breed an hp fire contrary snivy in a friend ball hope its worth might not be at this ratee xd
pokemon,not_removed,net balls for bug and water timer ball if it took too long to reduce the pokemon hp to redyellow dusk ball for night and everything else with pokegreatultra depends on the health bar
pokemon,not_removed,i use whatever ball has the highest success rate not counting master balls with a few exceptions i try to catch tapus in a ball that fits their color scheme fast level and ultra balls for koko love and heal balls for lele repeat balls for bulu and a master ball for fini because i cant think of any other ball thats purple starters in regular pokeballs nihilego in a luxury ball and pokemon that were the stars of my team in previous games plus nebby in premier balls
pokemon,not_removed,hi pokémart yes ill take as many ultra balls as i can buy
pokemon,not_removed,primer balls on cool looking mons pokeballs on everything else
pokemon,not_removed,palkia is a dive ball i guess palkia looks really good in a premier ball i also have dialga in a timer ball and giratina in a dusk ball
pokemon,not_removed,i used to only throw ultra balls later in the game back when i only had the og sapphire then with the release of me buying moon and playing through my copy of as before i even preordered i realized timer and dusk balls were a thing a good majority of my pokémon are now in either a timer ball or a dusk ball
pokemon,not_removed,i use poké balls for most pokémon premiere balls for shinies ultra balls for tapus and legendaries and master balls for flagship monsters
pokemon,not_removed,i fucking love luxury balls idk why just something about the sparkles they give off when the pokemon comes out is just really nice
pokemon,not_removed,as of gen i have some weird concept for what pokeballs i use to catch before gen i used pokeballs based on what was going to benefit what so pokemon i caught in caves or night time were almost always a dusk ball timer ball for stalled out battles ect since gen i have been trying to catch pokemon what i feel would work best with the said pokeball animation most ghost pokemon i will use a dusk ball on since in gen the pokeball animation is a dark void and makes me imagine them stepping out of the void into battle gengar and giratina come to mind specifically with this timer ball i caught my dialga with in in diamond and again in alpha sapphire which worked out for me since dialga controls time timer ball has a bunch of clocks for the animation at the time of catching it didnt mean much just the battle was stalled and decided to use it now its for the animation my favorite pokemon i caught in love balls in gen and hgss mewtwo gardevoir absol and tyranitar are caught in love balls thankfully since pokeballs transfer over when breeding i can try and breed competitive pokemon with these to get their love ball added there was no reason at the time other than these were my favourite i wanted them in a special ball now the animation i like in gen heavy ball i used on groudon in soul silver because i had a different view of logic of the heavier the pokemon the easier it is to catch so that is true but since groudon was the heaviest pokemon at the time i thought that a heavy ball would give it a like chance of catching either way animation fits perfectly for it now i cant really think of the rest i have off the top of my head i would have to go into pokebank and previous games to see but thats what i like to stick with most legendary pokemon are caught in ultra or dusk balls with the exception of unova and almost every single one caught in timer balls lol i dont really like to use master ball except for when im being lazy and dont want to stall a fleeing pokemon and endure that battle
pokemon,not_removed,if theyre shiny or if im trying to breed for their shiny it has to match their colors or theme regular pokemon are in great balls sos chained pokemon are in ultra balls and if im too lazy i just quick ball them regular pokeballs are too basic tbh
pokemon,not_removed,im actually beginning to work on a project of having a female ha final form from each species in an aesthetically pleasing and legal ball with decent ivs and four egg moved but im very colourblind and cant really match up the balls very well on my own due to their appearance though i dont like to use ultra balls or beast balls i dont feel they go well with any pokemon ive already got an ha dex but they are almost all in premier balls or luxury balls if they evolve from happiness
pokemon,not_removed,my favourite ball is the dusk ball because i love its opening animation but its more practical to use ultra balls i dont bother with breeding and only cared about evs in gen because of our lord and saviour super training which i dearly miss i couldnt care less about natures shinnys and ivs which means dobby is freeeeeee
pokemon,not_removed,premier ball is best ball cheap awesome color scheme and thats all you need i tend to catch my favorite pokemon slakoth vigoroth in those if possible i use them on a lot of normal type pokemon now that i think of it i do try to have some sort of pokeball for each type timer balls look good on dragon types because of the ancient feel they have or when really thinking about my team i tend to use the best fitting ball for the species im going for or happen to come across
pokemon,not_removed,if im purposefully catching or breeding some pokémon for my team ill try to have it in a ball that seems fitting somehow be it because of its type colors etc in sun i managed to have each member of my team on a different ball decidueye on its regular pokeball no option here lycanroc on a nest ball the camo colors looked somewhat fitting wishiwashi on a dive ball because water bewear on a heal ball because pink shiny alolan raichu on a luxury ball happiness and also sparks galore and solgaleo on a heavy ball tried a friend ball first because of the pattern but it failed and i lost it but heavys metallic thing is fitting too
pokemon,not_removed,what balls do you use to capture each pokemon would be a rather long post lol but for a more serioussensible post most of the stuff i use regularly are just in poké balls though many of them are bred down from older pokémon so the ball mechanics werent a thing and ive generally been too lazy to bother going back or going out of my way to breed them up again when i can take a few minutes and pop out another iv one as necessary by breeding what i already have with the proper competitive stats more recently ive played a little more towards aesthetics with most of them being properly balled this gen but i really just couldnt be bothered most of the time as id rather just have fun battling didnt do much with it last gen only ones i can even remember off the top of my head is chansey because it took forever to find it to catch it in a love ball in hg and send it forward for breeding and suicune in a dive ball because that was near the end of gen but this gen ive done shiny alolan raichu in a repeat ball alolan ninetales in a dive ball though that kind of got messed up as i got lucky hatched a shiny proper iv ha on my egg while going for a normal one i like the shiny more than the normal one so im quite content with it because i dont really care for blue but it doesnt exactly fit the ball shiny magikarp and gyarados in beast balls mostly because it seems utterly ridiculous to have a magikarp which i intend to level and ev train but leave as a magikarp in one tapu fini in a dive ball because water tapu bulu in a nest ball because it seems grasslike tapu koko in an ultra ball because it matches its colors somewhat tapu lele in a heal ball because pink and i didnt want to use up my only love ball at the time as i had yet to start any of my other copies necrozma in a luxury ball because as some kind of gem stone type thing it seemed fitting gastrodon in a net ball because it rather fits both the bug and water themes of the ball as well as somewhat matching the colors of the one i already had and happened to be the one you could catch in sm that one was just in a poké ball because its great grandfather was bred in gen and its father and mother in gen where i was too lazy to go back and redo the ball alolan muk in a nest ball because it somewhat matches the colors again mimikyu in a love ball since thats what it wants slowbro in a heal ball as it matches the colors again a redo of one from the past since i could easily catch a slowpoke in it to replace its families long held poké ball toxapex in a dive ball because water and color matching ha feraligatr in a beast ball just because i could tyranitar in a moon ball because i liked the idea when i saw someone else with it had to go back to hg to do it but for once i thought it was worth it metagross in a beast ball because i could despite the nonsensical amount of tries it took and that its rather technological looking matching with metagross in theme if not in color as for the future im currently masuda breeding salandit in a love ball going for a shiny female of course going for iv too but considering how unlikely a shiny and female combined is ill gladly ht if one appears with less after that a lucario in a heavy ball arcanine in a level ball and a shiny baile oricorio in a luxury all are the only things i have planned the rest will likely just end up being in poké balls again unless i happen to come across enough caring to go back and catch something to transfer forward and breed with my current ones and theyll just join the couple dozen ive rebred for this gen which already are
pokemon,not_removed,premier ball whenever possible although i did catch all the ubs in beast balls since it made sense
pokemon,not_removed,generally i just launch whatever poké ball i have until it manages to catch the pokémon the vast majority of the time i use quick balls because theyre reliable and work most of the time when they fail i switch to typerelevant ones like net balls and dive balls then dusk balls if its night time or if im in a cave if none of those conditions are met ill just use ultra balls in most cases
pokemon,not_removed,for playthroughs i usually go for a mix of poké balls and premier balls especially in gen vivii due to the way the machine displays balls otherwise i try to use themedmatching colour balls if i really cant then i usually default to either a normal poké ball or a premier ball or sometimes use them for theming i used to use quick balls to death but ive come to sort of dislike them also i never use the master ball anymore i honestly think it looks quite ugly
pokemon,not_removed,i cant use anything but regular pokeballs i like the uniformity
pokemon,not_removed,whatever i have
pokemon,not_removed,normal ghost thats all i want
pokemon,not_removed,as a gamestop employee for the time being as i have put in my two weeks today i would have done whatever i could to not let you trade in pokemon games i will ask a million and one times of you are sure whenever anyone trades in a pokemon game it isnt worth it in the slightest both financially and morally
pokemon,not_removed,it has always been there
pokemon,not_removed,first and foremost congrats on putting in your two weeks im working retail right now while i look for real jobs and its hell a lot of the time a good chunk of my customers are great but the ones who are bad are really bad the pokemon games really were the last things i traded for that reason my store gets really slow for the month of january and all our hours are cut by about half fewer hours less money unfortunately my bills dont work the same way and i had to make ends meet the one game that killed me to get rid of was heartgold because it was my favorite in the series pearl i can pick up cheap and i didnt have any real pokemon of value on it same with white and its sequel omega ruby i hadnt even completed yet so hoopa was the only thing i really regret leaving behind y version i had just started a new save in anyhow but the thing about heartgold is that its the one game thats almost impossible to find anymore id always planned on replacing and replaying all the games i lost but its nowhere to be found a copy without the case or anything goes for over on ebay it is what it is i guess once i get a real job ill have the money to drop that kind of cash on an old game until then im working my way through hoenn and looking forward to alola
pokemon,not_removed,we have hg and ss for like bucks at my store but for some reason i can not find it on the gamestop website if you go to any gamestop ask for a transfer from another store and just tell them you know store has soul silver and heart gold and you want it transferred from there i may hate gamestop but i have always done whatever i can to help out customers even if that meant taking a new game as a return for whatever its usual less preowned price so people werent stuck trading in a game for
pokemon,not_removed,hed try to catch it thinking it was some kind of of electric type pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,an electric type sith pokemon get it pikachu gotta catch em all
pokemon,not_removed,to recontextualize the question to stay within universe how would ash ketchum think react or say to a genocidal villain like lysandre of team flare reminder he was willing to eliminate all pokemon life and the lives of humans he deemed notbeautiful
pokemon,not_removed,he could obviousy challenge him to a pokemon battle
pokemon,not_removed,i feel like ash would probably get pretty angry he has a tough time seeing things from other perspectives especially one so completely opposite his own might rant about moral rightwrong realize palpatine just doesnt care then fight him to stop him from doing any harm
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know i just dont know maby palpatine whould electrocute ash maby he would think him as real no threat whatsoever or maby he would sick the death star on him
pokemon,not_removed,the thing is i cant really imagine palpatines intentions with pokemon what he would do to them exploit eradicate traffic since ashs motives heavily revolve around the preservation and wellbeing of pokemon and their bond to the trainer its difficult to gauge his reaction
pokemon,not_removed,uh were lysandres noble intentions not a sham
pokemon,not_removed,reusable tms why does my tm bag look so empty
pokemon,not_removed,bag limit as someone who likes collecting every single item i can find in an area it bothers me when playing the old games
pokemon,not_removed,not being able to run indoors and the physicalspecial split always throw me off when i replay gen games
pokemon,not_removed,dexnav
pokemon,not_removed,the biggest one for me is the physicalspecial split mostly if i replay emerald it drastically changes how some pokemon work as a result the other one i only noticed recently fairy type i end up pausing each time i take on a clefairy in platinum now since i get weaknesses mixed up
pokemon,not_removed,flying directly to routeslandmarks
pokemon,not_removed,gen surf speed i cry everytime
pokemon,not_removed,i just want pokémon to follow me again i know itd be hard to work into sunmoon because of having to animate runningwalkingidle animations for every reasonablysized pokémon but i dunno i loved playing soulsilver because of the connection i got with my pokémon with little things like having their sprites trod along behind me and getting to take pictures with my team i think itd be fine if they put together a few animations for pokémon is they did put it in sm and just have pokémon that would be tougher to animate like legendaries or all those alolan exeggutors come with a professor oakstyle complaint message like this pokémon is too large to follow behind you its wishful thinking sure but as someone who loves pokémon for the whole experience it provides and wants to draw my team and think of little sliceoflife sorts of moments as if i were really living with the creatures and going on a journey with them those little features meant a lot to me
pokemon,not_removed,reusable tms of course but another big one is the user interface in general very much more bland and when it comes to moves you cant see the type power effect or switch the order even outside of battle for any of your moves now ive got them all pretty much memorized but it still is kind of annoying
pokemon,not_removed,fuckin running
pokemon,not_removed,registering
pokemon,not_removed,types included in future games i always forget that dark and steel didnt exist in gen
pokemon,not_removed,lets see box switchingspace bag space reusable tms move deleter berries genders breeding physspec split i could go on and on
pokemon,not_removed,the box system in gens kill me
pokemon,not_removed,not being able to go move pokemon on the pc its only little but in older games where you have to go deposit then withdraw its super annoying and having the ability to transfer to and from in the latest games is a god send
pokemon,not_removed,i actually miss the old graphics i think they just suited the game more
pokemon,not_removed,xp share
pokemon,not_removed,not really a feature but i generally tend to miss the pacing of the newer games i replayed pearl a while ago where i noticed this like really bad
pokemon,not_removed,when you use a repel and it runs out you have to stop whatever youre doing open your bag and spray another one right now im replaying heartgold and its annoying having to close the dowsing machine every time my repels run out also the fact that the dowsing machine closes if i enter a new cave area is especially annoying
pokemon,not_removed,the new teamwide exp share i never realized how much time it saved in leveling up my whole team until i started replaying emerald
pokemon,not_removed,running shoes
pokemon,not_removed,pokeballs that have different animations a little thing but its prettycool
pokemon,not_removed,walkingrunning while not being stuck on a grid basically diagonal movement
pokemon,not_removed,having to go into the pokémon menu to select a hm is really annoying that as well as not being able to assign a shortcut to the the select button edit oh and the absolutely tiny inventory
pokemon,not_removed,i have been playing platinum and oh dear god do i miss not having to go into my bag every single time my repel runs out
pokemon,not_removed,running shoes and being able to register key items physspecial split and a lot of the moves that were introduced in later gens gen movepools tend to be pretty shallow theres also the opposite to this features that id like back from those games item storage is a big one my bag is full of stuff that i dont need right now but that i might want later like all the different mega stones
pokemon,not_removed,expshare im doing a playthrough of black and i had to try times at heavy costs to defeat cheren all because most of my team was levels below his lillipup
pokemon,not_removed,gaining exp when catching the box system and reusable tms
pokemon,not_removed,daynight cycle
pokemon,not_removed,honestly i love the old games and i still play my red version every now and again but mostly every feature theyve added i love im not talking about the cosmetic things like amie or other things like berry farming but double battles abilities new types user interface improvements models free movement re applying repels different types of poke balls super training online battles internet trading these last generations are to me the way these games are meant to be played edit exp sharing registering items at once infinite tms move tutors running indoors new pokemon mega evolutions item holding etc
pokemon,not_removed,reusable tms physicalspecial split bag limit graphics
pokemon,not_removed,my playthrough of soul silver is currently missing this oh so dearly oh shadow ball oh yeahfuck
pokemon,not_removed,in my recent replay of yellow i learned that the box has a limit too i was saving all tms stat raisers calcium carbos rare candy etc and any end game items like full restores and max potions in the box and i eventually i had both a full bag and pc to deal with
pokemon,not_removed,physical special made no sense in the old days
pokemon,not_removed,this and reusable tms are the big ones for me
pokemon,not_removed,i already get dark and ghost mixed up sometimes adding fairy with a super effectiveness against dark was a lot for me to take in sylveon died in my y playthrough alot i just dont know what its good against yet
pokemon,not_removed,thats extremely practical when dealing with an important recurring place
pokemon,not_removed,diamondpearl surf speed platinum made it way faster just like it fixed all the problems everybody hated gen for
pokemon,not_removed,even in xy not being able to surf faster on sharpedo sucks
pokemon,not_removed,atleast your starters
pokemon,not_removed,as much as id like the feature back youre underestimating how timeconsuming it is to give a few hundred pokémon walkrun cycle animations game freak only has until midtolateoctober to get everything polished so id rather they focus on more important things maybe for the sinnoh remakes
pokemon,not_removed,its in there you get it in fuschia from oaks aide if you have pokemon in the pokedex iirc
pokemon,not_removed,i understand why tms are reusable now to make competitive a little easier but i thought one time tms made the play through much harder i liked the extra challenge
pokemon,not_removed,its especially painful in gen i when everyones move pool sucked
pokemon,not_removed,thats completely understandable but i would gladly give them an extra month or two to just get them to about or so of the favorites of course a lot would be left out but honestly some is better that none and they already have a few of them done seeing from the trailers where they ride on stoutland and such if they say that you will be able to be more interactive with your pokemon i want at least my starters to be following me maybe not popplio i dont want a floppy air deprived seal following me which sucks because im team popplio
pokemon,not_removed,i think hes talking about the new exp share system
pokemon,not_removed,nah its
pokemon,not_removed,yea i was meaning the new one i hate grinding in games and the new xp share would make it so much easier
pokemon,not_removed,make them go grey when used until you upgrade the tm case then they become infinate
pokemon,not_removed,i barely ever used tms ever since pokémon got decent movesets so the infinite uses actually gives me more reason to try them
pokemon,not_removed,im spoiledc
pokemon,not_removed,that could be a good way to do it make infinite a post game deal i think the mix of unlimited tm use and exp share really made the game very easy compared to gen
pokemon,not_removed,the tm doesnt even feel to be that much of a factor when you consider how much movepools have improved as well
pokemon,not_removed,i agree in some cases but limiting the amount of pokemon you can have with power moves like ice beam eq shadow ball etc will make it more difficult regardless of move set improvements
pokemon,not_removed,screenshots confirm a new plus symbol that shows something was created in sm personal competitions also allow you to restrict entry to pokemon banked from past games this points to a new pentagon rule
pokemon,not_removed,doubt it most competitions ive seen use exclusively pokemon born in gen vi games
pokemon,not_removed,in my opinion competitions would be fair for everyone if they just made it sm pokemon only
pokemon,not_removed,they made breeding way easier now so very certain your pokemon have to be native to a gen vii game for next year
pokemon,not_removed,i want the team skull style
pokemon,not_removed,i wanna do azs halfasstoss
pokemon,not_removed,i want to have a style mimicking maxie
pokemon,not_removed,i used to like the smug style i thought that meant cocky or something along those lines but then i started to see only the girls in the game using it and now im starting to think my english is not that good after all edit nvm just googled it and i was right gf really think women are cocky as hell lol
pokemon,not_removed,can i have your friend
pokemon,not_removed,wait snorlaxes can run
pokemon,not_removed,me
pokemon,not_removed,hahah glad you guys like it
pokemon,not_removed,have you not seen its zmove
pokemon,not_removed,growlithe only has toes
pokemon,not_removed,aha you seem to have had a similar idea to what i drew a few weeks ago httpsinstagramcompbgvrsmjkfek
pokemon,not_removed,lets hope iwanko evolves into something as awesome as arcanine
pokemon,not_removed,i wank oh
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,i never knew i needed this before now but i need this now i have to get both iwanko and growlithe on my team in sm
pokemon,not_removed,can confirm this is standard dog behavior
pokemon,not_removed,google images shows me it has in the front and in the back never noticed how weird
pokemon,not_removed,well what are their sets moves natures items abilities ev spreads that sort of thing
pokemon,not_removed,imho goodra it has access to type advantage moves to all of them except snorlax snorlax may take the win from goodra just because of its access to ice beamblizzard leaning towards goodra but it actually appears to be a tossup between snorlax and goodra
pokemon,not_removed,my money says snorlax one of the perks of normaltyping access to a crazy wide movepool and only fighting and ghost types have any sort of type interaction with them plus snorlax has enough bulk that it could possibly withstand a shot or two if the arcanine is running something like close combat but in a round robin scenario reddit seems to autoreverse the order of my list snorlax goodra gastrodon arcanine and i only say that because gastrodon and goodra would both benefit from some kind of rain plus gastrodon has a double type advantage on arcanine and its a fairly popular water type wall in ou if i am not mistaken then goodra can throw out a power whip or something which then leaves two relatively tanky highpowered pokes to face off against each other goodra has an edge with a couple of high powered fighting type moves that can run in either special or physical sets but ultimately snorlax would outlast goodra
pokemon,not_removed,they are all at max power any moves you want no items
pokemon,not_removed,why would snorlax ever run ice beam or blizzard when its special attacks that terrible even with max evs in special attack and a modest nature snorlax hits harder with ice punch than it does with blizzard and its not even worth it to run ice punch when stab return has slightly more base power than unstabbed supereffective ice punch
pokemon,not_removed,max power lv and perfect ivs gotcha guess no ones running hidden power then any moves you want well that basically turns each matchup into a tossup for instance whether or not arcanine can beat gastrodon depends entirely on whether or not arcanine runs sunny day and solarbeam and how goodra does against snorlax depends heavily which set they both run as seen in one of my responses below no items kinda weird item use is a huge component of competitive battling and incredibly important to the set a pokemon chooses to run unless if were to assume that this is a battle between two wild pokemon in which case tm move tutor and egg moves would need to be discounted as well and you still didnt answer my question about natures abilities or ev spreads
pokemon,not_removed,i was mentioning for overall move pool access and i forgot about ice punch so in other words you agree that goodra takes it
pokemon,not_removed,nah its pretty much a tossup either pokemon score a guaranteed with a choice band set goodra with outrage and snorlax with return goodra outspeeds but snorlax has a chance to ohko though its only a chance a choice band set on either easily beats any other set the other may run cb goodra beats curselax while cb snorlax beats assault vest goodra if they both run their alternate sets curselax vs assault vest then snorlax takes an easy win since it with return while none of av goodras moves can even and thats not even taking snorlaxs healing into account theres a lot of ways the fight can go
pokemon,not_removed,good rebuttal i can agree with that in all honesty i didnt research specific builds just went off of typing and access to type advantage moves i do see your point with the two being rather tied when choice scarfd but when bringing the buildfacts to lightsadly i would assume the lax would take the cake p
pokemon,not_removed,breloom for sure a little inch tall mushroom dinosaur that would be so cool it could sleep on my bedside table for when i was having trouble sleeping it could help out
pokemon,not_removed,a ditto no question he could transform into tiny versions of all the pokemon and other stuff too
pokemon,not_removed,meowth gotta get that payday
pokemon,not_removed,joltik
pokemon,not_removed,being realistic i think id pick porygon even though itd be tiny itd be fascinating to study a freakin sentient computer program otherwise i think id pick abra he sleeps most of the time anyways and can teleport away from danger if he could teleport something as big as me at that tiny size thatd be a big plus but wouldnt be all that necessary
pokemon,not_removed,salamence id love having a little dragon
pokemon,not_removed,always sceptile
pokemon,not_removed,well a wailord would be itd be smaller than a dolphin i mean or a flabebe at size
pokemon,not_removed,wailord
pokemon,not_removed,snorlax i could have a nice pillow i could sleep on
pokemon,not_removed,a tall mudkip
pokemon,not_removed,a alolan exeggutor will make a great green corner in a room
pokemon,not_removed,your favourite waifumon
pokemon,not_removed,buzzwole it would flex its little muscles its not legendary or mythical
pokemon,not_removed,inch tall about the size of a real bird xatu i love xatu being that its the only common pokemon that starts with x its typing and design if it werent for the future seeing thing id be down for that
pokemon,not_removed,if its small i want a smoll tyranitar or aggron or krookodile
pokemon,not_removed,i think a inch tall haunter would be cute like a little ghost buddy that i could hide in a bag or something if i needed to
pokemon,not_removed,minior would be adorable since minior is probably my favourite pokemon besides genesect shiny too because thats cuter
pokemon,not_removed,sounds like one of the old team rocket ideas for a promotion
pokemon,not_removed,puts me to mind of baby groot from guardians of the galaxy
pokemon,not_removed,a centimetertall joltik i fully support
pokemon,not_removed,you should just find a regular tick and paint it yellow tada tiny joltick
pokemon,not_removed,really bad honestly
pokemon,not_removed,heart gold i was on the elite my was abit broken because some dust got jammed in the system right when i was getting to lance my game failed it hasnt worked sense even after i got my repaired
pokemon,not_removed,i spent hours grinding in the original sapphire on victory road prepping for the elite four i got swept at some point in there and reset to avoid losing the scant few items i had i was broke ingame and i found myself standing in front of wallace not having battled him yet somehow id forgotten to save that entire time it was a long hike back to the pokemon league
pokemon,not_removed,i was playing pokemon silver when i was really young and i caught a laprass i think and i was really happy about it a few minutes later the game froze so i turned of my gameboy and turned it back on to find that my save was deleted
pokemon,not_removed,the only shiny i ever laid my eyes on was an oddish in ruby oddishs shiny looks essentially no different from the original except that it has lighter leaves i saw the stars but didnt pay attention to the leaves muscle memory said run and only afterwards did i realize i just missed a shiny pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,that sucks i had a save fail on me luckily it wasnt long after starting but it sucked nonetheless
pokemon,not_removed,oh that must have sucked
pokemon,not_removed,ah that sucks man i had saves freeze before mine once froze after the gym leader in emerald
pokemon,not_removed,well despite being similar id kick myself in your situation that mustve sucked so bad hoothoot when shiny is golden so it wasnt hard to miss lol i was so upset i had no pokeballs though
pokemon,not_removed,ive still never finished the gen remakes which really sucks because they are my two favorite pokemon games of all time
pokemon,not_removed,yeah it wouldnt have been so bad had i not ran from it of my own volition i had no one to blame but myself
pokemon,not_removed,with fake news being such a big thing now i would take this with a grain of salt
pokemon,not_removed,personally feel like this is the last gen we needed a remake of but im not nintendo
pokemon,not_removed,theres the word joke literally at the beginning of the title a few days ago it was the latin american version of april fools day
pokemon,not_removed,perhaps but thats only because of how weird it would be to do a bw remake while also taking into account
pokemon,not_removed,i really want more unova so i would be aok with more remakes
pokemon,not_removed,wait a minute tree rex
pokemon,not_removed,are you httpsimgsxkcdcomcomicscompilingpng

pokemon,not_removed,i like these ill go with melody for altaria and gameshark for sharpedo
pokemon,not_removed,kewl
pokemon,not_removed,i havent seen any other signs in the county directed at us trainers though palm bay was happy to share that city hall sacrifice park and the degroodt library are all pokestops with a gym i havent gone out to wickham to check for any mons how was it
pokemon,not_removed,tell that to the gps spoofers that grind during the midnight hours
pokemon,not_removed,only time to go to that park is after dark too hot right now out in the day light plus that sign isnt stopping anyone
pokemon,not_removed,lots of spots in the park by the time you drive around you can hit them again only place ive really gone so far and the college next door has a few
pokemon,not_removed,cocoa village is awesome for pgo i definitely recommend going there if youre looking for another fun place to go
pokemon,not_removed,the best my guess would be raichu mscizor aggron darkrai landorust and xerneas im pretty lame on that stuff so dont take it seriously thats not a creative team but these pokemon would be probably the best choices considering power alone they are frequently used already not darkrai but his dark void on smeargle surely is what are you playing singles doubles triples rotations s
pokemon,not_removed,id go snorlax scizor mgardevoir darkrai elektross xerneas
pokemon,not_removed,you forgot the best pokémon there is there was and there ever will beshuckle that said the best team would be shuckle shuckle shuckle shuckle shuckle the last slot was hard to fill but in the end i decided to go with shuckle the perfect team
pokemon,not_removed,well what is the team for beating the main story vgc or smogon tiered battle
pokemon,not_removed,those both sound fine if you just want to do casual competitive play
pokemon,not_removed,never seen this one before is it from one of the new gen vii leaks
pokemon,not_removed,i think you posted to the wrong subreddit
pokemon,not_removed,get this wrong subreddit post to fp
pokemon,not_removed,if you look closely its actually wrestle cat its trying to act cute

pokemon,not_removed,haha no i didnt do anything
pokemon,not_removed,you should prob go on rstunfisk but to me it seems like the set goes against the eve
pokemon,not_removed,well over smeargles no luck highest chain was about i think
pokemon,not_removed,i found a shiny minior when i was trying to catch a beldum all minior forms i was pretty lucky because they know explosion and i hadnt evolved my dartrix yet
pokemon,not_removed,geez thats some tough luck thats without shiny charm i hope
pokemon,not_removed,yeah no shiny charm
pokemon,not_removed,use an adrenaline orb and try to ko the reinforcement with a supereffective move you can also use something with intimidate unnerve or pressure to increase the chances of a call for help lowering the targets hp helps too
pokemon,not_removed,yeah some pokémon have lowerhigher call rates than others usually final evolution pokémon or rarer pokémon have a lower call rate dont know the exact values
pokemon,not_removed,did you adrenaline orb it and false swipe it down to hp
pokemon,not_removed,yup
pokemon,not_removed,i have claimed it thank you very much op
pokemon,not_removed,oh man ive just realized today is the last day for this poo i missed it
pokemon,not_removed,the codes stopped being given put the and expire at the end of november not the last day
pokemon,not_removed,my mistake i thought you could get them through the end of august
pokemon,not_removed,i honestly never heard the theory that the pokemon designs were supposed to be a throwback to gen i but now i see it honestly gen v is my favorite and i dont understand the hate the only thing i do hate is the timburr line get those veiny roidedup nightmare clowns the fuck away from me
pokemon,not_removed,gen used a lot of references to gen itself which invokes nostalgia gen was almost a reboot of the series trying to recreate gen without incorporating anything actually from gen which made it feel like a pokeclone game
pokemon,not_removed,i never really saw either i mean the complaint about pokemon designs in gen do have some merit a lot of them do have some fairly obvious parallels in gen but personally the gen versions seem much more pokemonlike than the gen versions did for example zubat vs woobat zubat is literally just a bat there is nothing else to it even with the introduction of crobat it is still just a plain ol bat woobat however is a bat with psychic abilities and a cute design one is just a regular animal in a video game the other seems like an actual fictional creature based on a real life animal as for gen i think the pandering was surrounded by various new additions such as pokemon amie mega evolution fairy typing and the much easier access to the meta game ultimately gen was pretty much about nostalgia and bringing back the older fans by showing them how far the series had come
pokemon,not_removed,i hated how gen never let the new starters have a chance to shine nope lets eclipse them with nostalgia fire dragon bro lets also give charizard and mewtwo two megas it was gross all the caves were straight lines no trainer had more than pokemon only new pokemon which were almost all revealed prior to release the games just kinda fall flatidk the upgraded was nice but thats about it i hate the gen pandering nostalgia aside they are the worst games
pokemon,not_removed,i dont even get this argument theyre both great
pokemon,not_removed,my issue with gen is that it didnt come close to gen or even and solo post game content in we have pwt for a fun no xp activity designed for nostalgia to beat all the major trainers of the past but then theres black towerwhite forest an area designed to give big chunks of xp to properly level pokemon with repeatable levels as well as monetary and other rewards there is also join avenue an area with every major necessity for raising pokemon in a more competitive sense in essence i have in one game all the solo content of gen with the addition of an effective means to level pokemon from eggs to of course gen has better stories imo and does a much better job telling them it just doesnt have an effective means to naturally level my pokemon against high level opponents i hope gen has an area like that maybe one where cpu opponents scale up to your level
pokemon,not_removed,ive never heard the gen pokemon being analogues to the original being used as a detriment i think the fact many people simply dont like the designs of those pokemon is the problem and its probably because the references you mentioned in gen were fairly minor im not sure how getting a lapras like you did in redblue hurt the experience and considering one of the problems people have often had with the previous few games was the over abundance of new legendaries i think many appreciated scaling that back a bit and just reusing some of the old ones
pokemon,not_removed,as someone who never played rby it didnt affect me all that much
pokemon,not_removed,i think the biggest issue with gen is that the graphics were terrible they tried forcing a world with sprites after playing gens and in the same day is the biggest eyesore and the parallel shaming is mostly because the designs were just so dumb
pokemon,not_removed,the reason i didnt like gen v was because blackwhite forced me to play with pokemon i knew nothing about without giving me an old friend to fall back on i enjoyed black much more for that reason but and horrible pacing made it an absolute drag to get through
pokemon,not_removed,ive always thought gen v was a reboot of the franchise
pokemon,not_removed,this comment of yours made me come to a interesting conclusion the people that are against gen way of doing things probably feel like gen is too unfamiliar while the people who are against gen way of doing things probably feel like gen is too familiar if you ask me im more of a fan of gen way of doing things i buy new games for new experiences and if i wanted to play old i would play a old game but i understand being too unfamiliar can feel alienating for people gen and gen are kind of a black or white way of doing things lol i think its important for future games to be more of a grey area where it doesnt feel too unfamiliar while it also doesnt feel too familiar a nice balance between the two so to say this is what i think should happen i think gen and were close to that grey area so like those games have somea lot of older pokemon available within the regional dex but mainly focus on the new pokemon then work from there to include new things to the core experience like better story aspects like bw did without feeling too handholdy while they also try to include new features like xy did while promoting those new features within the core experience thats just how i see it though
pokemon,not_removed,it made gen feel so much more refreshing to me yeah its nice having pokemon i recognize in the game but after generations of seeing the same pokemon generation after generation it was a relief to have so many new pokemon within one region the most new pokemon of any generation and it made the world feel so much more filled than any gen gamesremakes and it is better to take from by mimicking than to take from by using gen did wonderfully with how it meant to reembrace the gen feel while adding many new things to the series it feels like an actually new game as compared to the generations prior being a sequel too much water and being one of the currently worst received generationsat least how i always hear about gen on here gen was refreshing having so many new pokemon new ways pokemon interact with other pokemontriple battles the pledge moves and introducing a mechanic that made the world actually feel alive seasons changing routes in various ways made the game so much fun and can allow you to have a nearunique experience every time you play it i may just be rambling but i really love gen approach to the series it feeling so unique but still so much the same and having the darkest story out of the entire mainseries team plasma actually felt like a threat because they actually succeeded in some of their plans and their plans not being just some sort of mafia scheme plan that ultimately almost ends the world or a plan that if successful would have meant the destruction of the world in favor of a new world
pokemon,not_removed,but thats what i loved about gen because there were only new pokemon it felt like a whole new world and gave me a sense of wonderment that allowed me to enjoy the games much more than i did with gen which felt too cookiecutter now dont get me wrong i still liked both games i just think gen was an overall better experience than gen not to mention i like the updated pixel art style of gen way more than the models of gen but thats a talk for another day haha
pokemon,not_removed,but heres the thing gen use of the references ultimately made it about the references and not the region itself case in point three of the most important plot centric characters aces lysander sycamore diantha arent native to their home region whereas something limited like dp at least made it a point to have their characters aces be something thats either from sinnoh or something that evolves from something in sinnoh
pokemon,not_removed,plus the bat woobat is based on is way cuter than the bats zubat is based on
pokemon,not_removed,i liked that the dex had less pokémon personally since i felt they were all really good and unique designs i really like gen but during my playthrough i didnt use my kanto starter or any megas i only used kalos mon i actually felt the difficulty was more balanced without using a mega there was definitely some balance issues in gen with megas which made it really easy i like that they gave people the option to use old pokémon i normally like newer pokémon better when theyre in a gen with old ones i think it just comes down to preference which gen people like better
pokemon,not_removed,pardon me but at this point greninja is up alongside pikachu in terms of hype its in smash it dominated the competitive its ashs strongest pokemon ever and its beloved by pretty much everyone it smashes blastoise and venusaur into the ground in terms of popularity and gives charizard a run for his money the mega system in general addressed some concerns that gamefreak was ignoring old mons which were getting badly power creeped in gen iv and v including megas i mean they are new designs we got about pokemon total in gen in terms of gameplay the games were really easy mostly because of exp share which can be turned off but you might not have thought about it the variety of pokemon available in each route was amazing and felt irritatingly missing in oras what new designs we did get were very high quality giving us some of my personal favorites such as goodra pangoro chesnaught greninja aegislashs line and vivillion honestly i just played through gen on vc and quite frankly it was every bit as easy the only thing you had to contend with was crappier pacing irritating encounter rates and some really gimmicky ways of making the games feel difficult things you cant really outskill like poison heavy routes a broken psychic type which is difficult until you have an abra or something then its in your favor a hyper swingy crit system based onspeed and some really really bad low level pokemon design gen v was never hard nor was any gen really maybe gen and be a bit grueling especially because of the red fight x and y introduced trainer customization mega evolution theyre so cool gardevoir and gallade mega charizard x mega stoise and venusaur alakazam lucario and gyarados are all outstanding designs and more importantly they added a new dimension to the games competitive which really if you want a challenge is what should be played it also added the fairy type which had a positive effect on the meta dragons were way too good before it went out of its way to make the competitive much easier to get into making it viable for just about anyone who wants to to get perfect ivs and get competing with actual other people rather than just winning out over some perceived challenge in the main games where you can out level a computer that always does the same thing
pokemon,not_removed,the fact that i completely dunked on every gym after grants without any type advantages and next to no training didnt help my enjoyment of y
pokemon,not_removed,for me gen vi didnt offer enough new pokemon to use i only used talonflame and my starter and the rest were all old pokemon from previous generations and the only ones i would actually use were pokemon ive trained before in oras or was a complete pain in the ass to train noibat black and white didnt offer me the nostalgia fallback that all of the other games had while and fixed that the game also had some pretty ass backwards pacing making it my slowest fresh clear of a pokemon game ive ever had at just over hours
pokemon,not_removed,but they didnt is the thing a minor one is having oak show up in sinnoh once you got the national dex and some johto references not mewtwos the only other legendary besides zygarde in the game all of the old shit outnumbers the new enjoy the circlejerk
pokemon,not_removed,for its time the fifth generation looked amazing if youre playing on a it might be a stretch but it is literally being stretched out on one playing it on a dslite it looks good still i think and if you ask me it got big cities done way better than the horrificmesstonavigate that was attempt
pokemon,not_removed,i agree the pseudo just looks bad
pokemon,not_removed,tried forcing a world with sprites not gonna even touch that also design preference is completely subjective and often comes from the nostalgia goggles people hate to take off
pokemon,not_removed,really gen has my favorite art style the environments and sprites technically started in gen fleshed out to a greater style in gen the general atmosphere of the games with the colors and locations felt perfect with how dark the story was compared to all other main series pokemon games
pokemon,not_removed,yeah that makes sense for the first half of black that i played through i did resent the fact that i had to have all these new and often unattractive if were honest pokemon with me but i feel that the writing of the story eventually eclipsed that drawback and more importantly gave me the chance to develop new favorite pokemon that i otherwise wouldnt have considered using when against gfs backlog of existing creatures for what it was it was a rewarding experience but thats not going to stop me from sending some eggs of old favorites over to my white file when i get the urge to play again
pokemon,not_removed,a large number of new preferably mixed with a decent amount of old would make a perfect amount of pokemon that both contains old favorites and adds a good amount of pokemon with the new having the main focus
pokemon,not_removed,thats really the way i think about it i want the new game to have some of the old pokemon i know and love while still introducing me to the new pokemon its why i never really got into x and y so much simply because the kalos specific dex was just horribly disappointing i dont think i used a single kalos pokemon through the main story besides my starter and talonflame its just an objectively good pokemon i came to love noibat and noivern but noibat was just too much a pain in the ass to train so i put that off until the late game when i could minmax and breed a perfect timid infiltrator kalos just didnt wow me like gen ii and iii did
pokemon,not_removed,to add to that both gen and have a unique advantage of being able to feel out what they were able to get away with in newer games by having something released somewhat prior to their release gen was released just in time for that old pokemon can do no wrong feeling everyone had because just before it we were given a game with sixteen badges so we were able to take the newer pokemon and newer story order and run with it and in they were able to hear what people liked and didnt like about bw and expand on its second part that being said i think gen was just one of the better designed pokemon games just the right amount of leading the character without separate cut scenes of hand holding the player through every single town
pokemon,not_removed,and gen was able to stand on its own twice the latter more so because even with all the past pokemon the emphasis was still on the gen roster not super modes for the past pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,right
pokemon,not_removed,really plenty of bad deisgns like furfrou gogoat dedenne and diggersby gen had some poor pokemon like maractus and vanniluxe but it introduced a ton of awesome pokemon like volcorona hydreigon bisharp krookodile golurk chandelure ferrothorn and zoroark
pokemon,not_removed,i couldnt stand the overworld sprites for gen
pokemon,not_removed,that being said i think gen was just one of the better designed pokemon games just the right amount of leading the character without separate cut scenes of hand holding the player through every single town this is exactly one of the reasons gen is my favorite hoenns adventure really has a good balance between storytelling and adventuring there is story and even though team magmaaqua have pretty silly goals in rse oras kinda fixed that the actions that take part in the story makes the story feel pretty strong but that story isnt constantly in your face leaving a lot of room for exploring the hoenn region yourself one thing worth noting is sea mauville in oras i think that place has a pretty powerful form of storytelling because you discover the story of sea mauville and by extension the history of certain characters and some places outside of sea mauville by yourself by interacting with objects such as letters found there and while i say that bw gen is my second favorite generation btw has the best story of all the main series games the balance of story and adventuring the hoenn games have made it so that the hoenn games are my favorite main games i really agree with your post here
pokemon,not_removed,right
pokemon,not_removed,i dont have a problem with gen dex for the most part i actually love a lot of its pokemon i just felt like i had a hard time using a lot of its pokemon and a lot of the ones i wanted on my playthrough were at the end of the story i also felt like some of the pokemon didnt have unique designs though thats true for other gens as well i love the bottom half of unovas dex though volcarona is the best bug type to ever exist its so amazing im sorry its just my opinion i mean i actually like all the kalos designs you just listed as bad so idk what to tell you
pokemon,not_removed,gen vs highs were high but its lows were unforgivable cough gurdurr cough
pokemon,not_removed,first gen has jynx and mr mime every generation has had its share of hits and misses but none of them have produced a pokemon as fugly as those two
pokemon,not_removed,id like to first state that all gens are great so this isnt a discussion on choosing a horrible gen but more so choosing the least attractive girl in a field of models i think gen is the worst worst starters worst first route mons worst regional bug mon and its psuedo is solid but less impressive then previous pseudos and it has as many mons as gen if not more but also has far more duds gen is great in many aspects but its poke designs are lacking my grading rubric is as follows color design simple to creative combination conventionally appealing lore that meshes well with design how it meshes with prior gen staples
pokemon,not_removed,gen in my opinion too many repeats of old ideas instead of new concepts woobat instead of zubat boldore instead of graveler timburr instead of machop trubbish instead of grimer throh and sawk instead of hitmonleehitmonchan then there were also the three monkey lines which were awful in my opinion i was also not impressed with the starters
pokemon,not_removed,played every generation of games since they released in the id say the least memorablelikable for me is gen iv which is somewhat ironic as i played the hell out of diamond but hardly played and yet i liked gen v well enough
pokemon,not_removed,gen despite a few great ones theres a lot of bad ones followed by gen voltorb if he came out in later gens everyone would have cried uncreative jynx mr mime seel literally a seal named seel muk and others that im not crazy about
pokemon,not_removed,dppt honestly i know im probably going to get a lot of flack for this but i really didnt like most of the designs from that game which is wild to say because it was one of my favorite regions i did like a handful of the early mons bidoof starly shinx but aside from them and like chatot i didnt really like the vast majority of gen mons
pokemon,not_removed,has got to be gen to me its the one that hasnt aged well both gameplay wise and design wise sure theres a few great ones in gen but more than half of the dex is either reused designs copypaste animals or bland takes on interesting concepts
pokemon,not_removed,gen theres a handful that i really like giratina spiritomb toxicroak but theres a lot that just look kind of busy and awkward to me floatzel purrugly carnivine lopunny gastrodon ryperior electivire
pokemon,not_removed,gen ivwhich is kind of ironic as diamond pearl are the bestmost fun gameplay wise to me its not even so much the designs themselves even as the fact that sugimoris art style had fully shifted to a more plasticcy feeling art style where i swear to god everything was full of random circles and stuff that made them not really seem like fluid living creatures to meluckily the art style became significantly better at that in xy that said its also the gen that gave out a lot of greatly overdue evolutionsmismagius honchkrow ofcourse less neccesary evos like rhyperiorwhom i still think is pretty cool in its own right and some more unsavourily designed oneselectivire im sorry but i cant stand it compared to electabuzz were there as well but eh as well as stuff like torterra and empoleon but compared to th other gens it has probably the least ammount of designs i particularly like a lot of people say gen v and sure theres a decent bit of filler that became pointless once the early plan gf had to make black white a reboot of sorts was scrapped which added quite a bit of pointless redundancy that probably wouldnt have been there otherwise but that said it added quite a few creative new type combossuch as ghostfire fightingrock ghostground etc and concepts as well as being probably the greatest provider of boons to the interesting but oft unexplored ghost type of any generation prior and overall the good outways the bad imo
pokemon,not_removed,ofc other gens improved gen was the first so saying its worst is kinda stupid even tho its not my fav gen its not the worst and no its not for nostalgia i get more nostalgia from gen or at this point gen is worst imo i like maybe of the pokémon release so far also gen they fucked up some evolutions and i cant remember so many of them oooops
pokemon,not_removed,i dont like most of the gen pokemon most of the designs look too simple andor very uncreative i think when they are running out of ideas that just means they have to be more creative
pokemon,not_removed,personally its either gen or the legendaries in were the worst imo zekrom is okay but the others had horrible designs gen legendaries were great though especially yveltal my main issue with these gens are that theyve made pokemon look lame if pokemon like hydreigon druddigon tyrantrum and krookadile were released in earlier gens their designs wouldve been badass instead they look disappointing
pokemon,not_removed,generation five even though it had some of the best at the same time
pokemon,not_removed,gen all the way so many bad ones that i just cant get over bad outweighs the good in my opinion this is all aesthetically but i despise seismitoad throh sawk conkeldurr garbodor mandibuzz i think the legendaries are forgettable and i hate how true the mons reflections of america are lol
pokemon,not_removed,gen what was gamefreak doing with a radioactive poop pokèmon
pokemon,not_removed,unova had the most horrible and cringy designs hands down i remember there was only a handful of pokemon i wanted from black and white cause the rest were so damn ugly looking even my starter made me wince
pokemon,not_removed,personally and i expect a lot to disagree i find the first three gens to either be not too great or not memorable then again my first game was diamond so i never really grew up with the earlier ones
pokemon,not_removed,gen honestly its the most forgettable bunch
pokemon,not_removed,gen especially thunderous landrous tornadus and the my little pony pokemon special mention includes firefighting starter bad typing instead of design snivy sassy ass oshawott otter that becomes a samuwhat
pokemon,not_removed,gen for sure and everyone would know it if it werent for nostalgia gen has my favorite designs
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know why but i think the older the better i still love imagine my love for
pokemon,not_removed,ive come to realize that gen pokemon are overall very forgettable to me which is weird but they dont click have the time its the gen i have most trouble remembering
pokemon,not_removed,honestly while it had some homeruns i have to go with low number of pokemon gave hope that they would all have good designs but the ones that did have incredible design work couldnt redeem the countless second rate ones for me am not counting megas for this
pokemon,not_removed,either or though there are pokemon i like from both zoroark is bae
pokemon,not_removed,i dont like the level design in gen
pokemon,not_removed,overall gen but i say gen for one reason aromatisse ugliest thing to ever be programmed into a video game ever
pokemon,not_removed,everything after
pokemon,not_removed,this actually probably the best way to put it when people say gen was the worst me included theyre talking about the lows zoroark is cool
pokemon,not_removed,but conkeldurr is amazing
pokemon,not_removed,is gen black and white cuz if so i completely agree
pokemon,not_removed,aromatisse
pokemon,not_removed,while unova has my least favourite beginning route mons patrat pidove it also gave us lillipup who i love so i dont entirely mind i also like purrloins design even if its not very strong
pokemon,not_removed,i think it was simply a matter of how many they pumped out for that gen they released more pokemon in gen v than any gen before or since they had some good ones from that pile but a heap of crap too
pokemon,not_removed,i agree with the starters and some of the first route pokémon patrat and lillipup i still love pidove and blitzle being forgettable but the regional bug scolipede is a beast
pokemon,not_removed,i think this is basically the problem with gen that it felt like it was kind of trying to be gen at least in terms of pokémon design on top of that a lot of the original designs like the starters and the early route pokémon werent good
pokemon,not_removed,anybody who gives you flack for having an opinion in an opinion thread can buzz off your opinion doesnt require validation from anybody personally i love gen but were different people probably different ages too which means we approached sinnoh from different angles its all good
pokemon,not_removed,im really not a fan of the vast majority of gen ivs pokemon conversely i think gen v knocked it out of the park
pokemon,not_removed,i hate to say they ruined older pokemon with the new evolutions but i do prefer the designs of the new pokemon of sinnoh and the original forms of pokemon that got evolutions except for togetic never liked it but togekiss made it both useful and cool
pokemon,not_removed,i think youre on to something gen has the most amount of crap mons in comparison to how many good ones they have outside of lucario their best designed and popular mons dont match up well against the better designed mons from prior gens i still think gen has the worst and im not even talking about vanilluxe or the ones people love to hate
pokemon,not_removed,i agree although i still like a lot of gen pokemon but pokemon like burmy kricketot lumineon shellos and pretty much half of the evolutions that they gave older pokemon dont really do it for me
pokemon,not_removed,few great ones oh ok and nope not a genwunner
pokemon,not_removed,in what way is gastrodon a busy design
pokemon,not_removed,thank you lopunny is not that good i like floatzel tho
pokemon,not_removed,busy and awkward is the best way to put it the other gens have their share of pokemon that people hate but even if mr mime and stunfisk arent the standard cool dragons that people want they can still be said to be decently designed for conveying the feeling of creepy or derp well whereas a lot of gen designs suffer from taking a simple body shape and adding some haphazard looking features that obscure the silhouette and make them forgettable and id rather have a bunch of goofy designs than a bunch of mediocre ones
pokemon,not_removed,its just my opinion i started with leaf green so im not biased against gen i just feel other gens did it better and that could definitely be just because theyve had more time to perfect the designs and experiment
pokemon,not_removed,ummm muk is a great mon
pokemon,not_removed,gen is easily the best designed gen they may have only mons but their percentile of good mons supersede most other gens
pokemon,not_removed,i will always love snivy that smug bastard 💗
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i agree i actually thought zoroark looked nice but uninspired okay i cant lie he just seemed like a perfect furry bait lucario had almost perfected the formula and zoroark completed it nintendo also pushes those two pretty hard merchwise
pokemon,not_removed,nuzleaf is cool
pokemon,not_removed,klinklang is great though
pokemon,not_removed,nuzleaf kinklang spritzle and lurpuff are awesome and bibarel is kinda forgettable but not terrible
pokemon,not_removed,i like liepard slighlty but hate purrloin myself maybe cuz im not a fan of purple on earthy mons but different strokes i suppose and i like lilipup but not much of a fan of its evos
pokemon,not_removed,for some reason i counted dwebble as the regional bug but youre right scolipede is great
pokemon,not_removed,electivire was a nice addition not that big of a fan of magmortor or rhyperior
pokemon,not_removed,i thought gen and were equally eh though i love both games but which ones in gen do you dislike for some reason purrloin irritated me but i did like liepard a bit more i think it was their color scheme that threw me off i was a total tomboy back when bw came out
pokemon,not_removed,id put him more on the awkward side
pokemon,not_removed,exactly i dont particularly care for mr mime but i get it his design is simple and to the point its the same reason i didnt mention bidoof i dont particularly like bidoof but his design is simple and to the point
pokemon,not_removed,well true but they were still creative at that time and i still find them creative but other gens perfected the designs really gen a fucking sandcastle a square bug a teddybear i wouldnt call that creative gen used a lot more animals in their designs i think thats why people dont like them
pokemon,not_removed,at the time of course it was very creative i dont know if you realised but its been years and new pokemon since then
pokemon,not_removed,yeah but the thread isnt asking how creative they were for their time its asking how much you like them now i dont see why his opinion about how they are now isnt valid because you think they were once cooler or for that matter why your opinion would invalidate his regardless of time
pokemon,not_removed,i love muks design especially when shiny amd he becomes jabba the muk
pokemon,not_removed,yeah gen was fantastic definitely my favorite houndoomour steelix crowbat heracross scizor ampharos donphan entei and lugia and more all have great designs so good
pokemon,not_removed,i dont much pay attention to that sort of stuff i just like his unique ability p
pokemon,not_removed,slurpuff is a waste of potential its a candy oompa loompa such a huge disappointment
pokemon,not_removed,its cool dude i just thought purrloin was pretty refreshing for early route mons like how poochyena was and i also love big fat dogs so i thought stoutland was pretty great
pokemon,not_removed,yeah dwebble is the regional paras spinarak nincada combee random stage bug
pokemon,not_removed,i have the exact same sentiment with purrloin and i dont like the conkuldor line the gear mons are meh at best the genies are really good in compettive and have cool forms but their normal selves are awful imo patrat and most beginning of the game mons are lacking in the design category the elemnatal monkeys for one and the starters
pokemon,not_removed,i meant perfect as in getting comfortable with how they wanted to design the pokemon not that every design is perfect its unrealistic to love every single design ever from a series with almost different creatures and even the its all subjective and gen had a pokeball upside down pokeball a pile of sludge a slightly bigger pile of sludge a mole that evolves into three more of itself and a magnet that evolves into three more of itself not what i would call creative either and there are still plenty of animals used today they just revealed a lemur and orangutang pokemon we have a hedgehog owl cat circus seel and many others i think in this instance you are being a little blinded by nostalgia pokemon has always used a mix of inanimate objects and animals
pokemon,not_removed,new mons existing is irrelevant to the originals being creative or not gen has some stinkers for sure but its not hard to see why they are one of the best designed mons simplicity is essential sometimes when it comes to designs bulbasaur for instance is sleek and holds up really well compared to gen and which popular gen mons dont you like
pokemon,not_removed,oh wow groundbreaking pokéballslimemagnet pokémon comment nostalgia my nostalgia is coming from gen and i would call it creative then they put some eyes and mouth on a pile of sludge its not just a pile of sludge but im done arguing with all these gen is so bad folksp
pokemon,not_removed,how was your argument of oh my god game freak made an insert inanimate object here pokemon they just arent as creative as they used to be any better than mine its used all the time to knock current pokemon so some older fans can feel the elitism of the good old days i also like how you just point out how my argument isnt creative enough because you have no actual rhetoric besides saying sludge is creative pokemon are still designed in a similar fashion as they have always been my point wasnt just that gen wasnt creative but also that it used simple inanimate objects along side animals i also never said gen is so bad i actually really like almost all the pokemon hell it contains some of my favorites like raichu the squirtle line and zapdosjust in my opinion its the weakest of the bunch now if you disagree thats fine but i feel you are kind of telling me im wrong which i dont like
pokemon,not_removed,all are from boosters ive picked up heres the breakdown breakthrough evolutions fates collide primal clash steam siege
pokemon,not_removed,if no one claims them then id like one im not competitive in it and i havent played in over months i simply could add to my collection but i would prefer if someone more diehard were to come along that they get them
pokemon,not_removed,i would be interested in a couple
pokemon,not_removed,im not a hardcore player either but i like to play with my kids some times id be more than happy to have one if you feel like sharing
pokemon,not_removed,are they still up for grabs
pokemon,not_removed,i would like ones too thanks in anyway
pokemon,not_removed,alrighty uimmaculatecandiru ukwakmeister umarley and i will post the codes in just an hour at precisely pst first come first serve hopefully you find this to be fair
pokemon,not_removed,my last wish for is please just take a code or two and let others have a try at the others thank you in no particular order edit jan added codes to bottom of list feb added codes feb added code mar added codes
pokemon,not_removed,id be interested
pokemon,not_removed,no the island scan lets you get some other mon httpwwwserebiinetsunmoondailyeventshtml
pokemon,not_removed,island scan pokemon lack a pokedex number similarly to greninja
pokemon,not_removed,island scan
pokemon,not_removed,oh man youre right i totally forgot about that thank you
pokemon,not_removed,no problem
pokemon,not_removed,a lum berry will activate after synchronize so that doesnt work
pokemon,not_removed,im not sure this works in sun but it did in oras and xy the effects of synchronize will still work if the kadabra is fainted and in the first slot
pokemon,not_removed,oh damn i didnt know that thanks
pokemon,not_removed,im fairly certain it does but theres been mixed reviews on this sub about it i do it regardless
pokemon,not_removed,if that does work then thats awesome haha
pokemon,not_removed,it doesnt work for the sos battles because the first slot contains the pokemon you have out in the field this still works and wild pokemon are synchronized with the fainted slot pokemon but any sos pokemon that come after are not because fainted pokemon are switcherood to the back of the party
pokemon,not_removed,i wanted to comment something but i dont think people will like it even though everyone is thinking about it right now
pokemon,not_removed,top right pic
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon have no value theres no economy for pokemon so this isnt a problem the thing to focus on are illegal pokemon moves and abilities and things that dont exist yet or at all which they have already combated with hack checks on bank and online battling which is all they need you could argue that its ruining the trading community but just as much as there is people who hack there are people who dont and will still put legit pokemon on the gts for a reasonable trade they go like hotcakes as soon as theyre up the ones that are unreasonable will most likely never get picked and this is why you see so much its relative a trading community of forums and subreddits still exist very prominently as well the only value a pokemon has is as much as you personally give to it this is from the view of someone who doesnt hackinject at all i have shinies that ive obtained all myself and i realize they have shit ivs and abilities and they have no value to anyone else but i hold so much value on them because ive gotten them all myself
pokemon,not_removed,these illegalers has been there for how many years already if nintendo still havent done anything to them i am sure by now they arent going to do anything to them also nintendo already gave the ok to illegalers back when pokemon world champs used breed pokemon from hacked parents easily seen due to pokeball nintendos reply was that as long as the stat moves and abilities stays legal anything else goes this includes removing ribbons and cloning legendaries and mysticals and placing them up on gts and wt otherwise nintendo would have already locked all nonribbon trading of legend and mysticals on gts and wt but they havent
pokemon,not_removed,as long as you are happy about getting a shiny however you get it i dont see a problem a hacked one not many will care for but if it is a legal one and you know the story about getting it it is worth infinity more its about the journey
pokemon,not_removed,for starters giving us more than one of items like apricorn balls and lucky eggs and evolution items thats why i brought a powersave in the first place
pokemon,not_removed,they need to make composing a competitive team easier they are slowly but its still really bogged down for hyper training how slow bottle cap grind is still no way to change hp or nature after the fact especially useful for legendaries particularly ones you want to maybe change sets for time machine breeding is great breeding ivs works perfectly and the rest of breeding nature ability ball is all in the mechanics the only remaining issue is legendaries we need ingame systems to let us customize attributes on legendaries we already have the iv change made things like hp fire impossibly scarce legitimately i plan to use my master ball for tapu lele to save time each reset hacked legal pokemon are not a problem they are the same as ones you can get legit gf needs to focus on making the legit method more appealing the real issue they need to fix is actual online hacking unlimited z move spam multiple megas allowing illegal movesets on hacked pokemon simple sanity checks for legality not obscure encryption for legitimacy which will always be instantly broken and a smoother path to making a legit team is what pokemon needs oh and let us hyper untrain as well on legendaries are a massive pain
pokemon,not_removed,so i believe gamefreak needs to make hackinginjecting much more difficult or better yet impossible lets get this out of the way the part about gamefreak making hackinginjecting impossible no matter what developers cannot make a game impossible to hackmodify through external software the only way that can be done is not make the game in the first place hence no players would ever hackmodify the game which then defeats the purpose of the entire thread
pokemon,not_removed,there is no possible foolproof way to prevent or permanently stop hackinginjecting thats the nature of hacking you put up security measures hackers will find new ways around it thing is their injecting of pokemon isnt hurting you as long as they arent being used competitively
pokemon,not_removed,i cant remember where i saw it but someone on here said that when victory is defined by who hacked the best pokemon and not by skill that is when i stop playing competitive pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,if theyre doing it for their own ingame team or for someone who requests it why is it an issue some people just want their shinies they dont mind how they get it edit as long as they arent going online with illegal teams or movesets i dont see it as an issue
pokemon,not_removed,you know i didnt used to mind hackers all that much until i got my first ever shiny she was a sharpedo i named selina the awe of that moment i spent about minutes just staring before i realized i could actually catch it then i hatched my first shiny eevee i didnt even realize it was shiny until i put it in the box i was in a state of wonder verdantaii the leafeon youre my fave and finally when i figured out how to iv breed my first perfect pokémon an alolan ninetales with and in attack just the way i wanted her it truly is a bonding experience to catch your shinies and breed for ivs because it does take time and its your time so i guess i still dont really care if you hack pokémon but personally i dont want anything to do with it because i like legit pokémon better they have a history and all hacked mons have is a manipulated code
pokemon,not_removed,if theres one thing i can guarantee you is that its only the small amount of hackers doing any of that most will only keep it contained to offline eitherway its impossible to make something foolproof people will always find a way just like they did with the magic of just having steel diver and tloz four swords aniversary edition or etc to get into the innerworkings of a to downgrade it
pokemon,not_removed,if they arent using them for competitive its not a problem i just starting using pkhex today but i am keeping it strictly to the single player side if you consider that a problem for a some reason then sucks for you because its not a big deal
pokemon,not_removed,pokémon do have value thats why competitive ready moms are sometimes seen on ebay
pokemon,not_removed,thanks for being reasonable friend
pokemon,not_removed,you can get evolution items through the battle tree
pokemon,not_removed,you actually make an excellent point
pokemon,not_removed,that doesnt mean that they have value in general that just means that someone is too lazy and doesnt have the time dedication or effort to do it themselves but they have expendable money timemoney busy people who want to experience the battle scene but who cant waste time breeding or hacking also just because they are seen on ebay doesnt mean they are getting bought someone could think that its easy money and start hacking up a storm of pokes and putting them up on ebay someone sees this and just thinks wow this is a thing apparently and goes off to say to people did you know people buy ingame pokemon on ebay but they arent checking daily to see if it actually gets bought which it most likely doesnt
pokemon,not_removed,not all of them some you only get once per game
pokemon,not_removed,can i have examples
pokemon,not_removed,the most recent one i got was a prism scale in moon on eggxicutor island as a hidden item
pokemon,not_removed,according to serebii httpserebiinetitemdexprismscaleshtml you can get it through fishing and pick up not very efficient so i understand you i personally will never hack
pokemon,not_removed,trading definitely i had maxed hearts and traded my rockruff from moon to sun to evolve it to midday lycanroc and when i got it back the hearts were all reset
pokemon,not_removed,trading should do the trick
pokemon,not_removed,does poking it a bunch a times work
pokemon,not_removed,having it faint a bunch of times
pokemon,not_removed,im sorry however that is good for me so thank you ill have to give this a try soon
pokemon,not_removed,thank you
pokemon,not_removed,cuz they look mad when you do it
pokemon,not_removed,no the only way to reset affection is to trade pokemon away then trading it back
pokemon,not_removed,nope i tried that as well as pet them on the places they hated but that didnt work either
pokemon,not_removed,yeah ive been doing all kinds of things to make my experience more challenging no healing in battle not having pokémon hold items so no zmoves either exp share off grinding very little if at all my team has felt underleveled a lot and its made it a real challenge
pokemon,not_removed,no
pokemon,not_removed,if you want more ive done a lot but only from gen and
pokemon,not_removed,but thats actually gen version
pokemon,not_removed,i would love to hear more
pokemon,not_removed,whoops it is my bad
pokemon,not_removed,golfball pokemon confirmed evolves into plaidprint golf bag with floating nineiron arms
pokemon,not_removed,i was talking about this with a friend recently its something that seems to have gone overlooked by most im not sure if its supposed to be any kind of battle facility but its undeniably a golf course hawaii does have many and golf is a fairly popular sport in japan as well as being a fairly common holiday activity and the vacation aspect of hawaii is clearly present in alola i wouldnt be surprised if its some kind of new pokeathalon style minigame
pokemon,not_removed,what about the village in the bottom right with huge walls surrounding it
pokemon,not_removed,any speculations on those water pools in the top left corner that place looks cool but what is it
pokemon,not_removed,turned out to be a pretty useless place overall theres a trainer for the eeveeloution postgame quest as well as a tm from an elite four member and the pyukumuku minigame and not much else also the golf course is inaccessible
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon gym youll see what looks like a tiny singlehold golf course i think its just a low grass path in the end of that it has a cave over there linking with another city
pokemon,not_removed,has an ohko move called holeinone
pokemon,not_removed,im picturing something like mega alakazam except with golf clubs instead of spoons
pokemon,not_removed,or a preevolution for voltorb
pokemon,not_removed,with prankster
pokemon,not_removed,how about a flagpole pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,i really hope this is true i love me some golf lol
pokemon,not_removed,thats a separate discussion altogether but some people have speculated that its the walled city from the magearna movie
pokemon,not_removed,its almost a golf course look at how the grass has a striped pattern like in british columbia it seems too intentional to just be another route
pokemon,not_removed,oneikeet the one hole pokemon this pokemon will instinctively curl up into a ball near loud noises or deep holes it occasionally gets confused for a golf ball and becomes ferocious when struck
pokemon,not_removed,that would be pretty cool but isnt azoth a more circularpentagonal shape that picture looks like it has seven small buildings and a large one at the back
pokemon,not_removed,that actually sounds pretty cool
pokemon,not_removed,a tuuuurtle a stupid frog get off of my face ah my boy baby char stopping watching the video too much fanboyism ign
pokemon,not_removed,my introduction to the pokemon ip was red version its was confusing and overly easy with some early pokemon being very op you couldnt tell what pokemon you had in your party if you gave them nicknames because the game only had a handful of sprites its had cave full of zoobats that was much more of a challenge than the elite it was amazing
pokemon,not_removed,i had a cp caterpie inexplicably be hard to catch but other than that i have not noticed
pokemon,not_removed,ya ratattas are way too hard to catch now and the ponyta line at least is sooo far away in the battle now
pokemon,not_removed,i think they want us to buy more pokéballs because we just want xp for these low cp

pokemon,not_removed,thank you ♡
pokemon,not_removed,damn thats a pretty good scyther
pokemon,not_removed,i guess you could say the doctor said it was a no go not even sorry for that one
pokemon,not_removed,gotta sprain em all
pokemon,not_removed,that must have been one hell of a sprain ive never seen people on crutches for a sprained ankle was it bad enough that it could have almost been a tear or a break or is it just an overly cautious doctor
pokemon,not_removed,shit i bet the other girls foot is feeling it too then at least theyre young theyll bounce right back
pokemon,not_removed,waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaaaaaaaluigi
pokemon,not_removed,you should probably play the game normally and not concentrate on catching them all as that is more of your option if you want to complete the regional or national pokedexes as i have after much effort as for competitive that is once again optional and more of an aftergame thing also which games are you thinking of playing aside from sun and moon since that is a given
pokemon,not_removed,the best thing about pokemon is you can play it how ever you want catch what makes you smile build what ever team you want
pokemon,not_removed,during the first run through do it for fun catch all the pokemon that you think would be good get those gym badges and have a good time afterward you can worry about the other stuff
pokemon,not_removed,thanks i have pokemon x which was the last pokemon game i beat i was probably going to play it over since i really enjoyed the game i got really fired up watching the sun and moon trailers
pokemon,not_removed,thank you for the reply i asked so that i could guide you to evolution stone locations in case you wanted to use pokemon that evolved from such if you want aegislash mismagius honchkrow or chandelure the dusk stone is present in terminus cave in the second basement floor for gallade and froslass once you can use surf return to route and surf across the pond for the dawn stone for simisear flareon growlithe and ninetales the fire stone is located on route for vileplume victreebel exeggutor and simisage the leaf stone is located on route to the southeast beyond the hopping pillars for nidoqueen nidoking wigglytuff delcatty and musharna the moon stone is in the bottom right of reflection cave for florges and roserade the shiny stone is present on route and requires riding the skiddo for bellossom and helioptile the sun stone can be obtained in shalour city by giving a hiker the intriguing stone for raichu and jolteon the thunderstone can be found on route finally for simipour ludicolo vaporeon starmie cloyster and poliwrath the water stone can be found on route with the use of surf
pokemon,not_removed,wow that really puts into perspective how tall lysandre is hes taller than a goodra azs genes at work
pokemon,not_removed,seems like clemonts dad is also there serena sitting with sawyer 👀
pokemon,not_removed,he is fckng huuuugeee
pokemon,not_removed,lmao i watched the english dub of ashs first meeting with sawyer and it was so goddamn funny
pokemon,not_removed,where was this said
pokemon,not_removed,sounds more like wishful thinking
pokemon,not_removed,possible sure gonna happen probably not
pokemon,not_removed,just speculation there have been sites reporting that a pokemon stars version is in the works but theres no real proof
pokemon,not_removed,good digglet
pokemon,not_removed,the magikarp is hilarious
pokemon,not_removed,the hardest one
pokemon,not_removed,mareep stands out for being the first electrictype available in the game electric is a very sought after type during the early stages of a lp electrictypes are used very often in playthroughs for a number of reasons types weak to electric water and flying are very common in the earlymiddle points of the game only four types resistare immune to electrictype moves electric grass dragon and ground dragon is very rare in the game and the other types can easily be covered by other members of your team electric only has one weakness ground in addition to being the first electrictype available in game mareeps line has exceptional special attack and above average bulk for electrictypes ampharos hits hard and takes hits like a truck there are very few gen i or ii pokemon especially other electrictypes that can fulfill these roles simultaneously better than ampharos ampharos also has great coverage albeit not particularly useful to stop its counters in gs it has fire punch which was special at the time in hgss it has power gem signal beam and focus blast some other potent electrictypes are either unavailable until much later in the game raichu magneton electrode and electabuzz or are available early on but may be too inconvenient for many players to acquire jolteon lanturn tldr electrictypes are useful in the early parts of the game which makes them sought after ampharos is the earliest and one of the easiest electrictype you can acquire most electrictypes in gs and hgss are only available in late johtokanto and electric is not as great at those points so people dont seek them out ampharos special attack coverage moves and bulk are great enough for it to find a place on a team
pokemon,not_removed,mostly because mareep is available really early on compared to most electric types in the game and even then the only thing jolteon has over ampharos is higher speed and special defense in terms of movesets ampharos has a better one than jolteon in with jolteon not learning a good special electric move until much later on most of its moves run off of its lower attack stat while ampharos gets a decent amount of special moves to compliment its high special attack like discharge power gem focus blast and signal beam it really just depends on what kind of stats youre looking for really and even if you dont account for its availability and just compare it to other available electric types a lot of people like ampharos tanky stats its true that availability isnt everything i mean most earlyroute pokemon arent that good but ampharos has good stats and a decent moveset to compliment its early availability and is of a type that is otherwise hard to come by until midlate game edit i was looking at the wrong learnset for jolteon updated with more accurate information
pokemon,not_removed,consider that you get eevee at level by the time you get to goldenrod youve already beaten pokemon at level so your own pokemon are probably around there too so youll have to get levels on your new eevee just to catch up in contrast you can catch mareep before taking on the first gym and guess what type that gym is bugsys key pokemon is also weak to it so mareep earns its keep before jolteon is even available ampharos even levels up faster from level to level ampharos is slightly stronger and far bulkier than jolteon ampharos also learns new stab moves much quicker in gen ampharos learns discharge a great move at level jolteon is stuck with thundershock for another levels and the replacement is thunder fang which is weak and works off jolteons low attack stat in fact i think thundershock actually does more damage jolteon takes levels to get a worse move jolteon doesnt get thunder or discharge until the in that game which is terrible they fixed that in more recent games fortunately ampharos also gets thunder wave about levels earlier which is good for catching pokemon jolteon does get some more type variety in his level up moves but pin missile is a weak move with bad typing uses jolteons bad attack stat and is learned really late double kick is decent but again uses the wrong stat jolteon is definitely better in the levels before flaafy actually evolves into ampharos but only if you can actually level it up before that happens and once ampharos has evovled it outclasses jolteon in all but speed
pokemon,not_removed,because ampharos can easily get bulked up to high hell with def raising attacks and tank everything
pokemon,not_removed,because of how early you can get a mareep in the game
pokemon,not_removed,in terms of movesets they are roughly equal in quality levelup wise i disagree jolteon doesnt get a better electric move than thundershock until level theres thunder fang in the but its base power combined with being physical means that thundershock usually does more damage ampharos gets discharge at which is all you really need i dont think double kick and pin missile make up for the lack of useful stab especially when signal beam is only levels later than pin missile is almost twice as powerful at base and uses the better attacking stat
pokemon,not_removed,except theres the kanto region if anything the jhoto games are the best for using pokemon that evolve at a high level since theres a lot to do in those games
pokemon,not_removed,for some reason i thought jolteon got discharge earlier i think i saw its learnset and got it confused for my mistake
pokemon,not_removed,yeah thats likely happens to me a lot i was quite shocked heh when i took a look for myself
pokemon,not_removed,for some reason i thought it got thundebolt by level up its very strange that it doesnt
pokemon,not_removed,the number of pokemon to learn thunderbolt by level up is weirdly small pikachu line elekid line eelektrik stunfisk zekrom helioptile thats it
pokemon,not_removed,courtesy of uvetro
pokemon,not_removed,all of them xy and xyz are so good i cant even justify missing one episode
pokemon,not_removed,watch just the episodes after ashs fogadier evolve to greninja and the alan episodes the megaevolution specials
pokemon,not_removed,thanks
pokemon,not_removed,im starting law school in two weeks my friend no time for that or i would
pokemon,not_removed,no joke i finished xy in week and im episode of xyz around the start of my third week of watching you can do it beliveeeeee
pokemon,not_removed,i love when people claim they wanna watch something but then claim thy have no time so they can only watch the essential episodes like seriously how hard is it to make time watch one episode a day before you go to sleep or even two it wont take long for them to catch up that way but no they wanna jump right into the best episodes theres no convincing these people they think their time is valuable or something like going to law school is the end all to free time or school of any kind really if its really important they can make time watch it all from the beginning or dont even pretend to be interested
pokemon,not_removed,lmao itd be hard avoiding spoilers not the best idea for a first time watcher
pokemon,not_removed,there are far far more important things to do with my free time than watch pokemon sorry you cant see that
pokemon,not_removed,i thought you meant bulbapedia which summarizes the whole ep in detail my bad
pokemon,not_removed,pikachu youve changed
pokemon,not_removed,electricfairy basically just a tapu koko wannabe
pokemon,not_removed,i just wish that you could have an item dyed more than one color at a time and that you can keep the original white one too id gladly pay extra its so easy making money battling the elite four with amulet coin happy hour snorlax plus the treasure hunt exploration on pokepelago
pokemon,not_removed,should you need help with festival plaza related content please make sure you visit rfestivalplaza sub for help this was originally posted there and might aswell be worth sharing in the main pokémon sub hope you find this cross post useful
pokemon,not_removed,i think making the colours version exclusive was a pretty ridiculous idea why should i be denied the ability to wear blue clothes just because i got the sun version
pokemon,not_removed,one day ill get that star blue shop thanks for this really very helpful
pokemon,not_removed,i still wish that the blue dyes werent so greentinted on the other hand its great that the green and purple dyes are truer to their colours
pokemon,not_removed,you cant get dyed clothing from people on festival plaza i tried to buy a brown espadrilles and the game said its too hard to obtain not even giving a price
pokemon,not_removed,i got a red dye shop from the kind folks of rfestivalplaza let me know if any of you need it youll also need like fc
pokemon,not_removed,im so glad i finally got a red shop now i just wish i could dye my hair that red or at least a hat
pokemon,not_removed,cool
pokemon,not_removed,ugh i neeeeeed bright purple
pokemon,not_removed,is there any tutorial on this festival plaza isnt very straightforward
pokemon,not_removed,anyone here willing to trade me a liechi berry need it for dark red clothing trying to resemble lance i can trade any of the pseudolegendary dragons for it evolution form
pokemon,not_removed,yeah we should be able to buy multiple whites
pokemon,not_removed,i have a star blue shop actually if you have any idea how to meet up in festival plaza i could potentially help you out
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure the berry cost that they tell you already takes into account the berries you already have so pastel colors should take of each berry and dark colors should take of each berry and pastel blue takes oran as well as kelpsy and maranga i dont have a dye shop either so i cant check bright colors
pokemon,not_removed,my understanding is that you can only obtain bright colors by paying the fc directly not via berries
pokemon,not_removed,i can hook you up with a team purple if you have the fc required to migrate it to your plaza
pokemon,not_removed,well you participate on missions get fc and unlock shops if you are looking for a specific shop you go to rfestivalplaza and search for someone with the desired shop and add them is pretty simple though just rack up fc and thats it
pokemon,not_removed,you can buy version exclusive clothing from visitors in the plaza but theyll refuse to sell you items that they dyed at a dye house with the the message its difficult to get this item or something close to that
pokemon,not_removed,im not sure how a user can choose to suggest certain shops i always thought it was random otherwise we would probably just need to add each other and go online at the same time besides im broke on fc right now cuz i wasted it on a navy blue shop thinking it meant dark blue was availableyknow not a completely different color i was tired
pokemon,not_removed,i dont have the coin but i can grind it up whats your friens code
pokemon,not_removed,the shop that you share is the one in the first slot when you talk to the construction worker in the festival plaza
pokemon,not_removed,yours
pokemon,not_removed,wow really thank you is there a way to do the same for clothes or is that totally random
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,its probably random but im not sure
pokemon,not_removed,sorry for the delay just added you if you still need the dye house lemme know when youre able to get it and ill come online
pokemon,not_removed,ah well thanks for the info on the shops
pokemon,not_removed,im ready now if you want
pokemon,not_removed,sorry bout that you still around either way ill go online for a few hours now oh also ingame name is jonx
pokemon,not_removed,yup my name is carissa
pokemon,not_removed,cool cool im online now so lemme know when you get the dye house
pokemon,not_removed,im not seeing you
pokemon,not_removed,how about now you just showed up on my friends list if not ill try reconnecting
pokemon,not_removed,i just saw you but when i went to page you you disappeared
pokemon,not_removed,ok i got it now
pokemon,not_removed,odd ill try reconnecting now
pokemon,not_removed,oh okay enjoy
pokemon,not_removed,now to get these coins
pokemon,not_removed,gotta love the festival plaza grind
pokemon,not_removed,im currently grinding my shiny araquanid up so i can hyper train her
pokemon,not_removed,a funnier ending wouldve been greninja accidentally capturing itself with the pokeball
pokemon,not_removed,absol
pokemon,not_removed,actually contains bidoof
pokemon,not_removed,wonder if the player character would have grown too attached by then like red and his stupid pikachu which is so bad he doesnt even use it in the battle tree fite me bitch i levelled this thing to it eats pokebeans in two bites and purrs when i stroke its mane i see the appeal
pokemon,not_removed,the feels also i spot gladion being gladion
pokemon,not_removed,initial reaction aw so sweet and heartwarming spots master balldisgusting its either premierluxury or riot the only reason for this bloody abomination of pokeball to exist is so that i could catch spawn perish song lapras jokes aside this is pretty much my headcanon that andor mc sending nebby back to lillie x time later once she becomes strong trainer ps why do i feel like getting moon only to name mc lillie and then transfer post game cosmog named nebby of course to sun i mean cant change name check ot lillie check
pokemon,not_removed,just me or is the pc dressed similiar to jotaro from part
pokemon,not_removed,who spends a master ball on a pokemon with such a high catch rate
pokemon,not_removed,love how the mc is still smiling
pokemon,not_removed,lily is literally wiafu
pokemon,not_removed,w h y
pokemon,not_removed,who threw onions in my room bastards
pokemon,not_removed,why would you do this to me
pokemon,not_removed,now that i think about it i had tons of pokemon in my pc i never used i wish i could have given her some while we were in the midst of shit going down
pokemon,not_removed,now lille gets to see what it feels like to either force one of your hardworking beloved team members out of the party or boxing nebby
pokemon,not_removed,im not crying it just rained on the way to work
pokemon,not_removed,im done thanks rpokemon for helping me actually do my job today instead of browse the internet
pokemon,not_removed,mods why would you do this
pokemon,not_removed,i used my master ball on the legendary for once fucker aint getting out of that one nah only the best for the best
pokemon,not_removed,oh my god thats adorable i love it so much thats in my headcannon by the way
pokemon,not_removed,damnit im grinning like an idiot this is so sweet
pokemon,not_removed,i am not okay
pokemon,not_removed,and wound reopened
pokemon,not_removed,can we please use sumo or ms or something as an acronym instead this posts title just looksdirty
pokemon,not_removed,who caught it in a master ball ive got quick for lunala and dusk for solgaleo
pokemon,not_removed,it only makes it more tempting to pick that ball looks at my own flair
pokemon,not_removed,who wouldnt want a bidoof
pokemon,not_removed,red uses his pikachu when you fight him at the battle tree
pokemon,not_removed,its either premierluxury or riot lunala got the moon ball it deserved
pokemon,not_removed,im tempted to give a bunch of pokemon beast balls to hold trade them to a friend restart my game get all of the pokemon back and catch nebby in a beast ball style points the downside is ive already put hours into my game and im of the way towards finishing the alola dex decisions decisions
pokemon,not_removed,i had one moon ball and it caught nebby on the first try
pokemon,not_removed,not enough dolphin hats
pokemon,not_removed,ball actually has machamp oraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraora
pokemon,not_removed,those who didnt know and didnt wanna hurt nebby to catch it
pokemon,not_removed,i used a poke ball but the master ball was probably just to show that its a legendary in the ball
pokemon,not_removed,nebby deserves only the best
pokemon,not_removed,i almost did because the master balls colors look good with lunala i tend to pick which balls to use based on color more than catch rate
pokemon,not_removed,lily trigger is literally trigger wiafu trigger no period trigger combo trigger cancer achieved
pokemon,not_removed,elaborate for i am not tainted enough
pokemon,not_removed,you locked the sun pokémon in a dusk ball you monster
pokemon,not_removed,my lunala is in a dive ball the best ball
pokemon,not_removed,i liked the shimmer of the master ball on bat butt was gonna use moon ball but i dont like the color scheme on the top of the ball
pokemon,not_removed,not in the battle tree itself as an opponent though
pokemon,not_removed,where do you even get one
pokemon,not_removed,i tried that first but it didnt take so i used a premier ball
pokemon,not_removed,eyyy same
pokemon,not_removed,also the hat should fuse with the hair
pokemon,not_removed,lillie says nebby wanted to battle grow stronger and be challenged and thats why it was best to give nebby to you lillie couldnt give it the life it wanted at least not the way she was similar to your battle with tapu koko nebby fights you as a test of both itself and you moreover if you accidentally faint nebby like i did it doesnt actually faint the battle just ends and you can retry so its more like a mock battle as a ceremony rather than a real battle where people get hurt
pokemon,not_removed,got really pissed after soft resetting a bunch of times for adamantused master ballgot adamant instantly
pokemon,not_removed,i used a quick ball i didnt want to accidentally ko it but i also didnt expect the quick ball to actually work so now ive got nebby in an unworthy ball
pokemon,not_removed,accidentally kod it twice when i tried to catch it oops
pokemon,not_removed,just throw a bunch of dusk ballsultra balls you honestly dont really need to lower its hp as for not knowing its been the case since gen that cover legendaries are easy to catch youd think people wouldve caught on to a nearly year pattern by now
pokemon,not_removed,thats fair enough if you want the colour combination and dont care about the master ball it makes sense im just saying its not really needed for making things easier
pokemon,not_removed,at work on break atm so i cant really link anything but look in the dictionarywikipedia sm
pokemon,not_removed,bbut the animation makes it look like its coming out of a dimensional hole
pokemon,not_removed,it broke out of my quick ball and i dont really care for the ultra balls it was also too early for timer and i didnt really have anything else i could use that didnt break before even shaking once
pokemon,not_removed,theyre so shiny
pokemon,not_removed,i used the moon ball because i actually do like it its themed to lunala and its a unique ball for a special boy only the best for nebby
pokemon,not_removed,iirc mount hokulani
pokemon,not_removed,thats why you save before the fight and sr until it takes
pokemon,not_removed,you couldve just used an adamant synchronize pokemon then its
pokemon,not_removed,quick ball is the highest capture rate in the game besides the master ball
pokemon,not_removed,gen actually
pokemon,not_removed,or quick for the multiplier seriously it is the second best ball after the master
pokemon,not_removed,just throw a bunch of dusk balls if you play pokemon sun
pokemon,not_removed,dialga was a bitch to catch what are you talking about
pokemon,not_removed,its nebby im not taking chances
pokemon,not_removed,i just threw literally one quick ball at the bastard i knew nebby had no fight in him
pokemon,not_removed,its been the case since gen that cover legendaries are easy to catch tell that to primal groudon
pokemon,not_removed,o oh the more you know
pokemon,not_removed,i tried to use mine but i either had crap luck with the catch rate or was unhappy with the nature after hours of resets i decided to up my catch rate and reset for natures
pokemon,not_removed,i couldnt even find one
pokemon,not_removed,rofl i wishspent like hour trying to find an adamant abranever got one
pokemon,not_removed,oh i did not know that i knew it was the best to use on the first turn but i didnt realize it was that good
pokemon,not_removed,nope dialga and palkia both have a catch rate of ten times higher than the other nonshaymin legendaries in the generation shaymin has an oddly high catch rate of but other than that theyre all
pokemon,not_removed,they did that because the legendaries arent trying to kill you and want to be caught i havent played x and y but you need zekrom or reshiram to fight n and sun and moon spoilers nebby wants to be with you
pokemon,not_removed,yup
pokemon,not_removed,i bought moon to play in the dark i forgot i worked all day and only play at night my plan failed
pokemon,not_removed,the fact that its still got a times as high catch rate as the average legendary
pokemon,not_removed,you wouldnt be taking chances by throwing your other balls first
pokemon,not_removed,samesame
pokemon,not_removed,i got lucky and got a neutral nature when it did finally catch though it didnt take too many resets to work
pokemon,not_removed,you get it on the third island either found on mt hokulani or oak gives it to you
pokemon,not_removed,you couldve just used an adamant synchronize pokemon then its on finding that adamant abra
pokemon,not_removed,well technically its tied with the lure ball and beast ball both both of those only apply to specific pokemon quick ball is the most reliable of all of the balls on most early game or low leveled pokemon its a chance to catch them on the first turn at any level it catches abra without fail so its super useful for that ultra ball is capture rate quick ball is a whopping chance on the first turn
pokemon,not_removed,legendaries like palkiadialga or zekromreshiram had their catch rates knocked down to for oras but yeah pretty much
pokemon,not_removed,well yeah but i was talking about the cover legendaries games where theyre in without being the cover legendaries arent set in stone
pokemon,not_removed,girantinas got a catch rate of and hes a cover legendary from gen not sure about hooh and lugia from the remakes but i had some trouble with them
pokemon,not_removed,i mean you may be a lil disappointed because of the old formula but oras is onna my fav games and u can prolly find used versions for now so yeh why not
pokemon,not_removed,id say it is hm slaves werent too big of a deal in oras as you only need a few as far as i can recall youll only need rock smash twice you wont need cut at all you wont need fly because you get a lati that will soar you around and you may need strength on victory roadi cant remember of course youll need surf but thats a good one anyways and i believe youll need waterfall like once but its also a good move
pokemon,not_removed,as an adamant pokemon fan that has played all the games i believe sun and moon to be the worst main stream games lots of great ideas but very poorly executed oras are great but if you didnt like ruby and sapphire you probably wont like oras lots of legendaries to catch also pokemon is infamous for removing good features in the following games
pokemon,not_removed,if youre going to continue playing moon and want something to accompany it id say yes i have as and bringing all my legends over to my copy of sun was an awesome feeling theres a lot of them
pokemon,not_removed,i havent played them so i cant answer your question i actually need to ask a question of my own why are they called oras that stands for omega rubyalpha sapphire correct shouldnt it be asor alpha sapphireomega ruby greek letters or the names thereof are rarely used outside of ordering in the english language the inverted order here bothers me immensely
pokemon,not_removed,because omega rubyalpha sapphire rolls off the tongue better and because oras is a better sounding acronym than asor its really that simple
pokemon,not_removed,yeah it also goes to the lengths to relegitimize the power of groudon and kyogre after they gave more pokemon drought and drizzle in gen the delta episode is amazing zinnia is best pokemon character and probably one of the best musical themes
pokemon,not_removed,im not sure if it actually does or if we are just used to it i feel like its more because ruby and sapphire were just that ruby and sapphire the same order is still used on the remakes
pokemon,not_removed,they are the first and last letters of the greek alphabet many people in the us and europe have exposure to them because they are used in christianity as a metaphor for something that surrounds everything the text in question known as revelations was written in greek and the metaphor was never translated if translated it would be the equivalent of a and z
pokemon,not_removed,articuno zapdos moltres deino zweilous hydreigon
pokemon,not_removed,this is useful thank you now i just need to get those last flags lol
pokemon,not_removed,thats how i usually do it its not so hard to grow a couple hundred berries in a few days
pokemon,not_removed,but those lower one of your pokémons base stats
pokemon,not_removed,especially with how stupid and useless they made the former berry farm
pokemon,not_removed,i use as a reference let me know if that helps
pokemon,not_removed,super helpful thank you so much are you pretty confident thats all of them im gonna make a checklist tonight
pokemon,not_removed,ive looked at other lists and its a pretty solid list i think if you want to take account for the malefemale counterparts like nidoran f and nidoran m you have to add that in yourself
pokemon,not_removed,thanks so much for the help this is by far the most comprehensive list ive seen
pokemon,not_removed,youre welcome its definitely a good reference especially since there are other lists of pokemon that people usually collect
pokemon,not_removed,here is the whole playlist i was having a shit day and my girlfriend sent me these
pokemon,not_removed,i have very mixed feelings about this
pokemon,not_removed,thats one scary render i like what youve done so far keep em coming
pokemon,not_removed,getting evo stones most notably dusk dawn and sun i really dont want to play super training over and over again to be greeted with sorry you dont get a stone this time here have a punching bag instead
pokemon,not_removed,when people dont talk to all the npcs my niece missed all the o powers some side stuff tons of free items she doesnt talk to anyone
pokemon,not_removed,trying to enter a door on a bicycle but you just overshoot it every time making you juggle between the walls
pokemon,not_removed,hms
pokemon,not_removed,to be honest my biggest pet peeve isnt in the games but with people i hate when people say nintendo in place of gamefreak
pokemon,not_removed,at the moment peoples desire to get a douchy mcdickface rival just cuz they want to feel better about themselves by beating up an asshole rival for new games never been a fan of douchy mcdickface rivals and much prefer ones like may and wally
pokemon,not_removed,biggest peeve is long conversations held over small lines of text and having to hit a over and over its never fast enough plus having combat text split into multiple messages and having to progress through them instead of streamlining it
pokemon,not_removed,i hate it when people give their pokemon purposely ridiculous or stupid names would you name your dog after a meme would you name your cat after a reproductive organ pokemon are supposed to be like your pets and friends its hard to take anyone who does that seriously
pokemon,not_removed,when people give unnecessary hate to decent and creative pokemon designs case in point trubbish and garbodor
pokemon,not_removed,it would be less special if that makes it less special things like that whether its talking about new legends new content in general making up ideas for future stuff whatever i just dont understand when it comes down to this and to get real about it for a minjte guys you decide these things i implore you with the best intentions here dont let some video game company or some person just having fun brainstorming or posting ideas on the internet make you feel like something special to you would be any less so if such and such did or didnt happen that is entirely within your power to decide and dont let people take that from you but likewise dont take that from others too you know
pokemon,not_removed,when im fishing in a huge lake and the only possible encounters consist of three different pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,mine is more of an annoyance with the games but i really enjoy the stories and play through so when i fight every trainer and talk to every person in every building and the game story mode still only takes me hours to beat it feels like a waste because i bingeplay for days when the game comes out and then all thats left to do is level up and do battle tower type things which i get bored with way more easily shoutout to gsc version for having badges and red waiting for you
pokemon,not_removed,i have the exact same peeve regarding people assigning gender pronouns to an entire species of pokémon despite their gender ratios or if theyre simply genderless it has always annoyed me and its such a minor thing that you cant call people out on it though it only annoys me for the duration of me reading their post or listening to their sentence after that its pretty much forgotten still wish people would do it right though
pokemon,not_removed,it bothers me that the characters in the show continue to refer to all pokemon as it instead of him or herhe or she
pokemon,not_removed,im going to go off the rails and talk about the tcg im a big collector and my current goal is to complete every pokemon set released starting with legendary collection all sets have featured reverse holofoil cards some people have complete sets that feature reverse holos no stop it a reverse holo should be in its own separate subset and only the normal print should be featured to make a complete set the reverse holo set should be seen as an additional challenging set on top of the regular print the same goes for ed cards dont let me see your shadowless pidgy in your complete base set or i will give you a sour glare rant over
pokemon,not_removed,waiting for that point you get running shoes in games which have them notably leaf green you have no idea how much you appreciate running until youre forced to walk to viridian back viridian again and then to pewter
pokemon,not_removed,the elite four being just four more gym leaders youre the four best trainers of the region do something other than a monoteam
pokemon,not_removed,the removal of challenge and easy mode from after gen the games got easier and it upsets me everytime
pokemon,not_removed,alomomola this pokemon makes me livid first off the name is atrocious its a mouthful and sounds absolutely ridiculous when said aloud all they had to do to fix the name was literally just making it alomola it rolls off the tongue keeps it a palindrome and still has mola mola in the name to keep it referencing the inspired animal second off why would you add another pink heartshaped fish pokemon and not have it at all related to the other pink heartshaped pokemon already existing it just seems so absurd to have two standalone heart fish one larger and more detailed than the other but have them not evolve into each other fuck man i dont know how to handle it
pokemon,not_removed,no fucking cutscene skip this is a sin of modern gaming seriously npcs shut the fuck up and let me fight you already
pokemon,not_removed,welcome to the pokemon center
pokemon,not_removed,my biggest issue is how slow text rolls i can read fast so there should be an option that makes pressing a during text act like a slideshow without it typing out every fucking time even putting it on fast is slow
pokemon,not_removed,when i hear someone talking about pokemon or a video is titled something about pokemon and then i find out theyre talking about the anime
pokemon,not_removed,i just want to name all of my rivals is that so much to ask
pokemon,not_removed,fully evolved pokemon with less than total base stats a fully evolved pokemon below base stats is gonna have some trouble but with doubles making many pokemon more viable certain abilities and various niches to fill i can many pokemon below are viable hell a few exceptions below are ie smeargle and dugtrio but outside of that why even make pokemon like corsela and farfetchd pokemon that do not have a prayer of being used farfetchd is obviously built to have instacrits with stick a plethora of increased crit moves but doesnt have the stats to make it matter corsela is built to be a tank with moves like recover and regenerator ability but lacks the stats dunsparce could be the best abuser of serene grace b actually that one may be better off where it is point is the obviously went out of their way to think how these pokemon could be used but gave them no stats and no attention later on and it baffles me so many of these pokemon are too low for a mega to fix them and i really hope they choose to just evolve them like in gen
pokemon,not_removed,i hate pokémon fans that only like gen especially if they are arrogant andor didnt grow up with the original games
pokemon,not_removed,hms i will forever be bitter that the team i started training on leaf green when most of them where under level one was about level raised to be in their mostly by battling the same trainers on the sevii islands over and over again transfer to pearl so one of them could evolve raised them to their by battling the elite four over and over again and then transfiguring to soul silver to battle red only to find out that they cant actually battle red because none of them can know rock climb i put years of hard work into this team no other team would be nearly as satisfying to beat red with and i cant bare to split them up we were deprived of the ultimate challenge because they could learn every hm move in soul silver except rock climb every time i have to chose pokemon for a team based on what hm moves they can know i grow to have hms even more the hack checker added to pokemon bank also really annoys me but at least thats understandable you shouldnt be able to use hacked pokemon against other players and the best way to keep people from doing that is to keep them out of the game altogether it only bothers me because i had my brother hack me a few pokemon as a kid because we lived in an area where we had to get our parents to drive us minutes to another city minutes to get to an event so we only got to go if we were in that area for something anyway three of the pokemon on the team i mentioned above were hacked in using an action reply all at levels lower than ten i just wanted the joy of raising my favorite lengendaries while i understand why they dont want players to transfer hacked pokemon i wish theyd have just made it so theyre unusable again other players it makes me sad and angry that my favorite team will get left behind when i eventually send the rest of my favorites to moon
pokemon,not_removed,when people bother those who choose not to play pokemon competitively how you choose to experience something has no impact on whether or not you are a good fan you can say youre a fan of pokemon and only watch the anime you can say youre a fan of pokemon and only read the manga you can say youre a fan of pokemon and only play the video games to me the great thing about pokemon is that its a multiverse there are so many ways to experience its world
pokemon,not_removed,none of the trainers ever have pokemon apparently the reason the champion is the champion is because they are the only other person in the game who has figured out you can use more than him and magikarp guy oh my lord
pokemon,not_removed,constant interruption by npcs i skipped gen and gen so i dont know how long its been a thing but i feel like i cant walk five feet without a rival or prof or whoever chasing me down to give me a tutorial or hint or whatever early game oras is especially bad about this its really frustrating not being able to skip it when its just beginner stuff i mean im all for deeper stories and more compelling characters but having everybody i meet stop me and lecture me on the importance of loving my pokemon or how to use poke balls or whatever is not the way to do it gimme some conflict give these characters something more interesting to do than follow me around and give me key items all the time and i realize they need to make these games accessible for kids but i think they underestimate these younger kids i figured out gold and silver ok when i was young
pokemon,not_removed,the fact that trainers without full teams can still appear at end game any player that isnt utterly incompetent or running a nuzlocke will have a full team before the second gym i expect at least some competence from late game opponents
pokemon,not_removed,its that one time in oras delta episode where you fight five team aqua grunts at once horde battle style i sent out a gyrados with intimidate i believe each of them had a mightyena also with intimidate im still waiting for the battle to begin also simipour totally looks like a girl even though it is male
pokemon,not_removed,whenever i see someone on battle spot using kyogre groudon and rayquaza usually on a team with three other legendaries bonus points if theyre all clearly hacked shinies
pokemon,not_removed,the biker in rse who sees your bike from rydel and just says rydel rydel rydel rydel for like lines and you spam a to get through faster but you press a one time too many and you get another round of rydel rydel rydel rydel rydel
pokemon,not_removed,that for some reason i still have to teach flying pokemon to fly and water pokemon to surf
pokemon,not_removed,are you playing your pokingmans my parents editsome stuff
pokemon,not_removed,surfing in diamond and pearl it was just so slow ill also add wanting to do a trade with someone but because the pokemon you want theyll never give up and vice versa we both end up sitting looking at our screens negotiating for longer than it should take
pokemon,not_removed,for me its people who actually care if a pokemon is hacked or not
pokemon,not_removed,kinda similar to ops i dont like it when i see a pokemon that looks like one gender but is the other for example male gardevoirs and female machokes
pokemon,not_removed,the fact that of all legendary pokemon dont have genders if i want to give a nickname to my xerneas i have to know if its female or male
pokemon,not_removed,my biggest pet peave is that there is not a single generation where u can obtain all the pokemon to my knowledge without having to transfer from older generations i think x and y got close but not sure if you can get all
pokemon,not_removed,the animation and time when you trade pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,the battle maison i really really hate how all odds are against you i swear the number of close to streaks ive lost because of super accurate sheer colds or teams specifically chosen to counter mine
pokemon,not_removed,mainly when people say kill or killed instead of kod knocked out or fainted you dont go around and kill other peoples pets i guarantee you pokemon battles would not be legal if you went around killing wildlife and other peoples pets plus how does the pokemon center make sense then how can you just revive a dead pokemon from the dead how come pokemon like marowak die then also when people refer to the main characters as year olds none of the protagonists have ever been if you refer to the protagonists as year olds i will refer to you as a casual who only knows pokemon by the anime
pokemon,not_removed,right thats why i refer to all pokemon as xhe
pokemon,not_removed,to be honest my biggest pet peeve isnt in the games but with people i hate when people say nintendo in place of gamefreak
pokemon,not_removed,its peeves me that pokemon arent automatically guaranteed perfect ivs
pokemon,not_removed,pikachu god that fucker is annoying
pokemon,not_removed,the fact that we have no games in the orange archipelago and that its only in the anime also the fact that the battles in the anime are much more badass than in the games also that pokkén tournament is the closest thing we can get to that
pokemon,not_removed,people hating on you because you battle with legendaries i honestly dont care unless its a darkrai dark void spammer if you use a legendary in battle unless the battle was supposed to be a certain tier or have certain rules use whatever you want in battle spot or against your friends
pokemon,not_removed,anytime someone refers to all pokemon i drew every pokemon look at my weird sculptures of every pokemon etc but its really only the first
pokemon,not_removed,when trading i hate people who will give you an espeon for example in exchange for a legendary like groudon or dialga or somethingand if youre looking for a starter pretty much everyone does that well starters are pretty rare but i mean legendaries i went through so much for my cyndaquil
pokemon,not_removed,when people speculate the most farfetched ridiculous ideas based on the most shallow assumptions and then everyone acts like its confirmed god damn that shit pisses me off
pokemon,not_removed,at the moment the gts is complete garbage with so many people putting in so many pokémon many that arent even legendary almost solely for genesect and meloetta i have legitimately seen a joltik on the gts that someone would give away for a fucking genesect its goddamn ridiculous
pokemon,not_removed,pokeman
pokemon,not_removed,the cheating problem in competitive play or to be more specific the unapologetic attitudes those people take i dont care if they cheat but id like them to at least acknowledge it
pokemon,not_removed,mostly the fandom no your fan art is not good nor original then you have the people who confuse tedium for difficulty shit is so annoying
pokemon,not_removed,especially if youre forgetful and have a lead pokemon with an automatic ability weather intimidate etc and then it has to read out that line every tim
pokemon,not_removed,i replayed gen platinum recently and it took so long to run away from a wild battle that coupled with the high encounter rates made it such a slow game without repels and i have to go to my bag if i want to use a repel instead of it asking me automatically
pokemon,not_removed,we need a store that sells all evo stones its good that we have potential access to an unlimited amount of them but it should be easier than just going through super training
pokemon,not_removed,i hate talking to npcs though theyre all the same person omg i love pokémon do you love pokémon oh wow your pokémon loves you so much you have a real bond heres a tm i hate them all
pokemon,not_removed,this is basically my biggest issue with uneverthrive
pokemon,not_removed,thats my brother any time he wants to make a competitive pokemon with say focus blast ill tell him to use the tm and he doesnt have it so he has to go and get it first i swear im going to have to powersave his game to get him what he needs
pokemon,not_removed,my boyfriend doesnt explore towns or talk to npcs muchit drives me nuts i always wondered how he ended up so far ahead of me in every game and its because i wont leave an area until ive talked tobattledexplored every bit of it that i can access
pokemon,not_removed,my rule is that whenever i am playing through a pokemon game for the first time talk to the npcs if im not then ill skip around a little
pokemon,not_removed,social anxiety is a real thing even in pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,triple overshoot stop sigh heavily get off bike
pokemon,not_removed,this the only hm that is still justified is surf and thats only because of water routes lets hope that they are done away with this gen
pokemon,not_removed,i was guilty of this before i found the pokemon subreddit and was like oh game freak decides what goes in the games and stuff not nintendo
pokemon,not_removed,i hate this as well gamefreak develops the game not nintendo i also hate when people call pokemon a first party game
pokemon,not_removed,to people who say that the generation rival is the best and most fleshed out rival all he freaking does is say you suck and then say smell ya later when he leaves silver is a douchbag at first but towards the end of the game really loves his team and even tries to makeup for his crimes by returning his starter also pretty cool how his dad is the boss of team rocket wally turns from a wimp to a complete badass because his pokemon journey has matured him barry is your best friend and is always one step ahead of you not to be a douchebag but because he is such a hard worker and cares for his pokemon he helps you save the world and asks for nothing in return cheren and bianca are your childhood friends as well but each have their own personalities and make for some pretty funny dialog and yet people still think douchebag who only shows up to say hes better than you is the best rival
pokemon,not_removed,barry and hugh are to me the perfect rivals friends that share a goal with you and thus you both push each other to new heights trying to claim that goal
pokemon,not_removed,cough cough nurse joy cough
pokemon,not_removed,people calling primal dialga a primal reversion people do that
pokemon,not_removed,what there is no primal dialga we only saw normal one in dimond
pokemon,not_removed,my arcanine would have to disagree
pokemon,not_removed,im guilty of this one had my shiny dragalge that my friend bred for me named cweed and my tyrantrum trekt when nicknaming my ingame pokemon though i just dont do it if i cant find something clever or appropriate probably because i feel more attached to them
pokemon,not_removed,how do you feel about names that are essentially fancy gibberish i had a friend name an eevee dedurmbas for me for example
pokemon,not_removed,i agree with you and judging by the removed comments im the only one
pokemon,not_removed,klefkis design is brilliant when you realize that its based on a mischievous fairy who steals keys and isnt just a sentient set of keys
pokemon,not_removed,vanillites line as well
pokemon,not_removed,thats kaloss entire water system for you
pokemon,not_removed,and completing the pokedex
pokemon,not_removed,its best if you approach it as a noncommital spaz like i do its taken me a full month to get from grant to wulfric and ive still not beaten wulfric
pokemon,not_removed,its really easy to do though if you started with red and blue and got used to them not having genders if it looks masculine its a he in my head no matter what the symbol next to its name is same goes for a feminine looking pokemon because for the first thats how they all were
pokemon,not_removed,i mean genders almost kind of annoy me because if i have a masculine looking pokemon that i have a masculine nickname in my head for then i have to look for it over and over until i find a male one and vise versa with females
pokemon,not_removed,to be fair its sort of like saying hey guys it doesnt necessarily have to be said to a group of all men its just a common thing people say
pokemon,not_removed,for me its when people refer to emrakul as a he different sub but still
pokemon,not_removed,theyre actually based off of two different fish
pokemon,not_removed,yeah that would double the amount of cards you would need to complete the set just think of them like shinies just fun bonus cards
pokemon,not_removed,xy without the exp share is pretty much just easy mode
pokemon,not_removed,we hope to see you again
pokemon,not_removed,boop boop boop boop boop boop healing fanfare we hope to see you again
pokemon,not_removed,if you hold b it goes much faster i think
pokemon,not_removed,not going to lie i dislike this too i have nothing against anime in general but the pokemon anime is bad even more annoying when people think the anime has anything to do with the games
pokemon,not_removed,same it bothers me the most when they act like theyre all better than you because they only like gen and then they try to list off all the gen pokemon and end up listing off half of gen
pokemon,not_removed,i believe those people would not be considered fans at all as your quotations suggest
pokemon,not_removed,and then the top trainers only use pokemon in kalos
pokemon,not_removed,full team before the second gym my teams are never full until midlate game due to exp in the early game not being enough without grinding which is boring and monotonous
pokemon,not_removed,i only get full team midlate game i never play to catch them all i only catch the only i really like and want to form a team with
pokemon,not_removed,battled someone like this last weekend in the online tournament three shiny legendary birds a shiny groudon kyogre and a shiny rayquaza which is theoretically the only legal one since the galileo event still won and only lost one pokemon in the process which i was pretty pleased about
pokemon,not_removed,ptp just press b skips faster and you cant accidentally reply to the npc
pokemon,not_removed,i always saw it as teaching the pokémon to carry a human while doing those things like how in real life every horse knows how to walk but not how to balance and obey a rider
pokemon,not_removed,he loves playing his pikachu game dont you think he should grow up mum ive been playing my pikachu games for nine years
pokemon,not_removed,for that reason i named my female machamp brienne xd
pokemon,not_removed,alex
pokemon,not_removed,but this is a perfect opportunity tp either use the xe pronoun or make a gender up
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure you can between xy and oras also its
pokemon,not_removed,ive said died and killed as partly a carryover from when i first started when i was only a few years old didnt really understand what fainting was that young also people say that for other things too like electronics losing battery no my phone is not completely unusable but im going to say its dead and everyone will know what im talking about
pokemon,not_removed,to be fair if youre doing a nuzlocke its justified to say killed instead of fainted unless you do rematches
pokemon,not_removed,people dont mean it as literally kill it has just become shorthand for defeat in a lot of video games you dont kill other players in but you still say it
pokemon,not_removed,it wouldnt be legal to go and battle your pets either even if they wouldnt die
pokemon,not_removed,i think this is more of a habit thing since most other combatbased video games involve killing pokemon is a rare exception and its not easy to change from dead upon a victory to defeated for a single game
pokemon,not_removed,i think i used to say killed but now i just say beat em up in a stupid voice or sometimes kicked the ever living god out of them
pokemon,not_removed,im guilty of this its a habit from way back when i was a kid that i never really thought about or bothered to change
pokemon,not_removed,the main character you play as is though
pokemon,not_removed,ivs are called individual values for a reasontheyre to make pokemon as close to individuals as possible by assigning the number value differently if every pokemon was guaranteed perfect ivs then every pokemon of a particular species would be basically the same i kind of dislike the perfect math competitive aspect of pokemon but understand why theyre like that i dont think they originally intended for them to be used as a basis for hyper competitive play
pokemon,not_removed,careful on the salt for that first part there otters mostly live in freshwater agree with the second part though
pokemon,not_removed,i remember once when i was playing white i was walking through the higher level section of route and had a random double battle with two herdier and the first two pokemon in my party was my stoutland and krookodile they all had intimidate took so long to actually start the battle
pokemon,not_removed,primal groudon is the worst for this or kyogre if you bought the wrong game
pokemon,not_removed,bonus points if its shiny as well
pokemon,not_removed,this is why im not a big fan of using shiny pokemon in my crystal id rather get a regular gyarados then have the red one that wastes a second of my time i think im one of a select few that feels this way though
pokemon,not_removed,gardevoir with trace coming across a pokemon with intimidate takes forever
pokemon,not_removed,i feel compelled to talk to the npcs just as i feel compelled to check every trash can in every game
pokemon,not_removed,some of them are pretty funny though theres that maid in lumiose who loves the pillar because its thick
pokemon,not_removed,this is why i love when people give some personality or ridiculous text to npcs in rpgs really makes the game feel alive
pokemon,not_removed,yes because thats certainly what all of them say
pokemon,not_removed,to be fair i have like hours in my x and i still have to go get tms for competitive pokemon teams i wanna make
pokemon,not_removed,agreed and i deal with it myself
pokemon,not_removed,but muh fly i aint got time to bike to the other side of the region
pokemon,not_removed,and waterfall for physical water types
pokemon,not_removed,the game would be pretty boring and just wouldnt feel like pokemon without strength puzzles or having an excuse to go back and open up new paths on old routes and finding items and stuff while making room for a hm slave can be annoying hms add a huge rpg element to the game i would hate to see them go and do people not honestly use hm slaves the way people bitch about these things you would think they were running around the whole game with cut and waterfall on their main team
pokemon,not_removed,it technically is its just one of the closest nintendoexclusive ips to being a technical third party franchise edit i forgot the concept of secondparty franchises thats more what i meant to say
pokemon,not_removed,what does first party game even mean
pokemon,not_removed,id say hugh was better but only because i want to punch barry in his annoying face that may or may not be because i kept losing to him when i was but a wee lad
pokemon,not_removed,they need to make the pokecenter healing machine self service already i dont care if to people lose their jobs in each region
pokemon,not_removed,exactly we know how it works there is no reason it has to take so many lines of dialog and not go any faster
pokemon,not_removed,it was a thing in the pokemon mystery dungeon games those games are amazing and if you havent played them you should
pokemon,not_removed,okay well that one is a pretty cool but most arnt
pokemon,not_removed,thats fine it sounds like an actual name
pokemon,not_removed,i name my eevees stuff that matches their type and design say hello to rainaspiky jolteonshowersmistjapanese name and something out of a fanfic i read tronumbreon and nevilletetraeevee from the super pokemon eevee edition fangame
pokemon,not_removed,ah the projared method of naming
pokemon,not_removed,i love garbodor and vanilluxe
pokemon,not_removed,i agree up to vanilluxe that one is just two vanillish mashed together mashing two of the same thing together is lazy
pokemon,not_removed,but that was years ago surely such a long time soon more generations and more pokémon must have been enough to fix that
pokemon,not_removed,i started with rb and dont have this issue are the people who gender pokemon this way the same people who think of all dogs as male and all cats as female
pokemon,not_removed,i agree i will only have male machamps because they look like boys im not like that with every pokémon but if it looks more masculine or more feminine thats what ill call it
pokemon,not_removed,agreedas an efl teacher we always teach the kids if its an animal use it unless you know the animal pokemon should follow the same rules
pokemon,not_removed,this is pretty much my reasoning mr mine has always been a he to me because he came in red and blue where there were no genders and fucking duh the mr thing could probably throw anyone off and jynx has always been a she because fucking look at it
pokemon,not_removed,the worst is with starters and the eeveelutions theres just so many of them that look like they should be female sylveon especially but finding one thats actually female takes such a long time when the rate is only and with the starters you simply cant just use the cute charm ability to cheat your way through it
pokemon,not_removed,thats not what i mean its when people refer to gardevoir as she or darkrai as he without regard to its actual gender or gender ratio but again its not that much of a bother really
pokemon,not_removed,i guess you can find this peeve in almost every fandom it took a long time before people stopped calling jasper he as well btw nice username
pokemon,not_removed,i and some other collectors aim to complete master sets meaning that you have every normal print and every ed prints in a set its a daunting goal but one im hoping to accomplish
pokemon,not_removed,clicks a twice by mistake oh god here we go again
pokemon,not_removed,you are not ready to hear about ashgreninja
pokemon,not_removed,its not really that bad its just targeted at young kids so its simple
pokemon,not_removed,what do you mean togepi wasnt one of the originals
pokemon,not_removed,yeah the fact that gen and lower the amount of pokemon the elite four and gym leaders use confused me those gens have the most in the way of player advantage so why lower boss difficulty
pokemon,not_removed,same here except that i just want a pokemon that isnt earlygame
pokemon,not_removed,okay i get that i personally switch out four members of my team regularly just keeping my starter and a dark type ideally a sneaselweavile my personal favourites my issue is that late game trainers often feel underpowered im reaching the end of the game give me a challenge
pokemon,not_removed,thats one thing but nuzlockes arent usually what the other person is talking about usually its just replacing fainted with killed
pokemon,not_removed,that doesnt make it any less incorrect though usually i dont bother correcting people on it but it still peeves me
pokemon,not_removed,well that and the fact that dead rolls of the tongue way easier than koed or defeated
pokemon,not_removed,nope red was and theyve more or less been getting older
pokemon,not_removed,for the gen i and iii protagonists iirc gen vs were and the xy ones were somewhere between not sure about the other ones but i remember they were older than
pokemon,not_removed,how about in the delta episode when the grunts throw out mightyena
pokemon,not_removed,implied alpha sapphire is not best game you wot fam
pokemon,not_removed,you should try having to soft reset the groudonkyogre fight to get the right nature
pokemon,not_removed,i get anxiety thinking about that
pokemon,not_removed,thats the problem i think the npcs are just tmdispensing trash cans with more text
pokemon,not_removed,this its like every npc i see is a lottery ticket laying on the ground
pokemon,not_removed,i am more likely to talk to a trash can than i am to talk to an npc i dont have to
pokemon,not_removed,go fly on your freaking mega latis legendary god thing instead
pokemon,not_removed,but think about all the eggs you could hatch on the way
pokemon,not_removed,i think he meant as a hm some hms like waterfall make a lot of sense as moves or as tms but the overworld interactions feel unecessary feel free to correct me if im wrong
pokemon,not_removed,i just hate having to dedicate one pokemon in my team to be useless in battle just to have those moves
pokemon,not_removed,no its a clear example of a second party game its owned by a joint venture between gamefreak and nintendo
pokemon,not_removed,nintendo however doesnt have any stake in gamefreak pokemon though is owned by tpci which is a joint venture between nintendo and gamefreak pokemon developed by gamefreak which is a second party developer due to not being owned by nintendo pokemon is technically a second party franchise much like spyro ratchet clank and originally gears of war
pokemon,not_removed,its a game developed by a studio owned by the console maker and published by sony microsoft or nintendo pokemon is developed by gamefreak a second party developer and published by tpci a company owned by both gamefreak and nintendo
pokemon,not_removed,barry has a special place in that he was the highest leveled trainer in the games until hgss red so second strongest overall
pokemon,not_removed,but then brock couldnt ogle the nurse joys
pokemon,not_removed,what about reuniclus itscell division its literally cancer
pokemon,not_removed,but mashing three of the same thing together is magneton or dugtrio
pokemon,not_removed,the beldum line looks cool tho
pokemon,not_removed,theres actually some justification for it if you look into it apparently same with dugtrio really whack a moles rarely go solo
pokemon,not_removed,im playing through x after having finished yaround the time it came out and im half ways through as your point
pokemon,not_removed,to the non japanese im not sorry
pokemon,not_removed,i have two female dogs and still think every random dog is male
pokemon,not_removed,nah but charizard looks a hell of a lot more like a male than a milotic
pokemon,not_removed,like kevin
pokemon,not_removed,jinx cant be male though so it is always a she
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know that i would get upset with someone saying a general statement like chespin is my favorite pokemon hes so cool now if i actually had a female chespin on my team and called it a he then that would definitely be a fail on my part
pokemon,not_removed,youre the username comment ive gotten am i becoming the new uwarlizard
pokemon,not_removed,that sounds like so much work it should be a full time paying job
pokemon,not_removed,just use b instead
pokemon,not_removed,actually got into this argument one time with a friend except it was over donphan and not togepi turned into a big yelling match my fiancee finally walked in and told my friend dont fuck with him about pokemon facts hell destroy you
pokemon,not_removed,i believe thankfully gen still has elite with mons but yeah i agree if theyre gonna do this bullshit at least make challenge mode a staple edit til the unova elite four only uses mons as well unless youre in challenge mode so strange i thought it was just a kalos thing i really hope game freak stops weakening the toughest trainers in the region
pokemon,not_removed,and i feel like a lot of the more interesting pokemon are in the mid to late game
pokemon,not_removed,right i do wish there were more npcs with full teams that arent something like magikarps and a gyarados
pokemon,not_removed,well do you have a problem with saying sacrifice when switching in a weak pokemon to take a hit you arent actually sacrficing them but the essence of the act is similar
pokemon,not_removed,ah thanks
pokemon,not_removed,id like to see some sources on those numbers
pokemon,not_removed,even so i was just asking because i was confused what the problem with them being was sometimes when people make fun of pokemon they say stuff like dae you play a game where youre ten lol and i just feel like youre being insecure about enjoying the franchise lol
pokemon,not_removed,that was fun i used masquerain so for me it took even longer
pokemon,not_removed,oh yeah forgot about that that one took forever too
pokemon,not_removed,oh sorry i didnt mean to be unclear ahem omega ruby is clearly the superior version
pokemon,not_removed,does synchronize work
pokemon,not_removed,except the difference between an npc and a lottery ticket is that a lottery ticket doesnt actively try to give you and your friends paper cuts if you pick it up on the road
pokemon,not_removed,ignoring the fact that i dont have oras thats not a solution thats going to be in every game for the rest of the series
pokemon,not_removed,hms are just the easy way to prevent the player from going too far without completing the goals
pokemon,not_removed,fucking hell this in oras my water type had bloody hms to surf waterfall and dive s pain in the ass just has one hm for all water based things for god sakes
pokemon,not_removed,cool
pokemon,not_removed,welp looks like im gonna be messing with the endgame of platinum now once i get to it anyway
pokemon,not_removed,i know that would only leave every other woman on the pokeplanet for him to ogle times will be tough for sure
pokemon,not_removed,i guess in pokemon cancer is neat more of a reason to go to that world
pokemon,not_removed,dodridodridodridodri
pokemon,not_removed,thats not two mashed together metang and matagross have very unique designs the arms kinda look like beldum but thats a very minor similarity
pokemon,not_removed,i have no idea who that is or what their username refers to
pokemon,not_removed,i keep having to tell people that this is the one thing they should take my word for
pokemon,not_removed,nah i dont even have a problem with the term hm slave either since its figurative but since the game gives you a clear description of what happened rapidash fainted and even the anime goes by this it bothers me when people say so then i killed the pidgey with flamethrower again i usually dont comment on it and it doesnt bother me much when used in the context of a nuzlocke even if i dont find them appealing but by itself it peeves me
pokemon,not_removed,httpbulbapediabulbagardennetwikiplayercharactercharacters the xy ones arent confirmed but they clearly look older than
pokemon,not_removed,nah i enjoy the franchise either way but the only one whos confirmed is ash and when people make those dead jokes it just screams anime noob as in the people that only know about pokemon through the anime and probably only know pikachu charizard and mewtwo
pokemon,not_removed,i had a lvl linoone with surf it was fun
pokemon,not_removed,pirates are cooler than scientists and by that logic we can conclude that alpha sapphire is better than omega ruby
pokemon,not_removed,it seems like you havent met archie then
pokemon,not_removed,all aboard the ruby train
pokemon,not_removed,yea but i didnt have a ralts like that at the time on top of soft resetting i also didnt use my master ball
pokemon,not_removed,i like them the terrible part is that the pokemon has to delete other moves to have it it should be am ability even if the pokemon cant use it in combat
pokemon,not_removed,i honestly prefer hms fulfilling this purpose rather than a couple builder npcs sitting in the gate before each route not letting you through because theyre fixing a power outage or whatever
pokemon,not_removed,i believe he gains levels each time you beat the rematches until his starter caps at
pokemon,not_removed,maybe lance armstrong would have testicles if he lived in kanto
pokemon,not_removed,thats only doduos though
pokemon,not_removed,actually it says in the pokedex that beldum evolves when two of them come together and that metang is two beldums
pokemon,not_removed,well sorry it bothers u
pokemon,not_removed,i clicked on a couple ethan had no number calem had no number brendan had a number with a tool tip i couldnt read on mobile and hilberts had the vague i found a very loose citation in hilberts trivia saying the number was from an interview and brendans tool tip might have been a solid citation i cannot know but other than that youre throwing out some hard numbers without solid citations im not saying the protagonists are but saying xy is is especially egregious when you have no source serena has nearly the same proportions as may and may is supposedly
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i know a lot of people who only know the starters and first gen things here and there i just always assumed all of the protagonists are just out of laziness tbh never got too into the story and characters of the games or the show
pokemon,not_removed,but can pirates do this
pokemon,not_removed,science electric pirates water checkmate
pokemon,not_removed,but team aqua acts so stupid i cant take them even remotely seriously
pokemon,not_removed,just because the power is out should not mean i cant go that way my fire types can light the way thx ugh sinnoh and kalos
pokemon,not_removed,he would have never been a pro cyclist though bikes are an extremely expensive hobby over there
pokemon,not_removed,but thats still dodo heads
pokemon,not_removed,and metagross is fourtwo metangs
pokemon,not_removed,no need to be sorry i just commented here to kinda vent since thats what the thread was for i generally dont care enough to correct people either way so its not like it matters
pokemon,not_removed,xy is in game emma is and refers to you as her senior
pokemon,not_removed,ethan had no number i think gen ii and ivs protagonists are the only ones without ages attached but it would be pretty weird if they went younger than considering gschgsss relationship with rbyfrlg just my opinion on that i have nothing for gen ivs protagonists but unconfirmed doesnt specifically mean any number so we cant technically name an age hilberts had the vague wherever the ages were confirmed from theyre still confirmed if its the only thing we have to go off of then its best to go off that rather than an unofficial number assigned to a noncanon character ash also a lot of people have agreed that hilberthilda look older than most protagonists as for calem and serena ignoring proportions do they really look younger than the other protagonists to you they look like teenagers to me plus xy and oras use the same engine how come calem and serena are taller than brendan and may brendan and may have to often look up when talking whereas calem and serena are mostly eye level i wouldnt say their ages are the same at all in fact iirc emma from xys postgame was said to be near the protagonists age and shes confirmed even with the unconfirmed ages you cant necessarily say theyre if their ages are unconfirmed so i still think that joke is stupid
pokemon,not_removed,holy balls
pokemon,not_removed,what the hell did i just watch
pokemon,not_removed,were talking types now how about kyogre vs groudon kyogre wins p
pokemon,not_removed,pulls out syringe now is not the time to use that
pokemon,not_removed,but this is rpokemon not ranimals
pokemon,not_removed,wouldnt it be metangs
pokemon,not_removed,emmas age is confirmed ingame yes thank you all i want is a verifiable source on the ages
pokemon,not_removed,even with the unconfirmed ages you cant necessarily say theyre if their ages are unconfirmed i dont know why youre trying to argue with me that the protagonists arent ten when i literally said im not saying theyre ten what im saying is that youre trying to ascribe hard numbers to characters that have no hard numbers canonically attached based on how they look to you which would be problematic even if we werent working off of an art style thats already very vague to begin with bulbapedia doesnt even have links to most citations most scholars consider wikipedia to be a poor source and that site actually tracks its citations as for gen v im by no means saying the famitsu interview isnt a good source what i am saying however is an article that says they said this in famitsu without so much a link to said interview is not in the real world a good source
pokemon,not_removed,hurricane balls
pokemon,not_removed,desolate land makes your wimpy water sizzle away
pokemon,not_removed,primal groudon actually wins as his ability renders water type attacks useless
pokemon,not_removed,lance used performance enhancing drug the size of his balls harshly fell
pokemon,not_removed,damn it i thought i didnt need to check the pokedex to correct myself
pokemon,not_removed,yup by looker shes confirmed so shes our best gauge
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know why youre trying to argue with me that the protagonists arent ten when i literally said im not saying theyre ten im not trying to argue with you specifically im just not a fan of the overplayed yaer olsd cathcing gods lol thing i dont want to start an argument so it may be best to end this here what im saying is that youre trying to ascribe hard numbers to characters that have no hard numbers canonically attached based on how they look to you are you implying theyre though because if the first games protagonist werent that and they have a pattern of going upwards then i doubt it hard numbers or not the year olds thing is mostly false purely based on the fact that half the protagonists are not in fact and have confirmed ages which i previously explained in my previous post only gens protagonists have a chance to be so my point about that joke is still valid either way and yes i understand your post wasnt about the protagonists being but mine was bulbapedia doesnt even have links to most citations most scholars consider wikipedia to be a poor source and that site actually tracks its citations talking about not citing statement doesnt cite statement in all seriousness though whether or not fan wikis are official or actual wiki is its kinda the closet thing there is to it do you think the official website has a list of all protagonists with confirmed ages they dont what would you have me link besides bulbapedia dont answer that btw we could either end this here or continue arguing about fictional ages but i feel ive made my point regarding that misconception half the protagonists official ages are confirmed not and the unoffical ones are just that unofficial yes i know you werent arguing this but its part of my argument and since ive made my point im satisfied i would prefer we not waste time on this debate any more but its up to you
pokemon,not_removed,suddenly the whole world makes sense
pokemon,not_removed,primordial sea and desolate land cancel each other out
pokemon,not_removed,but with primal kyogres primordial sea they cancel each other out and by typing alone water wins against fireground
pokemon,not_removed,i like your flair btw
pokemon,not_removed,awesome i swear im not trying to be a dick about this i just like having verified sources especially on disputed claims and the protagonists ages especially the girls aredebated
pokemon,not_removed,relevant flair too
pokemon,not_removed,wow thats an excellent observation being that it is a weather based pokemon with balllike appendages it might be the most relevant flair possible for the subject
pokemon,not_removed,i like the way you think even if youre being incredibly sarcastic please dont hurt me
pokemon,not_removed,im a simple man i see luxray i give an upvote would give two if it was possible for shiny shiny luxray is my favorite one by far
pokemon,not_removed,is mimikyu really that tiny
pokemon,not_removed,wow
pokemon,not_removed,i love shiny luxray two summers ago i completed the dex and just shiny bred i bred so many shinies including all the pokémon i drew but luxray will always be the best shiny
pokemon,not_removed,pokédex tall
pokemon,not_removed,to be honest i looked at the heights of the pokemon agreed with some and disagreed with others like lucario being so i pretty much drew them how i would want them to be making myself roughly
pokemon,not_removed,time to play the game
pokemon,not_removed,should get dig and water gun upon evolving to final stage then
pokemon,not_removed,funnily enough this is one of the main reasons why i want litten
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,request haich face poorly shopped on to leaked litten evo
pokemon,not_removed,paging dr uitsadndmonsternow
pokemon,not_removed,straight outta nowhere
pokemon,not_removed,sledgehammer arm was super effective
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,umdid anyone else see that the crotch is umomg lmfao
pokemon,not_removed,litten uses bury its super effective litten has gone fucking over
pokemon,not_removed,and i want to see litten leaked evo vs absorption in the
pokemon,not_removed,muhuhuhuhaahaha
pokemon,not_removed,thats grrrrrrrrrreat
pokemon,not_removed,httpimgurcomaevkmt
pokemon,not_removed,ill happily second this summoning uitsadndmonsternow
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,if its hands were actually that proportional id probably like the design a lot more very nice comic
pokemon,not_removed,its all about the game and how you play it
pokemon,not_removed,i can never escape rsquaredcircle
pokemon,not_removed,your username is unbelievably relevant
pokemon,not_removed,all about the rules and if you can take it
pokemon,not_removed,i literally just went from squaredcircle to hereto find haitch face
pokemon,not_removed,is this title supposed to be the same as
pokemon,not_removed,thats one hell of a shit bot
pokemon,not_removed,not me but i have a friend whos doing a wobbuffet only run of y six wobbuffet nothing else except for hm slaves
pokemon,not_removed,not sure if this counts but a friend and i teamed up in the battle maison using mega audino and gigalith for me and slaking and mega gyarados for my friend we got rounds in before a wigglytuff came in and ruined the dream the team was mostly built around removing truant from the equation
pokemon,not_removed,i tried doing an emerald poison only run and then realized that there really wasnt enough poisons early on to effectively do this so i switched to bug ended the elite with ninjask shedinja beautifly and volbeat ive never been so uncomfortable with my ending team
pokemon,not_removed,i had this huge crush on starcraft so i made a team zerg drapion brutalisk yanmega viper gliscor mutalisk parasect swarm host ariados roach anorith drone venipede larva
pokemon,not_removed,my recent playthrough of omega ruby was a wonder trade run with the stipulation that id have to keep trading until i got something with a nickname the result was my favorite team out of any pokemon game ive played and a surprising amount of personality developed as we journeyed together there were kathy tran a pichu who thinks shes a young vietnamese woman or possibly a young vietnamese woman with a tazer who everyone sees as a pichu we never could agree on which one was actually the case though the fact that she could speak english made the latter seem a little more probable the energetic adventurer of the group shes enjoying her time in the pokemon world and trying to see everything she can dragonfly a powerful but capricious trapinch with a love for performing whether on the battlefield or in pokemon contests even though he was originally a selfabsorbed loner hes learned to depend on others and has grown into the big brother of the group he dreams of defeating the elite four and winning a place in the pokemon hall of fame valentine a smoochum the baby of the group she loves playing tricks and playing matchmaker even though nothing ever seems to come of it she doesnt have any reason of her own for winning the pokemon league she just wants to help all her friends achieve their dreams kitkat this is the coldest most calculating skitty ive ever laid eyes on he may act like a playboy in public but hes extraordinarily focused and serious behind closed doors ambitious too hell do anything to get his hands on more authority and the pokemon league is just another way of achieving that goal hes the sarcastic cynical member of the group mcnichalous a stoic patient lucario with something of a complex about his name like dragonfly hes very passionate about battles but this is because mcnichalous views pokemon battles as a tool for selfreflection and discipline he seeks enlightenment through battle and idolizes the elite fours pokemon as the pinnacle of selfimprovement daring dennis a thrillseeking camerupt with a hairtrigger temper and a passion for life hes the sort to go rushing in headlong into danger on a whim then dig in his heels and insist he knew exactly what he was doing after the fact hes young and impulsive and he views the pokemon league championship as the perfect opportunity to test his skills so even though its not necessarily the weirdest in terms of pokemon i consider it the weirdest in terms of personality i ended up taking on the elite four with a pokemon that thinks its a young vietnamese woman or possibly vice versa a battling diva or whatever the male equivalent is called a pranksterslashshipper with an emphasis on the slash to the horror of our four male teammates a chessmaster lothario a pseudomonk in disposition and the pokemon incarnation of leeroy jenkins it was a lot of fun
pokemon,not_removed,in a run of leafgreen my only pokemon were chding the farfetchd you trade for and bulbasaur unevolved chding swept the by himself also in the begining of xys wifi battle scene i used to run a male meowstic ditto and mega aerodactyl and it was surprisingly effective
pokemon,not_removed,back when i started playing pokemon crystal version i accidently released all of my pokemon including my starter because i thought releasing would let them walk with me just like in the anime i was like years old that time the only pokemon who survived that massacre was a krabby after crying for like an hour i decided to continue my journey with that krabby and a pikachu i caught and the rest is history so basically my weirdest team ive ever used was a lvl kingler with full hm attack moves and a lvl pikachu because i didnt know how to evolve it
pokemon,not_removed,not sure if this is weird but its my favourite team in emerald sceptile salamence aggron walrein lanturn and glalie
pokemon,not_removed,dustox scolipede crobat tentacruel dragalge toxicroak or dustox scolipede escavalier yanmega shedinja volcarona i always trade out my starter for one of my many cascoons cause dustox is everything to me then i either go full bug type or full poison type
pokemon,not_removed,went through emerald using only grass types a couple times sceptile ludicolo tropius cacturne cradily and breloom were my hof team
pokemon,not_removed,my current team and its intentional elesa luxray because if ive missed a trainer or something i want them to not exist anymore falkner staraptor because transport and its capable of killing ground thank god arcane kadabra to whittle down the hp of the legendaries im using this squad to catch billyray electabuzz the inevitable pureelectric thats female five attempts five females thunder wave maker plus not bad in a pinch agent absol feint attack because well ive already dropped on dusk balls swagsire quagsire yawn plus hm slave butler would absolutely hate to battle with them properly but they serve
pokemon,not_removed,i played platinum with a wierd team torterra staraptor gastrodon bastiodon yes really and bibarel my team has no dark ghost or psychic coverage
pokemon,not_removed,trick room team with eviolite dusclops mega camerupt regigigas scizor mienshao and exeggutor
pokemon,not_removed,delphox charizard typhlosion blaziken scizor and gogoat
pokemon,not_removed,back in the day of crystal i went the whole game with only my typhlosion i had a bunch of rattata and pidgeys for when he fainted and a ton of revives easily the hardest thing ive done current team for y play through frodgadier fletchander sylveon skiddo elektrike and noibat not too weird
pokemon,not_removed,when i played through pokemon white or black i cant remember my team was emboar hydriegon stunfisk jellicent swoobat and ferrothorn my reasoning was because i wanted a completely dualtyped with no type overlapping each other im still unsure why i put myself through that
pokemon,not_removed,probably my most recent y run roserade bellossom vespiquen shiny minun shiny plusle and the out of place tyranitar
pokemon,not_removed,my strangest team was a playthrough of y in the fact i used primarily oddball stuff which included vivillion flareon mega ampharos a thick club marowak alongside my starters vivillion turned out to be a beast d thanks to compound eyes giving a near perfect sleep powder quiver dance accurate hurricanes my planned sunmoon team is currently somewhat shaping up to be dark souls themed when a friend pointed it out as i have jangmoo artorias considering both are brave and determined lycanroc sif snorlax smough planned so far and could add alolan raichu orstein
pokemon,not_removed,as i write this i am going through x with lampent aegislash gourgeist gengar drifblim and golurk i made my character blond and named him morty yes i am rewriting the story of the jhoto ghost gym leader haahahahaha cant wait for alola phoebee will be so cool
pokemon,not_removed,i used three unowns an l unown an o unown and another l unown i challenged random people on the pss it was april
pokemon,not_removed,my oras team sceptile glalie gallade linoone mightyena replaced by latios altaria
pokemon,not_removed,my current run of omega ruby raichu quilava not evolving him carbink cacturne noctowl and butterfree lol worked out well beat steven
pokemon,not_removed,im currently working on a shiny only run of oras ive got fearow porygon muk aegislash swampert and ninetales prettiest damn team and porygon is the surprise favorite porygon used to be my most disliked pokemon im also doing a nuzlocke of pokemon yellow ive got pikachu dodrio poliwrath dragonite arcanine and scyther pikachu and dragonite are the only two ive used before im surprised how attached i am to poliwrath and dodrio i have lostkilled a lot of my pokemon though i had some serious favorites that id hoped would make it to the like sandslash and clefable cest la vie
pokemon,not_removed,probably my black and white team that i cant remember exactly what i had but i remember it being funky hang on while i try to find my save file
pokemon,not_removed,in my oras nuzlocke i used linoones alteria hariyama dodrio and a walrein
pokemon,not_removed,youre clearly gonna do good since you have the all mighty beedrill too bad he wont compare to bundt
pokemon,not_removed,the wide array of available pokémon is one of my favorite features of x and y ive played y about times through now and each time im able to make a very different and unique team weirdest one ive had is huntail charizard vileplume jolteon doublade and talonflame i think or some other bird
pokemon,not_removed,hgss teamgyarados i got an adamant one and ev trained it early on and after dragon dances it could take out anything it was so underlevelled when i got to red i needed to catch a donphan to take out the pikachu xd
pokemon,not_removed,masquerain stunfisk ferrothorn exploud croagunk stoutland
pokemon,not_removed,played once soul silver with only small cute pokemon my final team was something like eevee chikorita dunsparce wooper vulpix swinub holy shit dunsparce put in work that run its actually pretty good pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,if and when gsc comes out on virtual console im going see how far i can get with just two sentretsfurrets
pokemon,not_removed,soulsilver run with sunflora stantler qwilfish crobat typhlosion and sudowoodo typhlosion and crobat are pretty standard but the other four are pretty out there
pokemon,not_removed,just beat the elite in diamond used my starter plus the first pokemon i encountered so ended up with a team consisting of torterra bibarel staraptor crobat luxray and kricketune
pokemon,not_removed,ninjask baton pass to mega aggron it was weird af since it was stalling mostly then megaing and destroying life but really op
pokemon,not_removed,i pledged that when i finally got to six shinies in firered i would use them to take on the elite four my team consisted of raticate pidgeot pidgeotto tauros arbok and magneton
pokemon,not_removed,im doing platinum rn and i went with accidentally pokemon that need trade evos so im at the with graveler haunter and kadabra and then a medicham noctowl and tentacruel ive never finished a game without a third stage evolution in my team also fully evolved i have are just straight up not good i just lost my first time through because ive realized i have nothing to use against lucian
pokemon,not_removed,i always try to switch up my teams on each play of the games i also try to use generation specific pokemon as best i can my current black team is emboar musharna seismitoad maractus cofagrigus and beartic
pokemon,not_removed,my x team was a little unbalanced to say the least greninja blaziken charizard sylveon lucario hydreigon
pokemon,not_removed,infernape starmie garchomp staraptor delphox and greninja
pokemon,not_removed,right now replaying heartgold and lost my pokewalker while my cyndaquil was on it so ive had to have a slightly altered party to usual with a magmar electabuzz gyarados growlithe podgeotto and tentacruel currently up to the gym
pokemon,not_removed,my bf and i brought a mono ghost team to a multi battle tournament in my town last year we won every single first match best of three with the element of surprise and a lot of people hated my froslass that night my side of the team consisted of froslassmvp gengar trevenant jellicent sableye and coffagrigus
pokemon,not_removed,arin is that you
pokemon,not_removed,i once did a pikachujigglypuff run i named them after really good super smash brothers players and only used restpoundrolloutsing for jigglypuff and quick attackthunderetc to be just like the smash characters lol
pokemon,not_removed,right now in platinum ive got magnezone espeon sneasel gliscor tangrowth heracross
pokemon,not_removed,alolan exeggutor alolan raticate wait were talking about teams weve already used
pokemon,not_removed,in omega ruby muk masquerain sceptile minun whiscash and kadabra no friends i know stop saying masquerain is better than i never think water ice flying bug moves and he learn quiver dance op move
pokemon,not_removed,id ask why but we all know hed respond wynaut
pokemon,not_removed,the most important question with or without lipstick
pokemon,not_removed,thats the most beautiful thing i have ever heard
pokemon,not_removed,how did you remove truant
pokemon,not_removed,i beat the entirety of doubles in the battle maison with delibird primeape eelektross and mkanga id use frost breath always crits on primepae then just try and sweep with earthquake or rock slide or something it worked sometimes
pokemon,not_removed,shoulda thrown a dustox and an illumise in there maybe even masquerain why only four pokémon
pokemon,not_removed,lvl and moveset of chding
pokemon,not_removed,visionary
pokemon,not_removed,hm butler hrm
pokemon,not_removed,ok ill hang on thanks
pokemon,not_removed,sounds like simple beam
pokemon,not_removed,audino skill swap then mega evolves next turn pretty simple work
pokemon,not_removed,i tried that once with a hacked team just for giggles ramparados massive attack stat with the anger point boost literally destroys everything as long as it outspeeds that is t
pokemon,not_removed,pretty sure you can get pinsir too and possibly heracross
pokemon,not_removed,i was doing a semi nuzlocke run since theres such a small quantity of bug types i allowed it past the first encounter but only one of each evo line and i had a dustox named regret i wanted my beautifly first that got kod by flannery because i miscalculated damage and illumise got knocked out while i was training it low health got pursuited on the same route i caught it according to my research surskit isnt available at all in emerald for some odd and annoying reason
pokemon,not_removed,swalot and dustox and tentacruel are the only ones i can think of off the top of my head i loved swalot back in the day
pokemon,not_removed,im thinking it finished the somewhere in the mid moveset was cut slash fly and swords dance holding a stick no where near competitive but chding was fun to use
pokemon,not_removed,i actually found it had to plug in my ds lol i had samurrott volcarona simisear boldore never managed to evolve him and i transfered over my luxray and arcanine in retrospect it was basically a glass cannon team with a samurrott and boldore i never actually went hunting for better pokemon so i just settled for the ones i likedbonded with pulled a full ash ketchum there probably why i could never beat the elite four
pokemon,not_removed,imagine slaking with curse and a partner with simple beam shudders
pokemon,not_removed,i thought simple beam didnt work on truant
pokemon,not_removed,oh thats sneaky
pokemon,not_removed,flannery aka ms lets one hit ko everything because if i do youre fucked i i miss or dont ko im fucked i feel your pain mate
pokemon,not_removed,lets not forget the god tier seviper i remember my first time play rse i got decimated by a seviper not expecting it to be god tier
pokemon,not_removed,if youre not worried about sacrificing a pokémon trying it with protean kecleon might be interesting
pokemon,not_removed,in english it would be mega yanmega
pokemon,not_removed,would haiku again
pokemon,not_removed,an interesting name has six syllables bad haiku would not recite
pokemon,not_removed,are you team rocket agent
pokemon,not_removed,a good chunk of people did
pokemon,not_removed,awesome i used a dunsparce in a noevolution run of black and it was surprisingly a star member of my team even though i had only planned on using it temporarily ive got a ton of respect for the little well as little as salamence guy and even more now that ive seen your feat
pokemon,not_removed,now how many full restores did you use
pokemon,not_removed,your clothes even match i love how realistic it would be in the pokemon world as many people have strong pokemon as their partner
pokemon,not_removed,really proud of ree but lets not kid ourselves an evolution would be pretty bomb
pokemon,not_removed,reminds me i need to do my mudkip run good work i love hearing of these kinds of runs its just so nice to hear the legends of these wimpy pokemon who go on to single handedly conquer the league
pokemon,not_removed,thanks that means a lot
pokemon,not_removed,i dont remember but it was plenty
pokemon,not_removed,the incredible adventure of mantyke the dumbass
pokemon,not_removed,now go through kanto raise that little shit to and sweep reds team
pokemon,not_removed,jesus christ for being a baby mantyke is a beast in special defense
pokemon,not_removed,yo that adamant nature tho
pokemon,not_removed,oh lordy that was good maybe go with a single stager or happiness mon with an everstone
pokemon,not_removed,thanks red forman
pokemon,not_removed,how did you get through the parts without whirlpool and cut and stuff
pokemon,not_removed,so basically a focus sash is required for red because you are not outspeeding that level volt tackle pikachu
pokemon,not_removed,your mantyke is adamant s
pokemon,not_removed,mantyke is such a happy pokemon i just have to love it
pokemon,not_removed,this i like this
pokemon,not_removed,love these thanks for sharing
pokemon,not_removed,so how does one go about emulating a ds and changing a starter like you did mind giving me a quick rundown
pokemon,not_removed,pokémon red foreman version
pokemon,not_removed,usually i try not to hack my pokemon pic you have more than just one poke o
pokemon,not_removed,so how exactly is this possible just a lot of revives and potions nothing in your final build made the mantyke seem extraordinary surf and wing attack really
pokemon,not_removed,can i have some links to previous runs
pokemon,not_removed,theres a fisherman named tully heh
pokemon,not_removed,well done to you for completing the game with mantyke and making me start heartgold again
pokemon,not_removed,i love you
pokemon,not_removed,this should be in the rage thread
pokemon,not_removed,this was incredibly entertaining d cant wait for more are there other playthroughs i need more mantyke action
pokemon,not_removed,mantykemantine is my favorite pokemon that mantyke abuse was hilarious though
pokemon,not_removed,if i were creative with my titles this would be it
pokemon,not_removed,thats what part will be level not required
pokemon,not_removed,it really helped as one of lances dragonites knows thunder
pokemon,not_removed,right it was occasionally useful though
pokemon,not_removed,hey thanks my options have nearly doubled now that and gen mons have become available to me so youll likely see a few of those in the future
pokemon,not_removed,probably an hm slave same way people do sunkernonly runs
pokemon,not_removed,well see what happens when i get there
pokemon,not_removed,yep
pokemon,not_removed,of course and thanks
pokemon,not_removed,sure i use desmume as the emulator and i use the universal pokemon randomizer to edit the starters
pokemon,not_removed,usually you need to use hms
pokemon,not_removed,hah revives if my pokemon faints its soft reset and no nothing particularly amazing here just what you see
pokemon,not_removed,theyre httpsechoingsongimgurcom
pokemon,not_removed,d
pokemon,not_removed,alright lets see what i did is possible on a cartridge but much easier on an emulator if youre on cartridge trade your starter for an egg of the pokemon of your choosing as soon as youre able to trade you will need to catch one other pokemon so that the game allows you to trade for an egg if youre on emulator edit the game using the universal pokemon randomizer so that one of the starters is the pokemon you want youre going to need to use other pokemon for hms but youre obviously not battling with them the only exception is if you get caught in a double or triple battle where its unavoidable i am playing soul silver which is a remake of silver red is the final boss of sorts in this game and the original goldsilver he appears after you get all badges and travel to the most remote area of the game i hope that answered everything
pokemon,not_removed,no more mantyke for now httpsechoingsongimgurcom
pokemon,not_removed,abuse my mantyke is just a dumbass is all lovable little dumbass
pokemon,not_removed,glad i could help d
pokemon,not_removed,if you go through all of kanto with just him itl almost certainly hit or at least be in the mid
pokemon,not_removed,literally any run since you dont want to load up with bad hm moves
pokemon,not_removed,cool thanks from what i can tell i just need to download a rom to play it with the emulator if i want to edit the starters and stuff should i make a copy of the rom to edit so i can keep the original
pokemon,not_removed,oh didnt think about that p
pokemon,not_removed,well hats off to you my friend well done
pokemon,not_removed,given that ive never leveled anything past and even then only level once usually im in the low or lower in a gen run i can safely say that i wont max my level in this run
pokemon,not_removed,youd be surprised how much exp you actually need when coming close to ive done two solo runs of the gen iv remakes and i think they only got up to the high at red
pokemon,not_removed,pretty much but then hms have barely been required for main game since gen
pokemon,not_removed,you can do rse with just a mudkip and castform in the dex requires a solid amount of time with a bunch of hms on mudkip
pokemon,not_removed,thats what i do
pokemon,not_removed,ive done one in every game except and dp but platinum is basically the same its all pretty much the same thing so just pick your favorite game knowing it better will make it more fun if you need challenge the pokemon is the biggest determiner of challenge for me the most challenging was ditto but maybe dont try that ever
pokemon,not_removed,that pikachu red has could give you problems especially as a waterflying i know i never beat it back in the day
pokemon,not_removed,mantyke cant outspeed reds pikachu without pulling some shenanigans so you might have to just to try and power through thunder maybe need one of those items that lowers damage from se attacks also the remakes are the easiest postgame for grinding imo you can rematch all the gym leaders with their level teams as well as the league with their higher level teams you dont have to defeat the whole league but you could fight the first couple a few times then just lose on purpose
pokemon,not_removed,depends on how much you battle i guess when i did a murkrow solo run of hg i fought literally every trainer i could and was something like level before even fighting hooh did a rattata run and was level before id even defeated all the gyms
pokemon,not_removed,every run has some form of new challenge for me ill solve that problem like all the others ive had
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i see some people saying its impossible to outspeed reds pikachu and providing some competitivelike analysis but quick claw exists and mantyke knows confuse ray
pokemon,not_removed,huh i must have missed a lot of trainers indeed because you generally need the same amount of exp to go from to in order to go from to no wonder i see people complaining about too much exp in hgss maybe i was just too excited to finally get rayquaza p
pokemon,not_removed,if you plan on doing ditto anyway i hope your favorite move is struggle shedinja was also a pain but not nearly as bad
pokemon,not_removed,yeah im sure you can figure it out haha if you can beat the base game with just mantyke you can probably do anything with mantyke did you randomly choose mantyke i cant imagine how mad i would be if i was choosing randomly and ended up with togepi or another pokemon i hate
pokemon,not_removed,well i can provide some numbers at least so you have an idea for what to expect reds pikachu will have a speed of mantyke literally cannot surpass that without a choice scarf or a scenario you dont have it requires a speed nature i really doubt that you have ivs in both special defense and hp and probably the patience needed to get ev reducing berries as well because even at level spa light ball pikachu thunderbolt vs hp spd mantyke chance to ohko thats a level mantyke with ivs in the relevant stats vs reds pikachu you probably dont have that so brute forcing this probably wont work youll figure out a solution though im sure
pokemon,not_removed,thats gonna be a lot of luck for quick claw probably gonna get one shot a few times and do you not plan to oneshot pikachu because unless you have sold your soul to rng satan the chances of pikachu missing not once but two or even three times in a row after also getting off a quick claw confuse ray are very slim
pokemon,not_removed,only too much exp if youre soloing johto is still the worst region ever for grinding imo its kanto postgame where its good
pokemon,not_removed,what if hypothetically you had say max elixers just out of curiosity
pokemon,not_removed,yeah pretty much at random
pokemon,not_removed,i think i already have quick claw confuse ray its a low activation chance and then only a success rate but i think thats what ill end up doing lots of soft resetting in my future
pokemon,not_removed,yep most likely
pokemon,not_removed,well if you pick a different game nothing spoiled
pokemon,not_removed,wouldnt be too bad then youd still have shit for stats no matter how hard you grinded but you wouldnt have to struggle
pokemon,not_removed,next you should use an igglybuff
pokemon,not_removed,do you take suggestions for your runs
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,i used to but i usually take such a long time between runs nowadays that i forget them all by the time i start a new run
pokemon,not_removed,this makes me happy d
pokemon,not_removed,actually shuckle can deal the most damage over the ohko a level shuckle can potentially deal the most damage in one single attack through the use of numerous stat boosters by using helping hand by two different pokémon in a triple battle holding a metronome power trick a skill swap to pure power or huge power attack boosts and a mimiced me first used on a slower pokémon using the defense curlrollout combo also shuckles partner must have the ability flower gift and the weather must be sunny on the turn of using rollout consecutively without any misses if used against a level ledyba yanma or combee with minimum defense stats that have been hit with negative defense modifiers such as screech it can deal damage with a critical hit bulbapedia
pokemon,not_removed,yeah a shuckle with vcreate and sniper power swapped obviously
pokemon,not_removed,attack power swap defense curl huge power crit final turn of rollout choice band shuckle vs lvl defense ivev ledyba that should be higher
pokemon,not_removed,ice ball rollout change type to ice with skill swapped protean before changing to huge power abra can become dragonflyinggrass by using reflect type from gen with mimic on a noibat with forests curse in theory this should do double that because of the added ice weakness
pokemon,not_removed,im curious as to whether a shuckle thats had its type changed to fire by some means im sure there are ways just cant think of any right now could get a higher damage yield by using me first on a vcreate against whatever the lowestdefense nongrass pokemon whos weak to fire is if the target was under the influence of forests curse had been skill swapped dry skin and was under strong sunlight with all the other boosting factors from the rollout combo in place
pokemon,not_removed,ooo didnt think of abra nice one but chanseyhappiny has lower base def
pokemon,not_removed,are we talking single move damage or cumulated multiple attack damage beacuse the rollouts setup wont hae any effect on vcreate also im not sure theres any legal way to get fire type on shuckle
pokemon,not_removed,× weak to fire use forests curse on an alolan sandshrew for an × hit
pokemon,not_removed,i know the rollout setup wont affect a vcreate i was just talking about comparing vcreate directly to rollout with all the other circumstances double helping hand attack et al intact except now ive looked up the exact mechanics of how rollout damage is calculated and yeah never mind theres no way vcreates catching up with that any time soon i didnt realize it actually doubled in power with each consecutive hit also just for the record mimicking reflect type or conversion could make shuckle a firetype although thatd stop it from mimicking me first so its not applicable here
pokemon,not_removed,turns out that vcreate on an effective hit effective bp still falls far short of effective defensecurlboosted rollout effective bp if my arithmetic is right
pokemon,not_removed,yeah rollouts base power doubled by defense curl is exceedingly ridiculous
pokemon,not_removed,charmander cyndiquil mudkip piplup snivy froakie rowlet easily the fan favorites and i align with none of them except snivy and rowlet
pokemon,not_removed,i love me some turtwig line a starter that stabs with earthquake yes please
pokemon,not_removed,youre right except piplup i think pretty sure it was almost a dead lock with turtwig barely on top
pokemon,not_removed,i see people posting about piplup a lot more especially in art gen was the worst for starters imo i never used any hated the designs so i dont care about that gens starters anyways bulbasaur totodile treecko snivy and soon to be rowlet for my favorites grass type master race
pokemon,not_removed,i love your flair rip
pokemon,not_removed,gen four had the strongest lineup there was no clear best starter and each one was still really good and had a cool design gen had by far the weakest
pokemon,not_removed,was there a nuzlocke where someone named their breloom that thats what u always call mine and im sorta confused
pokemon,not_removed,imo in case you missed that part the starters are all subjective i hated gen but that doesnt mean they are objectively bad everyones opinions differ you thinking they are the best lineup and was the worst is an opinion nothing more
pokemon,not_removed,oh no i figured that your flair was a reference to marrilands pokemon in his nuzlocke
pokemon,not_removed,ah no ill watch it now since foxglove is basically my favorite
pokemon,not_removed,well it is hawaii and they said its not native
pokemon,not_removed,sableye reminds me more of stitch or at least looks like it could be his cousin
pokemon,not_removed,we need a pokemon stitch hack with all the experiments
pokemon,not_removed,another one of jumbas experiments
pokemon,not_removed,looks more like reuben
pokemon,not_removed,i hope to god its shiny is the colors of stitch
pokemon,not_removed,as an avid lover of lilo and stitch this pleases me a great deal
pokemon,not_removed,i dunno sableye is the pokemon i always associated with stitch
pokemon,not_removed,great now i have to name it stitch please tell me httpiimgurcomvxhdxufjpg is its shiny version
pokemon,not_removed,lille and yungoose a didney movie
pokemon,not_removed,stealing that nickname if i decide to recruit a yungoos
pokemon,not_removed,if i dont get a lilo and stitch reference in this game ill cry
pokemon,not_removed,great youve made me like yungoos
pokemon,not_removed,if we dont get a character named lilo i will be very disappointed
pokemon,not_removed,aaaaaaaaaaw i just wanna cuddle it
pokemon,not_removed,getting this beastie just to name him stitch give me a bluen shiny and im done eh ih hi
pokemon,not_removed,i love it
pokemon,not_removed,may actually use him just for thishope his evolution is cool
pokemon,not_removed,i need it
pokemon,not_removed,so much yes that is awesome
pokemon,not_removed,fucking love this
pokemon,not_removed,ohana means family
pokemon,not_removed,i love this
pokemon,not_removed,i want one in shiny blue
pokemon,not_removed,i wasnt very fond of yungoos until i saw this image
pokemon,not_removed,jumba shame on you
pokemon,not_removed,this show and the movies meant everything to me
pokemon,not_removed,i completely forgot about him why where the bad guys trying to catch him and his freands again also how many where there my estamite is around
pokemon,not_removed,i mean it was inevitable since lets face it this is the closest we will ever get to a pokemonlilo and stitch crossover since we are going to hawaii after all xd
pokemon,not_removed,one might go far as to say its an alien species ill see myself out
pokemon,not_removed,you mean experiment aka reuben
pokemon,not_removed,they did start calling all of the other experiments cousins so maybe sableye is stitchs cousin
pokemon,not_removed,ive always named my sableye lol
pokemon,not_removed,nekkoala a bit as well
pokemon,not_removed,i never knew i needed this til just now
pokemon,not_removed,catch all experiments
pokemon,not_removed,how is this not a thing already
pokemon,not_removed,get on it game freak stitch n cousins expansion pack for sun moon
pokemon,not_removed,there will be a small pokemon in a corner who only makes sandwiches
pokemon,not_removed,play as a girl trainer named lilo and main a yungoos named stitch problem solved
pokemon,not_removed,the bad guy wanted to catch stitch and his cousins in order to take over the galaxy but obviously his henchman gantu the big giant with a fishsharklike head is to incompetent to even try sometime xd and lilo and stitch always tend to outsmart him also there are approximately experiment stitch supposedly being the last one but jumba stitch and his cousinss creator decided to make two more experiments so now there are experiments or is you include leroy from the last movie
pokemon,not_removed,hands shades yeahhhhhhhhh
pokemon,not_removed,it learns sand witch a ground move
pokemon,not_removed,i love you
pokemon,not_removed,no sableye is too skinny to look like reuben
pokemon,not_removed,yep thats what i meant
pokemon,not_removed,nah thats experiment sample
pokemon,not_removed,and he works for waillord i need this gamefreak make it happen
pokemon,not_removed,jumbas reaction to being told he made a always makes me chuckle why not call him uh you already made a with a dazed face i did
pokemon,not_removed,you can also say there is technically a cousin if you count httpdisneywikiacomwikidarkend
pokemon,not_removed,and he works for waillord wailord dude garchomp is a land shark gantu is a land shark
pokemon,not_removed,sheesh i totally forgot about the anime i remember dropping it since the mc wasnt as fun as lilo i just didnt like how so many charachters were gone
pokemon,not_removed,good point the new rabbit like pokemon is garchomps boss and has a cape
pokemon,not_removed,im just now learning that there was an anime weird it doesnt sound like you liked it but is it worth checking out looking through the wiki it looks like there are a few of the same characters but is it a totally different version have stitch and lilo ever even met in this one i have so many questions
pokemon,not_removed,lilo appeared once and yeahi wasnt a fan of it i just didnt like how it was a sequel that left behind so many characters like if itd follow lilos daughter id probably mind it a lot less
pokemon,not_removed,i love how you had this lengthy prologue about this discussion being bound exclusively to the needs of balancing the chart and then immediately indulge your logic and whimsy and even admit things like poison doesnt need this but
pokemon,not_removed,i agree with making ice resistant to water i even do this with roms however the rest of the types seem unnecessary making ice more resistant will make it a lot more powerful instead it should just be given a little small buff electric on steel makes sense but not all metals are good conductors i personally see steel being fine the way it is i like grass resisting rock in reality grass roots are strong enough to break stones so theres that lore behind it i think flying should stay the way it is birds use trees to grow their nests and many of them eat berries too poison on water has been told by many people before and it does make some sense thing is if you pollute water does anything happen to it the answer is no polluting water causes the living organisms in it to die i think bug is fine rock should just resist electric and in turn electric should resist fairy i know the logic is weak but i think that would balance it better than nerfing bug and leave dragon as it is
pokemon,not_removed,id have to disagree im happy with the types the way they are i dont want to relearn all my type matchups thank you very much
pokemon,not_removed,he does have some very good points about what needs to be balanced though we can only hope that gamefreak noticed these issues and fixed then in sun and moon
pokemon,not_removed,again i posted the ones i saw the most not my exclusive personal opinion plus the point was poison doesnt need this but makes it have a more offensive meaning its quite clear if you read the whole argument
pokemon,not_removed,hum i see thank you so much for the feedback regarding to ice i would like to make it have at least resistances to balance the weaknesses or discard a weakness and have resistances either one works well as you said poison kills the organisms in the water even if you meant micro ones but fish would die in poisoned water but well if we come to it poison kills everything but ghost cause theyre already dead good to know we agree on most points
pokemon,not_removed,i agree that gym leaders should be hard not because they should force you to catch mons to win because my opinion is that you use mons you like and not mons that are strong but because it would be actually fun i wouldnt just mash a until theyre dead type chart was never a problem to me i know it all by heart because ive played pokémon since pokémon redblue so changing for me would just be an addition and not annoying at all
pokemon,not_removed,well i know the type chart by heart so changing a few things wouldnt change much in my head
pokemon,not_removed,i love all the route themes from sinnoh and especially they conveyed the sense of adventure so well kalos had a fantastic soundtrack as well im listening to geosenge town now as light background music as a matter of fact
pokemon,not_removed,guns from dpp
pokemon,not_removed,i loved the rise of darkrai movie soundtrack
pokemon,not_removed,im gonna say my top three hooh theme colress theme zinnia theme
pokemon,not_removed,i absolutely love the battle themes from generation theyre so upbeat and truly give a sense of the seriousness and excitement of pokémon battles especially the httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfuqgeizjwy and httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbrkeghwobvs themes are fantastic and lately ive fallen in love with the new from sun moon i just cannot stop listening to it
pokemon,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment httpsyoutubecomwatchvfuqgeizjwy httpsyoutubecomwatchvbrkeghwobvs i absolutely love the battle themes from generation theyre so upbeat and truly give a sense of the seriousness and excitement of pokémon battles especially the subway trainer and champion iris themes are fantastic and lately ive fallen try listening to the ordinary trainer battle theme and decide for yourself of course both of these are fanmade based on the ones we could hear during the livestream however they were made with the intent to make them as close to the origin im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
pokemon,not_removed,always have loved the platinum frontier brain theme
pokemon,not_removed,gen bike theme
pokemon,not_removed,zinnias theme giratinas theme darkrais theme from dp you know when you could actually battle him
pokemon,not_removed,generations and were probably the all around best especially with the music generation music feels like what i would hear in the anime and thats not a bad thing
pokemon,not_removed,me too route is awesome as well
pokemon,not_removed,i do like all of those i just hope sumo isnt as bouncy as that song leads me to believe
pokemon,not_removed,the red one is just the main theme remixed right
pokemon,not_removed,try listening to the ordinary theme and decide for yourself of course both of these are fanmade based on the ones we could hear during the livestream however they were made with the intent to make them as close to the original as possible so it is very likely something akin to this that well end up getting
pokemon,not_removed,im just afraid that sun and moon will end up too similar to xyoras while i liked those games they didnt have the charm of the ds games
pokemon,not_removed,that solo about seconds in was pretty awesome i got listen to that part specifically over and over again fan of the music so far
pokemon,not_removed,musicwise i dont really feel the xyorasness in these two themes at all to be completely honest so im not afraid of that in the slightest
pokemon,not_removed,my first impression was i love it my impression now is i love it sunmoon is the most fun ive had watching the pokemon anime since the original season my only problem is that it doesnt do much with the sunmoon story which i guess has always been a problem with the anime its already pretty good in my eyes but it could probably be even better
pokemon,not_removed,i liked a lot of the earlier episodes more because they provide crucial info on pokemon that we dont really know much about recent episodes seem to stray from this a bit the highlight for me was the episode with alolan persian stoutland and litten it really gave us a great story to characterize these pokemon but i care less about the human characters and recent episodes seem to have emphasized them more
pokemon,not_removed,is pretty fresh like the animation specially after getting use to the new design of ash jessie and james and like the side characters also im really curious how they do the ultra beast stuff
pokemon,not_removed,the animation is amazing and disney xd needs to hurry the fuck up with the dub
pokemon,not_removed,you have nothing to contribute to start the discussion
pokemon,not_removed,hmm it went from im laughing because the xy fans got annoying with how the series was at its peak with xyz to this is actually pretty good since its doing its own thing to okay theres this and that but its not really going anywhere is it i do apologize if my first opinion was more or less formed to spite fans who enjoyed what was going on at the time and upset that what made them happy was shifting to another point but its weird many thought xy was the series highest points but i looked at it and i couldnt see what they meant it looked like diamond and pearl to me and i wasnt a fan of how dp worked out so i appreciated the slower change of pace and the more youthful approach to the series at first granted i still like the animated artstyle and i appreciate the advancements in animation because i felt xy didnt have that impact or fluidity but i dont know the story just seems to drop a bit theres pieces here and there that make sunmoon stand out and seem better than the previous seasons but im not really sure what about sunmoon im really having an issue with
pokemon,not_removed,in fairness sun and moon the game was pretty slow to start with so they decided to justuse that i guess they gotta make it last years
pokemon,not_removed,i mean theres trainers so far and the final group if there is one hasnt been finalized they kind of need to develop them
pokemon,not_removed,not really beyond the usual i was wrong the style really works well and matches sugimoris style nowadays and its a lot less static
pokemon,not_removed,the thing with xy is they got a lot more right than wrong they gave ash a better team mind you it was like weak to electric and three of his members were flying they made him stronger and essentially gave him the gurl however you are right in that it wasnt that good for one ash despite gaining competence was basically justthe hero aside from one arc nothing about him changed they still spent a bunch of time on filler and the league and overall ending was wasted
pokemon,not_removed,thats true but in this series the pokemon are the stars of the show interesting character drama can be found a million other places
pokemon,not_removed,they better not leave lady acerola out of the group or else
pokemon,not_removed,shes on island
pokemon,not_removed,ikr but ash has technically been on island already so
pokemon,not_removed,i love the fact that i can spend a dollar on an audio file that is seconds long
pokemon,not_removed,this game has one of my favourite soundtrack next to black and white i would buy this if it wasnt i tunes
pokemon,not_removed,disappointing that its only on itunes and not other distribution services
pokemon,not_removed,any bonus tracks
pokemon,not_removed,i like the name of lusamines second fight showdown lusamine
pokemon,not_removed,will it be released on any other platforms
pokemon,not_removed,now that i know the name of the song that plays when youre talking with lillie during the climax of the story i can find sheet music of it
pokemon,not_removed,happy birthday to me
pokemon,not_removed,i browsed the tracks in itunes i cant find this music from the trailer httpsmyoutubecomwatchvnizppiitrgs
pokemon,not_removed,its worth it
pokemon,not_removed,so two things not to start a gen war but interesting that bw has your favorite soundtrack i mean its not bad by any means but personally id rate them in my own experience vii ii vi i v iii havent played iv edit guys me putting v that low doesnt mean that i didnt like it in fact im actually quite surprised its that low in ranking since i really did enjoy it a lot i guess i just enjoyed those others significantly more why hesitant about itunes they got rid of the drm and their music files are still some of the best quality for compressed around plus ten bucks
pokemon,not_removed,yeah im just glad they even do soundtrack releases at all
pokemon,not_removed,probably not for digital generally the super music collections tend to be constrained to itunes
pokemon,not_removed,think of it this way you can get of music for dollars
pokemon,not_removed,unwavering emotions route village bridge pokemon world tournament final elite four the battle themes for n ghetsis hugh colress all the gym themes from personalizing them to the gym leaders was something they shouldve kept up for kalos gen was definitely the worst though fuck your meme trumpets
pokemon,not_removed,lol my favourite soundtracks is almost opposite of yours viiv vi iii ii i havent played gen it would be easier for me if it also released in google play because i already have money in there
pokemon,not_removed,i just use pokeli for youtube for most of it its free and hes much faster
pokemon,not_removed,well shit guess ill just have to order a cd
pokemon,not_removed,route and pwt final are absolutely dope the rest are really awesome but not better than vis or viis mirroring music iis and is are also so iconic theyve influenced and carried over into countless pieces of the later games soundtracks just my opinion on the matter though one of the things i liked a lot about unova despite not being a very good region was its atmosphere and the music played a lot into that
pokemon,not_removed,unova champion is so underrated imo it wasnt a strong or intense theme but it fit the end of the game so well and had a good catchy rhythm it was fun and not anxiety inducing
pokemon,not_removed,its less opposite than youd think actually and lots of it can be explained we wont agree on v but ii and i i have immense respect for since their themes have been often carried over and inspired many of the future soundtracks plus red and lances theme from ii is tops but iii is near the bottom for both of us your reasoning for google play makes sense that being said it unfortunately probably wont be going there
pokemon,not_removed,iv i hear has pretty strong music but not the series best for the most part besides it doesnt invalidate the rest of my rankingits also not as relevant to this conversation
pokemon,not_removed,but you have to use data and you cant play it while multitasking
pokemon,not_removed,hey i love all the gens music no complaints here i like talking about it totally agree on and iconic themes despite the lack of instruments to work with whereas gen and benefit heavily from the sound capabilities and it makes for great stuff you should play platinum its got some grinding issues which makes any games pregen hard to go back to imho but its a solid game with great music
pokemon,not_removed,plenty climactic though and it fit a magical girl champion
pokemon,not_removed,its not gen fault for being at the bottom its just because the music is outdated and not as advanced as thenones we have these days but gen has more of gems than all around good soundtrack imo the gems would be lances theme which is so damn epic especially the intro works better with red though also the kanto wild battle theme and the gym leader themes
pokemon,not_removed,i probably should get to platinum eventuallymany consider gen iv the overall worst but i might as well anyway as it is from an overall standpoint my favorite generations are probably ii vii v i vi iii the only ones with solid positioning in there however are ii and vii everything else just shifts around though i generally consider iii to be my least favorite and ii my favorite just a few weeks ago it was more like ii vi i v iii
pokemon,not_removed,ecruteak city theme is the best one from gen imo
pokemon,not_removed,but thats why its nice that the hgss remakes came around because it remastered those themes and gave even more life to them plus i think even as there were so many super endearing themes in gens i and ii
pokemon,not_removed,im not paying for youtube red
pokemon,not_removed,dont listen to the people calling the worst gen it was rock solid dp was a rough start but platinum took out all the kinks and hgss was amazing sinnoh is also prob my favourite region because of how huge and diverse it is
pokemon,not_removed,ecruteck is the most unique theme in the game imo and i also consider it a gem i just named the few of the top of my mind i also want to add that the cave and ice cave themes are really good
pokemon,not_removed,ya i love those gems because of soul silver gen being so low on my list doesnt mean i think its the worst i think of it more as my favourite plus there are some really good tracks in rse that sound better on game boy than oras so i agree that bit can sound just as good
pokemon,not_removed,gen is good just it has issues with pokemon variety kinda sorta fixed in platinum and game speed
pokemon,not_removed,hgss doesnt count as gen iv though in terms of judging gen ivit counts as gen ii with gen iv mechanics just as i dont count oras as how to judge gen vi supposedly while platinum was much better it still didnt fix many of the underlying problems but it was still pretty great in a lot of ways and honestly its hard to listen to dont listen to when its the same people i usually agree with on most things gaming my brother in particular has played most of the generations and iv is by far his least favorite except that it has his favorite legendaries even as someone who beat the whole thing and didnt even finish vi like i said ill go through it and play it myself eventually but i have other things on my plate as well
pokemon,not_removed,i mean i use youtube to sites on my computer but do they even work on mobile and how do i transfer windows to ios
pokemon,not_removed,i think hgss is absolutely gen iv as it features gen iv pokemon furthermore hgss arent exactly direct remakes theyre more like gold and silver flavoured remakes of crystal but the defining trait of a new gen is new pokemon and if remakes contain that gens new pokemon the remakes are in that gen hgss absolutely rounds gen iv off and significantly tributes to being one of my favourite gens
pokemon,not_removed,id imagine youd just drop the into itunes and then sync from there thats what i used to do back in at least
pokemon,not_removed,as it features gen iv pokemon not for the main gyms it doesnt and even once it goes to kanto it doesnt feature that many of them furthermore hgss arent exactly direct remakes theyre more like gold and silver flavoured remakes of crystal ehhtheyre pretty much direct remakes in every single way except in the fact that the suicune stuff behaves as it did in crystal but thats not even the main part of the game the defining traits of a new gen is the new region new music new story new settingatmosphere and new pokemon whom usually are highlighted hgss dont highlight gen ivs pokemon much at allin fact you cant even catch any without special conditions such radio station tuning on certain days being met hgss highlight gen iis pokemon its also cheating to ignore gen ivs problems that came about in dpp because hgss didnt have the same problems even though because it was remade with the same engine it did have some of the slow pace issues
pokemon,not_removed,who says gen was the worst ive never heard that ive heard people bagging on my beloved gen most often then again i thought i was the only one who dared to slander the beloved gen so what do i know platinum is the definitive game diamond and pearl were basically the beta for it i consider them unfinished personally and hgss was a nostalgia trip more than anything ill admit seeing johto in shiny new graphics was the draw also pokemon i didnt use the first time around like totodile becoming better thanks to the physicalspecial split sinnohs a cool region with good music fun pokemon a decent set of gym leaders and the most beloved and debatable best champion its just a little slow due to both grinding and certain quirks of being a dsera game the infamous saving health bar depletion etc
pokemon,not_removed,almost every list ive seen online of sites ranking the gens and my brother whos played through all of them except maybe gen i yeah not the best metric but still something ive heard people bagging on my beloved gen most often then again i thought i was the only one who dared to slander the beloved gen so what do i know thats the problem with every gen since gen iii of which gen vii seems to have broken the curse theyve all been so damn polarizing because every gen from iii to vi did some things excellently and other things terribly iii is my least favorite because while i appreciate the region and pretty okay story it also has so many bland pokemon designs too much water pointless and at times detracting gimmicks very easy difficulty and pacing issues for the first third or more of the game vi has excellent social interaction and a cool region and great pokemon designs but its also way too easy has a meh story meh characters also has pacing issues at some earlier points and lacked an interesting endgame v had the best pokemon story before vii great atmosphere and setting pretty good difficulty scaling and a huge endgame but had polarizing pokemon designs bland region design almost literally a straight line and reinforced signs of staleness for the series that had been showing up in gen iv from what ive heard but because different parts of these appealed to different people they all became so polarizing the last to receive consistent universal praise for just about every core aspect was gen ii gen vii is the most consistent gen since ii with awesome pokemon designs awesome music awesome challenges awesome overhauls in general amazing region best story and best characters says a lot when there are at least three characters who are almost definitely better than n previously considered the gold standard pokemon game character actually challenging and great pacing past the first island the biggest critiques are really just the first two hours and the fact that the online is a step down and the most beloved and debatable best champion ill trust you on your love for platinum and the reasons and will probably get to it eventually but know that this point has been debated for a while between her and blue also sun and moons champion spoiler is now surely in the running big time
pokemon,not_removed,its interesting that we dislike iii for different reasons there was a definite shift in pokemon design in iii and i didnt like it one bit i felt at the time that the designs lacked the soul of the first two gens which were much more unified in design hoenns a fairly cool region but i hated team aqua and magma they make no sense at all easily the worst villains in the mainline games which makes for the worst story as theres no story outside of the villains in pokemon games except maybesorta for vii meanwhile i agree with you on almost every point for gens v and vi the exception being your last quibble with v reinforced signs of staleness for the series that had been showing up in gen iv from what ive heard see for me gen iii was the one that was stale and showing the weaknesses of the previous gens while iv breathed new life into the series and got me to come back i guess i just valued different things than other people i appreciated the better story the badly needed physicalspecial split more pokemon designs i liked that found some ground between gen iii and gens iii better music etc just play platinum diamond and pearl might as well not exist it really is like theyre just beta versions of platinum im not quite done with moon but i think theres a reason why sun moon are receiving a lot of praise without much controversy while there are things i dont like about it so much of the game is good succeeding in multiple areas that are making most people happy
pokemon,not_removed,team aqua and magma are super mehbut they make more sense than team galactic and team flare is so bland except their music especially their leader that theyre probably the worst team of the games ive played and while they started that silly cookie cutter story formula used for four straight pokemon generations they still were at least the first ones we do agree on the pokemon designs thing thoughi dont think they needed to be unified just that they needed to be less uninspired there are some really dope pokemon from gen iii ninjask metagross the three main legendaries absol but most were super forgettable especially since the first four gym areas are mostly populated with the bland ones reinforced signs of staleness for the series that had been showing up in gen iv from what ive heard see gen iii did start the staleness trend but gen iv is generally known despite its evolutions like the physicalspecial split as being the one that really crowned pokemon being the same thing every few years with a new yet somehow visually and technologically prettyoutdated to many who dont look at the little nuances like that split gen v being mostly the same in that regard was the reinforced staleness i was referring to one very positive reviews headline for v was even if it aint brokemon dont fix it gen vi while holding a lot of the same staleness at least modernized lots of pokemon pss engine and an actually supernoticeable change to the battle formula with megaevolutions physicalspecial split was a bigger deal but megaevolutions to a casual audience was far more noticeable while there are things i dont like about it so much of the game is good succeeding in multiple areas that are making most people happy true but to go into more specifics this is the first time in a long time when i found all the fundamental bases covered when i think of the big points that define a pokemon generations quality i think of region design new pokemon story characters challenge pacing endgame content music visuals atmosphere and setting freshness gens iiivi all nailed some of these and utterly failed at at least one general consensus at least gen vii despite its issues is the first one for me since gen ii to be at least reasonably solid at all of these do the first hours suck could sos have been tweaked so it was less of a mixed bag and more of an overwhelmingly positive experience would it have been awesome to have the pss back all yes but do they cause the game to fail in any of these fundamental areas nope glad to hear youre enjoying it so far youll see what i mean by having arguably the new best champion
pokemon,not_removed,eh im not gonna defend galactic too much at least we agree that flare was awful they had potential the outfits were just silly enough and the initial reports saying that they were just in it for the money made me hopeful that we were going back to team rocketstyle motives without grandiose worlddestroying plots then lysandre happened sigh i can kind of see your point now about gens iiiv vi was a welcome change due to graphical upgrades and competent online functions even if i do hate megas and think they were pokemons jumping the shark moment yet we still got some really good brandnew mons in both vi and vii so theyre not totally out of ideas yet i am in total agreement with you about gen vii here only other criticism id add i think zmoves and alolan forms are much better than megas but they feel like symptoms of the same problem of the creative well running low if not yet dry i seem to be in the minority on those things though at least megas have been deemphasized a little even if they werent left behind in gen vi like i hoped and again like you said everything else is solid enough that i can overlook it for the most part i even used zmoves without guilt you kind of need to a lot more npcs use zmoves in alola compared to those who used megas in kalos training for the elite four at the moment cleared all four islands and what comes after excited to see the kahunas at their full strength and whoever the champion is i have some guesses
pokemon,not_removed,i even used zmoves without guilt you kind of need to a lot more npcs use zmoves in alola compared to those who used megas in kalos another reason why this game was much more challenging than gen vi i almost felt guilty using mega charizardx because very few npcs used megas and i just steamrolled them whenever mega was out even when he wasnt out i still steamrolled in vii i used zmoves without guilt because i actually needed to at times and even when id use them theyd often not be enough for the first half of the game i was like yeah ill keep away from using these as best i could it went from that to by the end i really need to use this or i wont just black outill get blown out of the water excited to see the kahunas at their full strength and whoever the champion is i have some guesses i literally just wrote out my whole experience of theorizing and finding out who it was and actually fighting said champ and i realized that it would spoil it in itself ill leave it at this very vague note though high chances are one of your guesses is correct
pokemon,not_removed,beat the game yep yeah the newest champion technically incorrect but well call this person that is pretty great and was one of my guesses though im a little disappointed that s spoiler
pokemon,not_removed,so what i was going to mention earlier about my own experience was that i started playing the guessing game around the this island and when the idea of that one being the champion came up i said to myself oh my god please let it be this person and when it was finally confirmed i just screamed to myself yyaaaassss and the pokemon are epic and the theme is epic and the way it relates to the story is epic its just amazing to relate to your point to be fair weve also see quite a few dark type elites not to mention that sun and moon dont have quite as many new dark types
pokemon,not_removed,on second thought lets not go to japan it tis a silly place
pokemon,not_removed,thats just your look on things this is pretty normal for japan
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon and guys in briefs serving me food sign me up
pokemon,not_removed,looks like a regular episode to me
pokemon,not_removed,this is more normal than i thought
pokemon,not_removed,better record this one
pokemon,not_removed,shoko nakagawa well at least it doesnt have a brazzers logo on it
pokemon,not_removed,japan is a strange place
pokemon,not_removed,im disappointed that it wasnt weirder
pokemon,not_removed,you sir win for monty python reference
pokemon,not_removed,ok
pokemon,not_removed,check her out on twitter if you like her art she has also drawn already and is getting ready to draw incineroar
pokemon,not_removed,rock type mountain badge puzzle scaling a mountain where the leader sits on the peak facing trainers on the way up consisting of steep climbs and loose ground requiring a bicycle to maneuver leader lindzey stone stephen stones daughter leads a team including lycanroc midday tyranitar aerodactyl kabutops and cradily gym so pretty good pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,gym beginner gym so first or second gym you face dual typed normalbug strategy hp recovery puzzle a dilapidated building with pitfalls stairs and ledges trainers two with one pokemon one with two pokemon leader kirby shelmet with recover leech life skitty wish cute charm ability oran berry badge darner badge iridescent bug wings
pokemon,not_removed,ice type puzzle involves a tiered glacier and you have to sorta melt so that part of it comes forward and make the glacier into like a staircase setup and you have to climb it like three times
pokemon,not_removed,cool its not even wednesday yet also rshinypokemon
pokemon,not_removed,my friend got a lvl shiny sylveon i need it
pokemon,not_removed,if it isnt fully evolved or level it is probably caught in the wild cool i guess
pokemon,not_removed,probably hacked
pokemon,not_removed,are wednesdays better for mystery trading im sort of new to all this ive always played pokemon younger but never really paid attention to shinies ivs egg moves and whatnot i just recently bought a as a nostalgia pokemon trip and am learning new stuff on this sub
pokemon,not_removed,i got a level shiny machamp probably hacked though so i guess it doesnt really count sylveons are so cool though lucky him
pokemon,not_removed,hopefully i got a lvl shiny machamp before that really didnt seem legit so i kinda ruled it out but that one seems pretty normal so theres that
pokemon,not_removed,why would you say that is that because legit shinies in trades are so rare im rather new to mystery trades
pokemon,not_removed,yup on wednesday most people send out better things shinies perfect ivs pokerus usually all hacked or wondertrade not mystery trade wednesday
pokemon,not_removed,even if someone doesnt like the shiny they rarely trade it off if for some reason they do they would do it only if they knew they were getting something good like a legendary to mystery trade it off they surely they must have hacked in multiple of that shiny or know that they can hack in another one
pokemon,not_removed,youre right wonder trades the name woops good to know though thanks
pokemon,not_removed,i think you mean the new new plates
pokemon,not_removed,aaah if only i could locate a new nintendo for a decent price these plates are sick
pokemon,not_removed,nice though personally im still trying to find clear plates for the same model to put my own design on it to no avail so far
pokemon,not_removed,where can i get one
pokemon,not_removed,i just want a protective case i find it odd i havent found any
pokemon,not_removed,yeah me too i gotta grab a set for myself
pokemon,not_removed,i just bought a now im kicking my ass for not going
pokemon,not_removed,i have the same ones d
pokemon,not_removed,i have these too love it its subtle but awesome also helps me keep my limited edition red and blue cover plates in prestine condition
pokemon,not_removed,i love the look of this cover but i do not love the feel way too glossy i really prefer the matte finish of the redblue covers
pokemon,not_removed,i just have the pokemon redpokemon blue faceplates need to get me this one
pokemon,not_removed,you can get the standard sized one in the us now you just need to buy the animal crossing bundle that includes the us one
pokemon,not_removed,rip
pokemon,not_removed,is there no cover plates for the xl
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i preordered these when they were announced and then found out they dont fit the xl
pokemon,not_removed,nintendo store or amazon
pokemon,not_removed,if you are in the us you cant
pokemon,not_removed,there are a lot more in japan check sites like playasia and otherwise hori is making a pikachu one for the us and its on amazon for preorder ill see if i can link you later
pokemon,not_removed,meh your not missing much when it comes to pokemon i got a in with alpha sapphire and loved it just sold it and got a new xl in preparation for sunmoon the got me back into pokemon after many years the is the most comfortable to hold and the screens are the sharpest it took a bit of getting used to the relatively pixelated xl display i was excited to finally try the on playthroughs of as and y versionbut was disappointed tbh the frame rate in battles is not only much lower it is inconsistent and choppy there are some effects out of battles and they look great but doesnt really contribute much to the game imo dont kick yourself unless they sort out the battles for sunmoon
pokemon,not_removed,honestly you dont get much i cant see yet have had a since they were released and never once have i thought man i wonder what this would be like im pokémon games are great how they are
pokemon,not_removed,i never have my on if i do its when i first get a game and its only on for minutes or so
pokemon,not_removed,the japanese ones are region locked the only ones available in the us is the happy home designer bundle and the pokémon redblue bundle
pokemon,not_removed,well im in the us and got mine through amazon so i guess thats not true
pokemon,not_removed,awesome good to hear im just getting back into pokemon and im loving omegaruby ill most likely buy sunmoon when theyre out seems crazy to pay an extra just for some and a foldable case
pokemon,not_removed,that was how i justified getting the so its nice to hear i wasnt wrong
pokemon,not_removed,damn
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i thought i was replying to someone asking about protective cases but must have clicked on the wrong comment
pokemon,not_removed,but arent they region locked the only new i could find on amazon are from different countries and wont play north american games
pokemon,not_removed,which is why its super unfortunate the new only has a couple limited run units here in the us either the animal crossing happy home designer bundle or the pokémon redblue bundles
pokemon,not_removed,if youre talking about the new only a couple special edition ones are available in the us doesnt really matter which version you get though because the cover plates are interchangeable the cover plates are not region locked though p i did need to wait a couple months for amazon to sell these at a reasonable price though
pokemon,not_removed,yes im talking about the new standard size that for some reason is not sold in the us only the xl is available i dont want the xl because it is too bulky and the screen dpi is absolutely horrible if the regular size is not released in america by the time pokémon sun and moon come out i am just going to get the because it is cheaper and has a better screen
pokemon,not_removed,the new standard size had a couple of limited runs here in the us animal crossing and pokemon redblue
pokemon,not_removed,why this pose
pokemon,not_removed,big booty bitches
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,look at the artists other works
pokemon,not_removed,source
pokemon,not_removed,its not the first pokemon to only evolve if its female ie combee
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,ah yes combee well who in their right mind ever caught a combee to add to their team you not only had to want it but had to actually do the whole honey tree ritual i still think salandit is the worst offender cause thats a pokémon youd expect a lot of people to want and get for their team and idk whether combee had gender ratio or if its weighted like salandit
pokemon,not_removed,thanks edit im the one that received it thanks again
pokemon,not_removed,yay edit not working the first time i tried it said you cannot receive then i tried again it says already received wth thanks anyway
pokemon,not_removed,in short nintendo confirmed the fact that it would be supporting both simplified and traditional chinese in pokemon sun and pokemon moon for a simultaneous release across mainland china hong kong and taiwan – giving fans yet another way to play while many were initially excited by this prospect it has turned into a significant localization change it turns out that this means beloved and iconic beasts like pikachu will receive a name change pikachu was originally translated as 比卡超 beikaachyu in hong kong now it is named 皮卡丘 pikaqiu while the name 皮卡丘 in mandarin sounds similar to the global name pikachu as it was always called in china and taiwan it reads as peikaajau in cantonese which doesnt sound the same at all
pokemon,not_removed,still a bit sleepy so forgive me if im wrong but the problem here seems to be that people in hong kong are furious that the charachters arent using the same name as in cantonese due to pokémon using mandarin for the language and since they want to conserve the language of cantonese they want nintendo to add those translations to the game too youd think that cantonese would be in the game seeing gen
pokemon,not_removed,afaik this is the first chinese pokemon release they shouldve monitored translations of names in the anime
pokemon,not_removed,yes but doesnt china have like a lot of bootlegs of the ds games
pokemon,not_removed,not sure if so then those bootlegs use pei kaa yau already
pokemon,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡° that buldge on the guy in the center with the blue speedo
pokemon,not_removed,love it
pokemon,not_removed,now i want shiny pikipek to have yellow instead of res
pokemon,not_removed,haha this is great if sorry when you get more friends together you should extend it d infinitely long tree of friends
pokemon,not_removed,someone plays mount your friends
pokemon,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡° you can mount me
pokemon,not_removed,sun and moon has no national pokedex only the regional national dex has been moved to pokebank and syncs with all your games
pokemon,not_removed,traitor all hail helix
pokemon,not_removed,i want to see the rest of the eeveelutions fused with ninetails that would be awesome
pokemon,not_removed,ninetales
pokemon,not_removed,rukia my froslass
pokemon,not_removed,jolteon as naruto
pokemon,not_removed,i name either my lucario or my greninja black star from soul eater
pokemon,not_removed,gallade as kamina
pokemon,not_removed,i dont nickname my pokemon unless they have proven to be very useful to me the last one wasnt named after an anime character but it was a character from a jrpg i named my mega altaria after tsubasa from tokyo mirage sessions purely because when playing cipher my friend pointed out how weird tsubasa looked dressed as a high school student next to marth and ike
pokemon,not_removed,my first soulsilver run i named everyone after gash bell characters typhlosion was unagon magnezone was gash honchkrow was layla mamoswine was karudio and pinsir was victoreem
pokemon,not_removed,igneel the charizard holding charizardite x
pokemon,not_removed,i always named my murkrow itachi
pokemon,not_removed,gigantor the golurk
pokemon,not_removed,im going to name a slurpuff ruruka and a zangooze izayoi or maybe the final litten gozu or nekomaru
pokemon,not_removed,i like naming mine after a persona with a comparable arcana like aeon fairy so i call my sylveon kaguya im gonna start using ygo names as well mimikkyu as ghostrick is too perfect
pokemon,not_removed,i nickname all of mine i think the only i can think of bases of anime are pikachu y biribiri toaru majutsu no index glaceon y weiss rwby if that counts
pokemon,not_removed,goku as infernape
pokemon,not_removed,i named my zygarde kuroha kagerou project my cosplay pikachu is in its cute outfit and named momo kagerou project my shiny charizard is named mikoto k and i believe i named my virizion bishamoten noragami i think thats it for now however i kind of plan on naming a litten kano when i get one kagerou project again
pokemon,not_removed,litten is definitely jibanyan
pokemon,not_removed,i call absol ichise from texhnolyze
pokemon,not_removed,i need a shiny female greninja to name mikasa

pokemon,not_removed,well i always name the roserades i use in my generation run akiza after the akiza from yugioh
pokemon,not_removed,i named my pikachu pikachu at one point
pokemon,not_removed,named my lucario goku
pokemon,not_removed,eyy i always named my jolteon after rukia
pokemon,not_removed,do it
pokemon,not_removed,i think i would name him laxus or zatch bell
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i never really named her based off a resemblance i just think its a cute as hell name for a cute as hell little pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,well hide and hope your soul isnt taken
pokemon,not_removed,i can see humanity rocking gladions fashion
pokemon,not_removed,oh shit
pokemon,not_removed,i imagine i wouldnt live long i would see a shinx and would either squeal about how cute it is or stand befuddled as to why there is a creature that looks exactly like a pokemon on earth before getting shocked to death as for the rest of the world it probably wouldnt be as bad as getting other pokemon but if they evolve into luxray it would be difficult to run and hide
pokemon,not_removed,grimer so people would leave me alone
pokemon,not_removed,if legendaries are allowed mew it can turn into any pokémon without having to see them first since its the ancestor of all pokémon if not espeon its crucial to have your pokémon be able to communicate with you so you need a psychic type plus its strong and freaking adorable
pokemon,not_removed,lucario my bro
pokemon,not_removed,chimecho i really like this pokemon and it is small enough to with me anywhere plus it is psychic type which makes for good communication and easy moving of objects
pokemon,not_removed,raichu ive just always liked raichu or a deerling i like deer
pokemon,not_removed,infernape or greninja
pokemon,not_removed,marowak
pokemon,not_removed,zoroark especially the shiny version since its my favorite shiny i would have it impersonate me during class since i already barely talk as it is
pokemon,not_removed,mine would be slurpuff cuz its cuddly and adorable its also pretty sweet more sweet than arcanine for sure
pokemon,not_removed,id also probably pick a growlithe however i might pick a wobuffet for some shieldy reasons
pokemon,not_removed,abra sleeps teleports enjoys the greener things in life my spirit animal
pokemon,not_removed,ditto i had a dream about this and ditto seemed the best however careerwise if i was a trainer itd be a smeargle
pokemon,not_removed,i think id choose something that i could fly on like a charizard or dragonite but id love to have a gengar to freak people out with
pokemon,not_removed,venonat because it evolves into venomoth and venomoth is cool
pokemon,not_removed,a haunter probably maybe a grimer
pokemon,not_removed,talonflame because who doesnt want to ride a cool flame hawk
pokemon,not_removed,id want a garchomp because supersonic flying landsharks are frikkin awesome
pokemon,not_removed,growlithe andor arcanine for the same reasons as op if i could have two the second would be goodra slimy hugs
pokemon,not_removed,id take something that can use fly because you dont have to worry about getting in to a car crash when im flying around on my own personal pidgeot
pokemon,not_removed,a tiny zapdos so it can actually follow me around i can ride on it and zapdos is cool
pokemon,not_removed,mew for hax transformpsychic best deal ever actually id need to think about it
pokemon,not_removed,eevee cause its eevee yo
pokemon,not_removed,heracross hands down i love insects and it could help me with some heavy lifting
pokemon,not_removed,good choice any reason why marowak or just a fan
pokemon,not_removed,hahaha good choice never thought about the sitting in class for me aspect i may have to change my answer now
pokemon,not_removed,are those fighting words in all honesty i like slurpuff dont hurt me
pokemon,not_removed,haha good choice
pokemon,not_removed,haha having a ghost type would be sweet sometimes for sure
pokemon,not_removed,seriously though that would be amazing
pokemon,not_removed,just a fan i think hes mysterious and has a darker side than most pokemon and unfortunately i have more in common with it than others having lost my father at a young age i always use a lonely or quiet natured one as well just seems fitting for a marowak
pokemon,not_removed,you dont want to fight me sweet you have a good taste arcanine is pretty cool too
pokemon,not_removed,source

pokemon,not_removed,i never bothered to train my pokémon to level but because of the great amount of postgame content in gen that actually provided exp i managed to get my samurott up to through completely ordinary play in both of my games even after that accomplishment ive been trying to do the same with some of my other favourites and now i have a nice lv team consisting of my iron island lucario ns zoroark my starter samurott dianthas gardevoir stevens metagross my starter charizard and a ferrothorn arcanine meowsticf and a few legendaries such as zekrom black kyurem yveltal and the weather trio all used on my teams in my playthroughs of b y or and as

pokemon,not_removed,blastoise in blue which was the only pokemon i battled with since i was like and didnt really get the mechanics
pokemon,not_removed,fletchinder in x used for flying around and hatching eggs i didnt evolve it because i wanted to keep him separate from talonflame i would use for battles my second one was bellsprout i used for horde battles i didnt evolve her because i love her animations
pokemon,not_removed,a haunter named gaspar in diamond i was too young to know how to evolve it
pokemon,not_removed,my mew i got in soulsilver beat the whole game with just that mew

pokemon,not_removed,torterra because i was that one guy who only trained their starter
pokemon,not_removed,pelipper from ruby d
pokemon,not_removed,a chimchar year old me refused to evolve in diamond i was a mess
pokemon,not_removed,alakazam in ruby version that was actually the first and only time i trained an entire team to lvl oh to be years old with endless free time again
pokemon,not_removed,alakazam in blue
pokemon,not_removed,articuno on crystal i wasnt a very proud person back then still not
pokemon,not_removed,venisaur in leafgreen trained it before the elite by going as far as possible until i died

pokemon,not_removed,my blastoise from my pokemon red many years ago shame the internal batteries for that game have long since died
pokemon,not_removed,smogonbird in x y in case you couldnt tell im a bit of a newcomer to the pokemon series
pokemon,not_removed,my blazikin i played through x with
pokemon,not_removed,my pigeot in pokemon yellow i absolutely loved that guy i wish i could find my old copy my copy or crystal doesnt work any more either my gbc wont read it
pokemon,not_removed,blastoise in firered had surf waterfall strength and rock smash because i was and had never heard of hm slaves or move deleters
pokemon,not_removed,mine was pidgeot in yellow version only pokémon i used the entire game it was level by the elite four from grinding lol i was such a dumb child
pokemon,not_removed,it was my blaziken on ruby named devastator i was like nine years old so he was pretty freaking bda
pokemon,not_removed,blastoise in pokemon blue
pokemon,not_removed,my pidgeot in pokémon gold that thing was unstoppable
pokemon,not_removed,gen blastoise gen allakhazam gen gardevoir gen infernape gen chandelure gen venusaur
pokemon,not_removed,it was this thread that made me realise i never trained any of my pokemon to level damn i need to do something about that
pokemon,not_removed,most likely blastoise on gbc pokemon blue i was like its a vague memory
pokemon,not_removed,excluding the legendaries you catch at lvl the highest ive ever gotten a pokemon is my lvl blastoise in x i dont think ive even hit just playing through a game
pokemon,not_removed,typloshion in crystal i basically used him the entire game i miss my dude
pokemon,not_removed,my infernape from diamond or platinum its been so long that i forget which sinnoh game it was
pokemon,not_removed,my max iv farfetched named leekspin
pokemon,not_removed,typhlosion in gold version he was a champ all the way even after my sister started a new game and erased him
pokemon,not_removed,i accidentally left a parasect in the day care of red version for a really long time when i got him out he was level
pokemon,not_removed,staraptor
pokemon,not_removed,mewtwo traded over to silver
pokemon,not_removed,infernape on diamond firstever pokémon
pokemon,not_removed,charizard or venusaur pokémon red i had both finished game restarted to play again but i cant actually remember which i got first sure that charizard was first as i was years old and he would have been my favourite
pokemon,not_removed,a female empoleon sadly i dont have her anymore
pokemon,not_removed,empoleon in diamond it was near the place you got taught hydro cannon sadly my file got corrupted and he was lost foreverrip bubbles 😭❤️
pokemon,not_removed,my togetic in silver version
pokemon,not_removed,blastoise the badass
pokemon,not_removed,my best guess would be pikachu in yellow in rb i cheated with the missing no glitch
pokemon,not_removed,tyranitar in soul silver
pokemon,not_removed,venusaur from leaf green years ago or so still have him in my collection
pokemon,not_removed,been playing since and still have never raised one to lv mainly because ive been playing hg the most and grinding on it is quite difficult instakilling the elite time after time wears thin and i was more focused on getting many things to than taking one all the way to
pokemon,not_removed,aron
pokemon,not_removed,espeon on colosseum
pokemon,not_removed,mewtwo in red wayy back when
pokemon,not_removed,my swampert from ruby but it didnt hit til leafgreen
pokemon,not_removed,blastoise in blue i rarely train anything to level only my blazikenlatiosrayquazashiny sharpedo from sapphire and a tyrantrum in x have been trained to level legit in the past four generations everything else was pokegend probably
pokemon,not_removed,my enpoleon in diamond version for whatever reason i let the last knock out be a pokemon at the lake by the starting town i think it was a starly
pokemon,not_removed,my magmortor in platinum was the first i can actually remember not sure if i had one prior to that though been so long
pokemon,not_removed,gyarados achieved exclusively via rare candies i got from missingo
pokemon,not_removed,delphox actually in x highest i had before then was in the or my typhlosion in heartgold that same one is now and hacked to have perfect ivs and is in my box in omegaruby i think aside from those i have had level emboars and thats it for stuff ive trained personally
pokemon,not_removed,vaporeon
pokemon,not_removed,latias in sapphire followed by blaziken
pokemon,not_removed,my little brothers was a minun
pokemon,not_removed,torterra my brother and i decided to solo diamond with it
pokemon,not_removed,probably kyogre back when sapphire and ruby first came out i usually dont use legends but kyogre holds a special place for me for some reason i also frequently used to use rayquaza and max it out as well
pokemon,not_removed,my lapras in blue
pokemon,not_removed,my cyndaquil from ss charizard has always been my all time favourite but cyndaquil was my favourite starter wasnt a fan of its evolutions either used it throughout ss white and the moves it to yoras
pokemon,not_removed,infernape in platinum
pokemon,not_removed,not counting rare candy cheat in gen i i dont think i raised anything to level until gen v i usually got to before id restart for some other kind of run i think it was zoroark or dragonite cant remember which zoroark only got there though because of the poor ai trick at the for those who dont know you could go through the entire psychic team without taking a hit if you put zoroark in the front and something neutral or weak to psychic in the back dragonite was the first pokemon i intentionally leveled to
pokemon,not_removed,either rayquaza or blaziken in sapphire
pokemon,not_removed,in silver i had a lvl typhlosion and pidgeot until i took it to a friends house and it got stolen we no longer speak
pokemon,not_removed,you too
pokemon,not_removed,mewtwo in firered i used the vs seeker over and over on those bikers at the top of cycling road
pokemon,not_removed,shelly the blastoise from fire red still the best blastoise ive ever had to this day
pokemon,not_removed,my first one was when i used gameshark to get unlimited rare candies for my charizard on firered but the first one without cheating was my blaziken
pokemon,not_removed,a flygon on an emerald playthrough it has been the only legitimate level pokemon i have ever raised
pokemon,not_removed,haunter from the missingno glitch just had him in one battle and bang from something down to glitches are fun like that i dont think i ever bothered to level anything to legitimately until leaf green or something when i started using mr mime because it got boosted exp from being traded pokemon stadium usually only needed level pokemon as the max anyway
pokemon,not_removed,other than red and blue rare candy glitch mine was mew
pokemon,not_removed,jolteon in leaf green he was the eevee i was given in the story mode
pokemon,not_removed,my first legit level was a gengar i got it as a level haunter from wonder trade
pokemon,not_removed,my charizard in blue version once i discovered the missingno item dupe glitch and got infinite rare candies
pokemon,not_removed,my first true was my tyranitar in crystal however i had all at lvl in my red version thanks to missingno
pokemon,not_removed,a pidgeot in blue that i got up to with glitched rare candies aaaah to be years old again
pokemon,not_removed,honestly i dont remember it was either chesnaught greninja or charizard snowbelle forest is a great place for high level pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,manaphy in my platinum yes i went that long without getting a level i think my pigeot in red was but manaphy was my first legit level
pokemon,not_removed,something that i caught using the missingno glitch in pokemon red and to this day i havent gotten a legit one havent had y and or long enough yet p
pokemon,not_removed,same blastoise in blue
pokemon,not_removed,what season
pokemon,not_removed,same i played the shit out of emerald for like a year and a half until it got stolen im honestly not sure how it managed to hold my interest so much for so long still miss that blaziken plus his azumarill sidekick
pokemon,not_removed,me too flame wheels for days
pokemon,not_removed,same combo then i tried the cloning glitch and somehow he got deleted rip
pokemon,not_removed,sting like an onix kick like a bruce
pokemon,not_removed,another azumarill fan yay
pokemon,not_removed,same here buddy i just used my swampert in sapphire which was my first video game ever i played and loved it but didnt understand why i should use other pokemon if i could just beat the game with swampert i just remember thinking how cute mudkip was and then when it evolved i remember thinking it looked so ugly and was hoping if i got level it would evolve again or something xd
pokemon,not_removed,mystery dungeon explorers of the sky ahhh so much feelings
pokemon,not_removed,its ok ill never evolve my chespin as long as i live
pokemon,not_removed,i have never either mostly because i got preoccupied with levelling up other pokemon to level or breeding for wonder trades and stuff
pokemon,not_removed,same here i played pokemon since i was very young when i was a little bit older around the time of rse i played my blue for old times sake and i had a lvl blastoise and i hadnt moved past route
pokemon,not_removed,spring gotta have the flowers man also that was the season i found her in it sorta feels wrong to change it
pokemon,not_removed,sorry for your loss emerald was a great game
pokemon,not_removed,yay its my favorite pokemon i thought i was the only one d
pokemon,not_removed,it was almost a decade ago and im still not over it oras was a nice way to reexperience it though
pokemon,not_removed,its been my favorite since i used it in my playthrough of x used it in every game since even bred a perfect iv adamant one for battling use
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i love oras its the first game i got seriously into it and learned everything about and its so in depth
pokemon,not_removed,cool i normally use mine to shut down my friends dragon shenanigans
pokemon,not_removed,i actually didnt really play it much after the delta episode but all the excitement for sumo has me training pokémon and hunting legendaries like i used to
pokemon,not_removed,haha that certainly works
pokemon,not_removed,yeah it does well have a lovely day
pokemon,not_removed,slaqueen
pokemon,not_removed,before anybody says it all stats on magikarp
pokemon,not_removed,give sceptile physical attack so you can actually use leafblade
pokemon,not_removed,the only thing i have really ever wanted is for golduck to be faster hes listed as the fastest swimming pokemon but gets outsped by a fucking poliwag hes pretty bulky though and i like his versatile movepool justthat damn speed man too slow
pokemon,not_removed,i personally think that the dratini dragonair dragonite line should be special attackers more than physical considering it can learn some pretty damn powerful special moves
pokemon,not_removed,i would make hydreigon base speed or even base speed if i ever really get to it hydreigon was destined for greatness but he had to have base hp and base speed base speed is what made hydreigon the saddest pseudolegendary ever whats it going to outspeed it has more than enough speed to beat every pokemon who doesnt need speed it has just the right amount of speed to be outsped by every pokemon that actually has decent speed speed is an important speed tier and they had to taunt him with speed on the other hand garchomp gets speed
pokemon,not_removed,i would swap sceptiles atk and sp atk
pokemon,not_removed,get gamefreak on the phone now
pokemon,not_removed,hes listed as the fastest swimming pokemon but gets outsped by a fucking poliwag to be fair poliwag is pretty fast for a first stage mon its speed actually goes down once its fully evolved
pokemon,not_removed,why give dragonite hurricane if it can barely use it
pokemon,not_removed,youre so close to gladion lanas trial and the nightmare known as totem wishiwashi im looking forward to your interpretation of those things
pokemon,not_removed,follow the link for more
pokemon,not_removed,part of me wonders if the author is going to get steamrolled by haus alolan raichu on ula ula
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon is metal af
pokemon,not_removed,cant wait for next week your comics are always funny
pokemon,not_removed,that last panel is excellent i love the tone of these comics
pokemon,not_removed,is it ok if i imagine the main characters voice is a kind of parody of the comic book guy from the simpsons
pokemon,not_removed,please have jhall wearing a shirt that looks like machamps chestbelt its perfect for his character
pokemon,not_removed,nightmare known as totem wishiwashi dont worry its not like totem wishiwashi would call in a healer
pokemon,not_removed,fuck me i remember fighting that with only a brionne that knew bubble beam never had a more intense battle in a pokemon game story before aside from maybe cynthia my very first time as a kid
pokemon,not_removed,i cant wait to see gladion mainly his hand
pokemon,not_removed,nightmare i one shot it with my starter
pokemon,not_removed,i feared totem wishiwashi for weeks and wouldnt dare touching my when i finally did i just used my kadabra and took out half of its health before just using brionnes fairytype move
pokemon,not_removed,what i beat that thing in like seconds
pokemon,not_removed,haha hi remember when you kept beating me and even told me to go to hell well its your turn
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i remember that please i can beat you with my eyes closed here take on my sandygast i dare you what could you possibly oneshot and then he proceeded to obliterate about half my team with just that fucking raichu
pokemon,not_removed,are you telling me the game gets harder i hadnt played since emerald and picked up a sun copy its fun and all but there are no challenging parts and i definitely miss that from the old games ill find myself thinking how badass my team is and then i gotta step off my high horse and remember everyone else is that bad ass too cuz the game is so easy xd
pokemon,not_removed,you might want to see a doctor that edge sure is sharp
pokemon,not_removed,i guess i got lucky then i played through moon once and sun times now and it called the wishiwashi all but one time the one time it didnt i one shot it anyway
pokemon,not_removed,hes using a torracat a crabrawler and a trumbeak hes not going to have a good time if he has no counters
pokemon,not_removed,same i keep seeing it mentioned around here and i had to look up what part of the game it showed up in
pokemon,not_removed,if you are a new player and desire a challenge i recommend turning off exp share game freak managed to solve the keep pokemon accessible to everyone issue by having the exp share serve as the games unofficial easy mode they changed the formula so that when its active your lead pokemon gets the full exp while all other party members get of the exp each depending on how many team members you have that lets you effectively gain anywhere from to extra exp per battle this usually ends up with you being overleveled at many points sun and moon are actually considered one of the hardest pokemon games to date purely due to the developers being very creative with npc battle tactics but the exp share hides that by ensuring players always have enough exp to bulldoze their way past everything with brute force if need be if you want to experience the games full challenge turn it off and change battle style to set youll end up with a game where you are either on par or below the levels of your opponents get no free switches and youll have to outplay them through your own cunning for reference my team of three was definitely on par with totem wishiwashi during its fight whereas a friend who enabled exp share ended up being levels higher despite carrying a full team of six the game is practically night and day in terms of difficulty
pokemon,not_removed,you think i am the edgy one when that last panel exists okay sure
pokemon,not_removed,all you have to do is not kill the wishiwashi same thing goes for toten lurantis i killed the bird and after it summoned the cast form i killed the totem
pokemon,not_removed,i soloed it with torracat because it had hp electric
pokemon,not_removed,dude thank you i definitely had no idea about this and am going to turn off share exp for sure i appreciate the detailed response too
pokemon,not_removed,i know im just saying that i never had to deal with the alomomola because the one time it showed up i killed the totem in one hit anyway
pokemon,not_removed,wait castform wasnt the hard partner on that one that one gave me the secondmost amount of shit castform countered anything i threw out for lurantis and vice versa i finally had to break out the zcrystal to beat that damn thing
pokemon,not_removed,yes sunmoons story mode has definitely been the most fun ive had with any pokemon game so far in terms of its ingame battles and ive played every gen it consistently keeps you on your toes with unexpected tactics such as guzmas unorthodox battle tactic and the various totem pokemon even seemingly easy fights are tough such as with nanus persian doing way more damage than expected and the champion fight is definitely one of the toughest final bosses in the setting which is impressive because he doesnt use any pseudo legends like cynthias garchomp or stevens metagross he comes at you with things like braviary snorlax and magnezone yet still manages to prove himself tough because his team holds excellent coverage and has a battle tactic totem fights end up being really enjoyable too except sophocles his really sucked out of curiosity how far are you currently in the game if you havent gone that far you may still be able to experience most of the fun
pokemon,not_removed,i killed the totem before the castform can do any cheeky shit sadly i actually still had trouble with the totem even though i didnt even fight it with the castform i had a dartrix and the super effective peck was annoying from the bird
pokemon,not_removed,eq bye bye
pokemon,not_removed,great just what we need more jellyfish from aether
pokemon,not_removed,this individual is truly exemplary even among all those i have seen the poor beast i will love it
pokemon,not_removed,i must agree that is indeed a wonderful mon where can i find more of these
pokemon,not_removed,i think what everyone is overlooking is that the pc is supposed to be you and i dont think they wanted to assume who you are and your reaction what if they had made the character roll their eyes when you were actually going with the not bad obama face it would have been just as jarring except now the character would have a personality to be assumed rather than a puppet for you to project on to
pokemon,not_removed,destiny year ptsd
pokemon,not_removed,you dont have to be assuming anyones personality by giving them a natural human reaction to seeing the world burn or making them at least frown when their dear friend is leaving moreover theyre already assuming your personality with the dialogue choices they provide you with what if when my mom asks me why i chose this pokemon my real answer is neither because it was cool nor cute i really dont think assuming your personality is the issue here nor what they were trying to avoid cause they didnt anyway and even if itd be the case id honestly rather have them make a personality for my character than having a soulless sociopath while everyone else has a personality and natural human reactions to events
pokemon,not_removed,hey i think it would be a cool idea to paint them in only their primary colours
pokemon,not_removed,are you gonna paint the shit out of those fuckers i mean they look great but damn fucking pokémon warhammers amiright they still look awesome though i just have a thing against green did i mention they looked pretty damn cool
pokemon,not_removed,my mom is a teacher at marysville arts and technology high school in washington the students used a printer to make them
pokemon,not_removed,those would be really cool pieces for a board game
pokemon,not_removed,one of these things is not like the others
pokemon,not_removed,like those pokémon yellow sprites
pokemon,not_removed,dont know about op but the proper way to do this is to do an acetone bath and print them using the correct colored filament from the start
pokemon,not_removed,i almost think they look better unpainted
pokemon,not_removed,i recognize these files theyre easily my favorite pokemon models on thingiverse made by a user named flowalistik ive gifted these myself haha
pokemon,not_removed,shadypenguin is freaking hot as heck so im glad he got the best looking fish ever
pokemon,not_removed,oh god the jwittz ttube and gian ones made me laugh more than i should of if you count him rogersbase would be this
pokemon,not_removed,this is pretty accurate
pokemon,not_removed,httpgoogledhnpb
pokemon,not_removed,thats easy
pokemon,not_removed,i think the global link is undergoing its weekly maintenance perfect time to start the mission too bad they didnt announce any sort of special reward maybe theyll do it when the global link comes back online it was real nice when there was more than just festival coins
pokemon,not_removed,ugh keep on forcing me to complete the game all i want is my shiny mimikyu is that too much to ask for
pokemon,not_removed,thats a surprisingly low goal any news on what the reward is
pokemon,not_removed,do the ones from pokemon bank count
pokemon,not_removed,it seems like a small goal but i wonder if there is a limit on how much an individual player can contribute
pokemon,not_removed,i found out about while unlocking my battle team wanted to put in a mega in my team only competitive mega is my scizor could evolve my kadabra or transfer salamence
pokemon,not_removed,ive been in the smogon thread for the tree for ages and i basically only play the game to play the tree anymore by the time i get the two stamps doubles and multi i bet id have earned enough bp to complete it by myself lol for the record im using dragoniteaegislashlele for singles dragonitemegamenceaegislashblaziken for doubles and megamenceaegislash wcynthias megacariogarchomp for multi
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,i can easily get in one day and im only semicompetitive so we only need of me
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt manage to see the deadline but i think i saw that its meant to be earned at the battle tree lost gl connection right after
pokemon,not_removed,yeah it seems like it would only take a few hundred people if they go all outi got more than yesterday on my own in just a few hours
pokemon,not_removed,if we get in total we get a heavy ball
pokemon,not_removed,found first encounter two nights ago so good luck
pokemon,not_removed,rare candy and heavy ball i never got the ball from the last mission
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think so since it mentions the battle tree
pokemon,not_removed,the limit is i think
pokemon,not_removed,in the multibattles can both you and your partner mega evolve your pokemon i havent gotten into the battle facilities until this gen and im waiting to be able to scout cynthia before i take on the super multi i beat the regular multi but my partner never mega evolved
pokemon,not_removed,yes is getting bp from the battle tree it was announce after the end of the previous one we just didnt know the goal and the prize
pokemon,not_removed,thanks hope you find your next shiny soon too
pokemon,not_removed,shit i have like a thousand battle points waiting for me in bank
pokemon,not_removed,yes since there trainers
pokemon,not_removed,you account need it to be link and you needed to get trades
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think so according to the mission if we got million we got the ball
pokemon,not_removed,did they ever pass out the wonder cards for that i never got mine
pokemon,not_removed,people were saying that the five trades were only for the candies and everyone on pgl would get the ball im still so pissed about that
pokemon,not_removed,here follow the instructions in this thread
pokemon,not_removed,yes you needed to go to the website and find the link
pokemon,not_removed,go to the pgl site and claim it
pokemon,not_removed,thank you
pokemon,not_removed,i know gamefreak is currently working on gen sequel for switch code name as star this is a rumor and there is no official confirmation on that in fact they want to sell how the switch perform before they think about porting pokemon games in there
pokemon,not_removed,they said sm took three years so maybe
pokemon,not_removed,of course theyre working on gen
pokemon,not_removed,its obviously going be on the switch we really dont have enough proof of this to spout out claims like that its entirely possible for them to make a handheld and console version of gen to get people to buy the switch version they could add extra modes that the handheld cant handlefit but still keep the base games the same like smash bros did that scenario is currently just as possible as there only being a switch version or only being on handheld if the switch somehow becomes a giant flop i really doubt there will ever be a console version obviously dont want the switch to flop but the possibility is always there
pokemon,not_removed,this isnt just a rumor there are tons of proof that sunmoon sequel will actually come you see those under construction area around alola region right that is a big hint those under construction is going to be a gym
pokemon,not_removed,source please can you give me a link of that interview im really want to read it because i doubt sunmoon will last that long only marshadow left as a mythical pokemon to destribution in the movie this year
pokemon,not_removed,it looks great just a question though whats that gray part near machamps torso area it kinda looks like a rock
pokemon,not_removed,i hope its a rock
pokemon,not_removed,that was supposed to be his leg lol oops
pokemon,not_removed,oh ok now i see it lol sorry for the misunderstanding
pokemon,not_removed,your failure to use a tie somewhere in its construction to fully complete that pun pains me p awesome work as usual uthelittlethingy
pokemon,not_removed,shades of mimikyu
pokemon,not_removed,darkrai mimikyu it should be called mimikrai
pokemon,not_removed,ooo i shouldve watch the move before making the pun sorry for that btw thank you for the flair i love it
pokemon,not_removed,or darkmikyu
pokemon,not_removed,so cute
pokemon,not_removed,the bug badge is upside down other than that this is great
pokemon,not_removed,oh shoot thanks theyre actually pins so ill take it out and fix it
pokemon,not_removed,thats incredible any chance i could get that as an stl id love to print it on my printer id even send you one if you wanted charizard has been my favorite for the last years
pokemon,not_removed,while i certainly couldnt do anywhere as well as you did the only piece of feedback i could really give on it is the head seems too genericdragon it lacks character in my opinion i feel it needs to be slightly boxier but still looks great overall
pokemon,not_removed,but its somehow not a dragon typelol
pokemon,not_removed,thanks for you appreciation of my art unfortunately though whilst i appreciate your offer i do intend to print mould cast and paint these guys myself rpokemon will be the first to know once i list him up on ebay whats the printer you have and which country do you live in though
pokemon,not_removed,thanks for your feedback ill keep that in mind for future sculpts
pokemon,not_removed,yeahat least they fixed it for the mega evolution
pokemon,not_removed,aw thats too bad i understand though i live in the us and i am printing on a currently
pokemon,not_removed,oh interesting the print volume on that is huge right
pokemon,not_removed,not as big as the which goes up to tall but yeah i can make some pretty awesome and big prints
pokemon,not_removed,nice job but is arcanine that tall
pokemon,not_removed,do you only have or am i crazy
pokemon,not_removed,i love the starter choice and overall great type diversity
pokemon,not_removed,this looks great was your last slot rotating
pokemon,not_removed,according to the pokedex i was really surprised when i looked it up all the heights are pretty close edit typo
pokemon,not_removed,wait people need more than
pokemon,not_removed,im tryna spot a as well
pokemon,not_removed,thanks i went the standard of everything team xd i had toucannon on my team until i got mimikyu then i fell in love
pokemon,not_removed,it was until i got my mimikyu then i kept it the whole game so this was the team from the ghost trial until the end
pokemon,not_removed,i think dog pokemon are head to tail
pokemon,not_removed,what are you some bug trainer npc
pokemon,not_removed,i only count five unless thats a ditto in the middle or im blind xd
pokemon,not_removed,i mean
pokemon,not_removed,i mean youngster joey isnt someone to
pokemon,not_removed,i cant see how that gigantic tree on one of the islands doesnt have anything to do with zygarde
pokemon,not_removed,that list i think thats the one from vp a while ago by a person who called themselves leaky lillie thats only an excerpt of what they said they also said that zygardes formes wouldnt be in sm or something along the lines of that im going to go through a archive site and see if i can find the two threads edit in this thread op claims that several pokemon were going to be revealed at they werent yungoos pikipek or grubbin
pokemon,not_removed,rotom dex being the new hm slave sounds very believable after they added the eon flute in oras as a free fly although i have no idea how rotom an electric type will help with surf and dive
pokemon,not_removed,the champion is lillie who happens to be a reborn mew who died in the war years ago pfffthahahahahah damn that was a good one in all seriousness though that kind of a twist or backstory can only be applied to the pkmn mystery dungeon series it kinda sounds the same to our partner in smd too
pokemon,not_removed,all of these sound somewhat believable besides hau not being the main rival who else would be there when you get your first pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,you forgot about the rumor that hala is the alola region league champion and will play a major role in the story
pokemon,not_removed,type predictions popplio waterfighting litten fireground rowlet grassflying i tought type prediction was waterfighting grassground and pure fire
pokemon,not_removed,if the hm rumor were to be true that would be awesome it really sucks having to waste one of your six slots to have a hm slave
pokemon,not_removed,you might wanna add to your list
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure flygon will get a mega wasnt there a bit a while back where the mega evolution designer talked about him having writers block so he held off flygons mega design because he didnt want it to be lackluster
pokemon,not_removed,theres also the rumor that mega evolutions are gone and whatevers on the trainers bracelet is taking its place
pokemon,not_removed,i really want to know what nintendo meant by saying flowers were important
pokemon,not_removed,these leaks apparently are the real deal for the third evolution just today the second evolutions were also leaked with a colored picture coming soon heres a fake mid evolution one just for fun though
pokemon,not_removed,you could group the rumors dealing with zygarde xy and connecting past games into this game as gen rumors since thats what people mostly call them also nice list
pokemon,not_removed,im saying it now since its back the starter final typings will not be waterfighting grassground not fireground and pure fire as some people believe
pokemon,not_removed,popplio is not waterfairy what i thought the general assumption was the contrary zygarde complete has nothing to do with sun and moon lilly has zygarde cell in her bag hmm these two are contradictory maybe you should make two lists one consisting of things we think sun moon will have and one of things we believe they wont have to put the different points into perspective with each other i think that would be interesting edit the champion is lillie who happens to be a reborn mew who died in the war years ago no no really please dont tell me anyone believe these leaks
pokemon,not_removed,as a side note to this im betting zygarde is one of the four guardians
pokemon,not_removed,deleted
pokemon,not_removed,youll just ride your washing machine from island to island
pokemon,not_removed,that one was my own prediction that i added to the list i would really like to see that feature implemented into the games
pokemon,not_removed,rotom can possess electronic and mechanical devices maybe it will be able to temporarily leave the pokedex and possess other machines like an offboard motor to use surf or a chainsaw to use cut
pokemon,not_removed,that is a massive spoiler granted i already read it on a comment here two days ago but still
pokemon,not_removed,hau can be a secondary rival just like in previous gens and we would get introduced to someone else along the way i personally dont see hau becoming a champion he looks very laid back and relaxed and i like that about him i see hau more like the type of trainer that would go around the world exploring and having fun rather than training to be come the best and compete with you every step of the way i mean the guy does want to eat all the icecream in alola lol
pokemon,not_removed,where are people getting grass ground from they wouldnt change a starter mid line
pokemon,not_removed,its just there incase we do get moves most people on this sub agrees that there wont be a move but imagine if gf just pulls another dual type move thing on us the prediction list was made for us to look back and go remember that time when we thought gf would never put in moves
pokemon,not_removed,the champion is lillie who happens to be a reborn mew who died in the war years ago this sounds like whoever wrote that just finished psmd lol
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i know they kinda are but its things people have said in threads and what i picked up on i was trying to find references but right now i dont have the time to look up the exact quotes would like to find them and edit it in later edit changed the popplio thing
pokemon,not_removed,the real question is can we catch the champion
pokemon,not_removed,yeah thats why i was saying i dont see how that giant tree isnt connected to zygarde thats a world tree if i ever saw one
pokemon,not_removed,youll just ride your washing machine oh my
pokemon,not_removed,rnocontext
pokemon,not_removed,please let sumo have children running around with chainsaws lmao
pokemon,not_removed,but then again if you have a motor board or a chainsaw why would you need a pokemon to use it just use it without the pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,my first thought was the pokedex turning into a submarine
pokemon,not_removed,one important thing is also that hau has the weak starter instead of the stronger one also nice to see someone liking him instead of decrying him as yet another friendly rival plus i think a character like him does fit alolas hawaiian atmosphere pretty well
pokemon,not_removed,sans the fact that he has the starter weak to yours hau seems kind of similar to brendan and may generally friendly the first rival you meet in the games but as the story goes on you end up getting another rival that outshadows them one determined to become stronger than you
pokemon,not_removed,considering rowlet may be based on a burrowing owl id actually like to see this happen
pokemon,not_removed,its the order of icon in the japanese site ground is after flying and before fire they wouldnt change a starter mid line considerating our only example here is bulbasaur this claim cant be made
pokemon,not_removed,also because in the gameplay in the battle info screen it showed spaces for moves
pokemon,not_removed,or just have your rotom possess a waverunner and mini sub
pokemon,not_removed,because somethingsomething plotbased reasons
pokemon,not_removed,i live on an island and i totally understand hau its all about that chill sunny lifestyle and honestly one of my dreams is to travel the world and eat different types of food native to those places so me and hau are technically soul buddies lol
pokemon,not_removed,theres only one way id be fine with ground rowlet and it involves my flair
pokemon,not_removed,lol nice xd
pokemon,not_removed,wouldnt that basically be a moonkin from wow
pokemon,not_removed,thats me
pokemon,not_removed,thats me its chalk but also probably vandalism
pokemon,not_removed,the original artist comments with finished picture of the work so much hype this is gonna be best christmas
pokemon,not_removed,welp also found out that op works at the county clerks office
pokemon,not_removed,im not saying its fake but does it kinda look photoshopped to anybody else especially rowlet and what part of popplio is visible edit guys i see the other post now you can stop with the downvotes lol fuck you guys
pokemon,not_removed,dunno if you did this on purpose but you couldnt have taken the picture until after poplio wasnt covered
pokemon,not_removed,i stole your karma im sorry
pokemon,not_removed,wow that position looks uncomfortable good job
pokemon,not_removed,as a long time graffiti writer ive found wearing a reflective vest and hat makes you seem official enough to be left alone especially if youre writing with chalk and not uber permanent paint haha
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,damn creepy af you should be a detective
pokemon,not_removed,whats a jedi doing in kentucky
pokemon,not_removed,oa posted the finished version about an hour ago
pokemon,not_removed,little odd he would catch him when the drawing was basically entirely done its certainly possible but the chances are small
pokemon,not_removed,i had to get back to work do i didnt have time for him to finish it but theres the finished link by the artist
pokemon,not_removed,he posted the finished work about an hour ago
pokemon,not_removed,oh ok i just went by whats on the front of the building
pokemon,not_removed,i was also wondering this
pokemon,not_removed,yup ive seen it now
pokemon,not_removed,i will return hang on its right outside edit edit formatting
pokemon,not_removed,i already saw it and man was it incredible and i apologize for the accusation its just popplio gets a lot of flak so i didnt know if this was on purpose or not
pokemon,not_removed,give him the karma
pokemon,not_removed,i dont understand what that proved
pokemon,not_removed,the op said lyingly
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,woops messed up formating
pokemon,not_removed,rule of reddit op is always wrong
pokemon,not_removed,op is always wrong so truegivemeallthekarma
pokemon,not_removed,works for me
pokemon,not_removed,rule number the op lies
pokemon,not_removed,rule of op is a fagot
pokemon,not_removed,rule number if op isnt lying rule applies
pokemon,not_removed,is all
pokemon,not_removed,which sean country are you at
pokemon,not_removed,philippines
pokemon,not_removed,alolan smash
pokemon,not_removed,mrw someone leaves a box of frosted flakes in the kitchen and i look inside only to see that its empty
pokemon,not_removed,purusu urutura
pokemon,not_removed,this is what littens evolution really needs awesome fan art ive seen plenty of designs receive a mediocre reception at reveal but then the fan art starts rolling in and those of us sitting on the fence begin falling in love or as wed admit its starting to grow on me
pokemon,not_removed,made my evening
pokemon,not_removed,villain let me teach you the true meaning of pluuus ultraaaa
pokemon,not_removed,this is the best thing ive seen all day
pokemon,not_removed,this is the its also a tad bit nsfw
pokemon,not_removed,i cant believe no one has linked the video yet
pokemon,not_removed,i suddenly appear to like littens evolution
pokemon,not_removed,if the litten evo turns out to be fake this is gona be so funny
pokemon,not_removed,this comic has single handedly solidified my choice for getting litten
pokemon,not_removed,wow this fanart really makes me like littens evo now
pokemon,not_removed,such buff pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,thats so cool
pokemon,not_removed,this is sick
pokemon,not_removed,but i wanted to choose the owl why do you do this
pokemon,not_removed,i want that battle im gonna choose litten i want him and popplio but my friends are going to choose popplio so ill choose litten and get popplio from an egg and get sun so this battle could be posible
pokemon,not_removed,this comic pretty much convinced me that littens final evo could be pretty awesome after all
pokemon,not_removed,rko outta no where
pokemon,not_removed,damn i was gonna name my gumshoos all might but now im having second thoughts xd
pokemon,not_removed,awesome best starter plus best ub coming through
pokemon,not_removed,this little comic alone made me kinda want that final form
pokemon,not_removed,phenac smash
pokemon,not_removed,ok this comic may have just redeemed litten for me
pokemon,not_removed,i was expecting a spain reference disappointed
pokemon,not_removed,someone show me a scrawny version of littens final evolution plz
pokemon,not_removed,is blasting off again
pokemon,not_removed,and were blasting off again
pokemon,not_removed,what is plus ultra
pokemon,not_removed,dawn this zmove looks sick
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon and my hero academy my two favorite things mixed together
pokemon,not_removed,whats the source of this piece of art
pokemon,not_removed,bruh
pokemon,not_removed,so wait have they officially released the later forms i think i missed that
pokemon,not_removed,one punch
pokemon,not_removed,dangit i already convinced myself to change my starter from litten to rowlett since i didnt like the final evolution but this makes me doubt my decision i really love all might and i love this scene the most besides another scene but thats a bit spoilery
pokemon,not_removed,swolsquito is blasting off agaiiiiiiii
pokemon,not_removed,this is pretty awesome nice op
pokemon,not_removed,is it bad that when i hear plus ultra my mind goes straight to the coat of arms of spain
pokemon,not_removed,this made me like the pretty much confirmed final evo much more
pokemon,not_removed,so are the leaked evolutions confirmed at this point
pokemon,not_removed,all might s quirk is baton pass
pokemon,not_removed,i need to name my litten all might now
pokemon,not_removed,well if litten does turn out to be this im actually alright with it now thanks to this fanart ill be naming him all might for sure
pokemon,not_removed,okaythis made me like luchalitten even more damn it
pokemon,not_removed,i still hope they are fake which they like arent sadly we dont need humanoid starters i want some big awesome animals is this too much to ask for i just want to finally stop needing to box every starter since gen where this bad trend started they dont even feel like monsters they just feel like some guys in costumes
pokemon,not_removed,so we all assume that the leak is official now
pokemon,not_removed,i know how littens evolution is even more blatant fan service for furries its refreshing how a jacked beefy tiger humanoid isnt another fighting type rather a dark type of all the starter revolution leaks this is my favourite one
pokemon,not_removed,please dont be a fire wrestler cat be a badass cat version of houndoom please
pokemon,not_removed,is this a garfield fanfic
pokemon,not_removed,its super effective
pokemon,not_removed,unovan states of smash
pokemon,not_removed,this is strangely specific who hurt you
pokemon,not_removed,urutora
pokemon,not_removed,i know i wish more people would ignore the fighting type aspects of it since its supposed to be firedark and try to learn to appreciate how cool of a pokemon it actually is
pokemon,not_removed,i agree muscle cat litten has potental for great artwork
pokemon,not_removed,man this was so fucking hype seeing all might punching noomu out of the arena gives me shivers down my spine
pokemon,not_removed,hype af
pokemon,not_removed,that english dub ewww
pokemon,not_removed,join us
pokemon,not_removed,or this and this litten evolution being exclusive to different versions p
pokemon,not_removed,i think given the other details of the artwork it wouldnt be fake but rather it may be concept art that wasnt ultimately implemented as the final design
pokemon,not_removed,this ones by me these are from other people
pokemon,not_removed,make sure he learns fire punch
pokemon,not_removed,he was a wimp before mandatory fire starter bipedalism now hes a jerk and everybodyexcepttheffandom loves him
pokemon,not_removed,a boku no hero academia reference
pokemon,not_removed,they havent yet
pokemon,not_removed,do you have hulu or the internet
pokemon,not_removed,at least
pokemon,not_removed,it wont be official till we see the mid evos though if they have strong resemblances to the concepts then theyre official but ever since mallows reveal its getting harder and harder to call them fake lately but when you see and pay attention to the concepts they make sense being the final evos
pokemon,not_removed,please scolipede gets more attention from furries hes nothing but i like that they made him firedark too also you said revolution instead of evolution
pokemon,not_removed,that sounds a bit more unoriginal
pokemon,not_removed,ah but unova isnt the final region
pokemon,not_removed,obviously the person who left an empty box of frosted flakes in their kitchen
pokemon,not_removed,tony the tiger hurt me thats who
pokemon,not_removed,im assuming the joke is that they think littens evo looks like tony the tiger
pokemon,not_removed,ha i get it
pokemon,not_removed,ha ha ha wordplay
pokemon,not_removed,sure its supposed to be firedark but that doesnt change how it looks ill be honest if it wasnt for fire starter syndrome id fucking love the design but gens of firefighting and of humanoid fire starters has left me less than enthused with it that said this art is baller and fixes some of the weirder aspects of the design like the huge sausage fingers and almost nonexistent wrists
pokemon,not_removed,so much this im getting tired of all the littenhatred
pokemon,not_removed,i havent picked up fire pokemon since cindaquil but litten looks the best than a bottleg noctowl and the clown lion seal s in all seriousness the evolution is what pumped me up to pick litten really cool stuff
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know that was actually better than i expected shimura was the only one who really sounded awful
pokemon,not_removed,i actually really love the dub
pokemon,not_removed,thats the first time i watched the dub i liked some of their voice decisions but overall the delivery wasnt as powerful as the japanese one they toned it down a bit and made it more like the american hero which is ironic since that was the point of the anime anyway
pokemon,not_removed,i know its like they have to have shitty voice actors for all english dubs i mean its like they are all half asleep and reading off their lines with halfassed enthusiam compare it to the raw passion in this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyfbpbibhipw dub is just pathetic in comparison
pokemon,not_removed,as with most funimation dubs theyre pretty mediocre compared to the original edit i see opinions are not welcome here i wasnt saying people who like dubs are bad just that compared to the original it was mediocre jesus japanese voice actors are just better at the job they put more emotion and effort into it
pokemon,not_removed,he will do
pokemon,not_removed,what
pokemon,not_removed,i addition pretty much everything else from the same leak those images were from was proven to be true including the sea cucumber and football monkey i believe only the dolphin and snowman are missing from the chinese leak
pokemon,not_removed,scolipede how on earth
pokemon,not_removed,actually lucario and zoroark get more attention then a bug here like creature
pokemon,not_removed,thats the point why would i want another fire starter that is a fighter rather than a dark tiger fire beast
pokemon,not_removed,so while it does look like a firefighting starter the fact that its dark type plus its wrestler design immediately turns me on the whole thing because its so obvious a heel if youre not familiar a heel in professional wrestling is someone who is supposed to be a bad guy someone for the face good guy to do battle with someone for the crowd to boo although often actually cheered for and to do dirty tricks and call in secret tag teams to take down the hero which its dark typing works perfectly with as a face would most definitely be a fighting type weak to the heels dark attacks the design is actually brilliant edit dark is weak to fighting not the other way around so the faces honorable strikes would be strong against the heels dirty tactics in gfs minds my bad
pokemon,not_removed,this is why you box your starter if you dont like them in a gen fennekin went straight into my pc and only came out to help ditto earn me the rest of my starters
pokemon,not_removed,its well deserved they show us a starter pokemon with huge potential to be creative they couldve done a firedark or fireground sabertooth tiger with likeable elements and then we get humanoid firefighting tony the tiger reject look at the fangs and the tail it looks just like emboar its so sad the other two evolutions are not better i would cancle my preorder and never play the games to make these evolutions be fake but they seem to be real ill deny these till the end though these must be fake
pokemon,not_removed,same guy who voiced alex armstrong as all might whats not to love
pokemon,not_removed,hey now some dubs are perfectly fine ya bunch of voice acting snobs
pokemon,not_removed,my hero academia
pokemon,not_removed,yep now we play the waiting game
pokemon,not_removed,i honestly dont know
pokemon,not_removed,it looks like a horse its bedroom eyes its hot red and purple exterior i dont know it looks like a bug pony not a furry fyi
pokemon,not_removed,accept this one is supposed to be firedark
pokemon,not_removed,as a face would most definitely be a fighting type weak to the heels dark attacks wat
pokemon,not_removed,so while it does look like a firefighting starter the fact that its dark type plus its wrestler design immediately turns me on the whole thing because its so obvious a heel did i miss something saying littens final evo is definitely a firedark
pokemon,not_removed,i wasnt familiar until everyone and their mom started using that as an excuse for a firefighting design dont get me wrong it might have been cool if they had done it with emboar but honestly i dont care about wrestling so the concept does nothing for me
pokemon,not_removed,i think that the design is brilliant especially for a heel pokemon but i dont think it necessarily belonged with litten to be honest if they made him a separate pure dark type it would be awesome maybe they could have even made a dayform face with a fighting type i think it was confirmed once in an interview that the fighting type was meant to be good and dark types being bad
pokemon,not_removed,i actually lucked out and got a female fenniken first pick so i named it elaine and used it but i got more milage out of the free torchic
pokemon,not_removed,to be the slightest bit fair theyre also probably going to end up with a quadrupedal darkelement big cat in alolan persian this gen so they might not have wanted to double up on the visual design there
pokemon,not_removed,but whats creative about sabertooth tigers if i look at all those fanarts they usually look like reject dnd monsters at worst and red saberleomon clones at best additionally it wouldnt fit littens personality as well as a heel wrestler does usidewaysinfinity sums his design concept up pretty well its well thought out and accurately depicted something i cant honestly say about some of the previous fire starters its undeservingly hated because it isnt what the mainstream wished for very much like emboar and whats wrong with rowletts final evolution i would never have guessed an archer and they pretty much nailed the design seriously im beginning to think postinfernape fire starters get shit on for the sole purpose of trashtalking them at least none of the new starters is as bland as typhlosion
pokemon,not_removed,littens evo is a firedark heel wrestler which makes sense because they often decorate their outfits in blackred with spikes and flames and littens bad attitude and greasiness play into that and i like all of them except popplios so pretty sure this is a matter of opinion its looking like theyll be getting split sunmoon evos like rockruff anyway though so just get sun and quit complaining
pokemon,not_removed,exactly his manly voice has been gracing animation for generations
pokemon,not_removed,i actually thought the english dub was damn good i think people have way too high expectations when it comes to english dubs of anime shows
pokemon,not_removed,but muh superior nihon seiyūs
pokemon,not_removed,wow youre right i totally derped on that one dark type is honestly the type i forget its weaknesses and strengths to the most along with poison my analogy still works in reverse then but yeah i shoulda looked that up before i posted
pokemon,not_removed,its not confirmed im just going with what ive heard and what its design implies i get a very houndoom edgy feel from littens final evo
pokemon,not_removed,translated description on the concept say that it likes too cheat and fight dirty along with its menacing demeanor all these match up with a dark type pokemon so firedark
pokemon,not_removed,im not making excuses for gf and their designs im just recognizing a good idea and design while also noting the foolishness of it due to the whole firefighting fatigue that has grown due to their carelessness with the starters also you dont have to like wrestling to recognize a cool looking or at least wellthought out design
pokemon,not_removed,it still kind of works with litten however because heels often dress very edgy with spikes flames lightning or metal and the litten final evo definitely has that slightly edgy feel that really carries the design intent just that bit further unfortunately the firefighting baggage is there so i totally understand the fatigue and general complaints
pokemon,not_removed,but gens of firefighting and of humanoid fire starters has left me less than enthused with it
pokemon,not_removed,at least none of the new starters is as bland as typhlosion hey how dare you sometimes simplicity is best he may not be edgy as fuck with the sickest design youve ever seen but hes still pretty fucking tight edit i agree with most of your points you made except that unnecessary typhlosion bashing
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon designs dont exist in a vacuum and because of that id say not creative because of previous gens at least to me if youre saying being a heel makes it creative then any of the sabertooth designs could be creative if the designers gave it lore too like the fireground one give it stalactite fangs and its stripes are channels of active lava that flow out many islanders revere them as beings of creation as during mating season the gather to create a new island by spewing forth lava they mate on these islands and spend the first year of their cubs life on it raising them before moving back into the dense jungle these islands are important to the aloan natives as the soil is extremely fertile and provides space for the rapidly expanding population rough as shit but im not a professional and its off the top of my head
pokemon,not_removed,i was fine with the dub except for tsuyu and minetas voices
pokemon,not_removed,hmmm that does sound like more firedark than firefighting although still wouldnt call it a fact
pokemon,not_removed,yeah it started the trend so it deserves some of the blame but blaziken is my favorite pokemon it was the last starter i picked when my cousins played with me its also why hoenn is my favorite region but yeah i used my favorite pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,creativity has become a meaningless buzzword in this community if you dont like a design thats on you the pokemon you describe would have nothing left of littens trait of producing oil you know who oils themselves up a lot wrestlers discrediting the value of a pokemon because similar things have been done in previous installements of the franchise is condescending at best and stupid at worst especially with a constantly changing design team we just got a quadropedal fire cat one generation ago so according to your logic and the fact that there barely are any fully evolved bipedal felines would make a bipedal one more of a distinction surely pokemon dont exist in a vacuum but starter pokemon were never tuned to the regions they were released in thats why they usually dont appear in the wild they most likely arent natives additionally your mythology sounds more fitting for a legendary or at least semilegendary pokemon why are people so stuckup with fourlegged fire starters anyhow there never has been one even typhlosion stands on just legs bipedal pokemon inspired by the chinese zodiac pretty much is the whole design concept of fire starters
pokemon,not_removed,tsuyu would be kinda hard to do in the first place so i dont mind it at all honestly i cant imagine too many people trying to nail that raspy frog voice as well as the actress they got to do her
pokemon,not_removed,haha fair enough
pokemon,not_removed,of course my not liking the design is on me body builders and people going tanning also oil themselves up but theyd also be unimpressive to me you make good points on the lore being more fit for a legendary or psuedos and the fact about starters are basically imported do we have any fully evolved bipedal cats other than litten were stuck up on it because theres never been one and a tiger would be the perfect time to try overall though i admit im letting the design bother me more than it should but tigers are my favorite animal and fire is my favorite type so when the fire starter looked like it could be a badass fire tiger and we got an edgy meowchoman randy savage i was bummed of course im not the end all be all of taste so these are just my opinion
pokemon,not_removed,a fire typed tiger sounds like some fakemon a year old would make im glad we got a badass creative monster heel wrestling cat thing it looks like something different and unexpected something creative that pokemon would make not some generic looking thing that looks like it could be from one of those rip off pokemon games with the fanmade starters you see in facebook ads
pokemon,not_removed,i fail to see how an animal with a certain type is automatically a fakemon but your entire argument can also be applied to typhlosion as its just a fire type bear badger if you like luchalitten thats cool as i said previously my dislike is an opinion and thus isnt inherently right or wrong however a big bipedal fighter looking fire starter is far from different and unexpected at this point
pokemon,not_removed,litten looks even more jaded than usual oo
pokemon,not_removed,was bounsweets sprite based on jumpluffs its so cute
pokemon,not_removed,i think that you could be a bit more creative with whitespace some of these look very dense compared to the old gb sprites litten and chargabug immediately spring to mind just a thought
pokemon,not_removed,id love to see the alola forms next sandshrew vulpix raichu exeggutor meowth and marowak all need this treatment
pokemon,not_removed,hey i remember seeing your sprites a few months ago do you mind if i use a couple of these for perler patterns ill make sure to give you credit httpswwwinstagramcompbhasrejlcda
pokemon,not_removed,ah i love these and i saw the prototype alolan exeggutor you linked in the comments that ones probably my favorite actually i think part of the charm of old sprites is just how downright wonky they looked sometimes from hitmonchan with one massive fist to a fat blastoise and an oddly underdeveloped mew theres something about limited power in a gameboy that gives the crazy sprites a lotta character itd be funny to see something like a grubbin sprite with mandibles that are just a bit too big or something like that i can tell something sort of reminiscent of this is present with rowlets sprite showing off how he can turn his head while retaining his overall body shape these are all great by the way id love to see if you can get around to the rest of the new alolan pokémon at some point the new mons like turtonator and stufful are just begging for some ohsoslightly out of place sprite work c
pokemon,not_removed,this post puts all of the new pokemon haters that say things like these new pokemon dont even look like pokemon in the dirt
pokemon,not_removed,litten sprite reminds me a bit of garfield and i love it
pokemon,not_removed,ah green meatloaf my favorite pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,here are some tips use color palettes actually used on the gameboy dont use too much dithering a lot of sprites were poorly made with inconsistent sizes of body parts use more white most pokemon sprites were white with the light and dark shades of color used for shading rarely for coloring its more like you got to make sure it looks good in black and white and light grey and dark grey and then pick the overall color of the pokemon and find a pokemon with that color palette keep in mind theres no bright redblue colors only in yellow where almost every sprite is shaded with bright red and bright yellow which looks really awful in my opinion the sprites often looked pale httpimgurcomaynfjn im sure youll get the hang of it
pokemon,not_removed,thanks these are so cool i love poplio and his sprite is so great plz keep making these
pokemon,not_removed,i love these gen sprites dont get enough love
pokemon,not_removed,fantastic the popplio sprite looks like its straight out of gen ii the chargabug sprite doesnt really work though if i hadnt seen the art model for it id have no idea what i was looking at do the sprites follow actual gbc restrictions
pokemon,not_removed,would you mind if i made some of these with my perler beads id only really upload them to my deviantart and id credit the heck out of you
pokemon,not_removed,the raddish thing whatever its called has no eyes
pokemon,not_removed,these are great i love mimikyus d
pokemon,not_removed,can we get these as flairs
pokemon,not_removed,crabbrawler
pokemon,not_removed,this is so coooool
pokemon,not_removed,whats that in the bottom right
pokemon,not_removed,if they were faithful gb sprites then you wouldnt be able to tell what they are s
pokemon,not_removed,so anyone figure out whether that cheap pikachus face is on his head or his stomach
pokemon,not_removed,these look great id like to make an animal crossing new leaf shirt with these sprites on them
pokemon,not_removed,i love poplio
pokemon,not_removed,i know im late to the party but screw it this is the best fanmade popplio i have ever seen and i love it and you for making it
pokemon,not_removed,why
pokemon,not_removed,litten looks like saitama and i love it
pokemon,not_removed,the colors look off like i dont think that thats how they would look colorwise except for maybe flameow or whatever his name is
pokemon,not_removed,it knows what evolution is coming
pokemon,not_removed,even more of a reason to draft er chose it as a starter
pokemon,not_removed,indeed but its his mo
pokemon,not_removed,it actually reminded me more of hoppip but i do see the resemblance
pokemon,not_removed,your flair text describes what i was thinking when looking at this post
pokemon,not_removed,what specifically do you mean by whitespace
pokemon,not_removed,ive been trying exeggutor its a struggle its hard to emulate the style when the sprite either needs to be massive or have an awkward perspective though i do have a sitting in the corner of the file
pokemon,not_removed,hey man or girl whatever im looking to get into perling sprites but i cant find a crystal sprite version of all pkmn but more so importantly a sprites of the gen any help
pokemon,not_removed,go right ahead
pokemon,not_removed,link to the previous perler patterns
pokemon,not_removed,i think the new pokémon dont look like pokémon argument is invalid i feel like every regions pokémon are all unique like they all have this different type of feel to them where you can tell what region a pokémons from
pokemon,not_removed,to be honest im one of those people the pokemon designs of gens are what turned me off of the series these last few years no hate towards those who like them though that said i think a lot of the designs in the upcoming generation are a return to form
pokemon,not_removed,i appreciate the criticism i was never exactly clear how the colors worked so i assumed i could just use the dropper tool on the palette i downloaded i will try my best to be more faithful to the style in the future and of course i will recolor the ones already completed
pokemon,not_removed,wow that second link is fantastic
pokemon,not_removed,absolutely go ahead
pokemon,not_removed,pupils it definitely doesnt have pupils in the first place
pokemon,not_removed,i aim to do every alola pokemon im starting with the smaller ones for now though
pokemon,not_removed,mimikyu
pokemon,not_removed,true
pokemon,not_removed,the eyes on his stomach are his real eyes
pokemon,not_removed,cool beans
pokemon,not_removed,ok
pokemon,not_removed,i think he means that the sprites used to have blank white spaces where the light was supposed to be oh by the way i like your sprites a lot
pokemon,not_removed,are the sprites from crystal which kinda explain what i mean most if not all of them have some creative whitespace use that makes them look most alive and less like blobs of color do you kinda see what i mean sorry if i sound pedantic its just something that i noticed
pokemon,not_removed,it looks awful and therefore perfect jk yours is definitely high quality and has the scariness that a lot of the old ones did
pokemon,not_removed,for a prototype thats damn good i absolutely love it
pokemon,not_removed,the face needs to be more terrifying really great work dude
pokemon,not_removed,that looks really good actually
pokemon,not_removed,httppokemondbnetsprites
pokemon,not_removed,gen is actually what brought me back i love so many of those pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,i believe the gen sprites were from the japenese redgreen but jinx is from yellow look at the color palette and i dont remember if the ditto sprite is the one from japanese redgreen
pokemon,not_removed,no i mean like it doesnt have eyes
pokemon,not_removed,i really wanted an alolan crawdaunt but crabrawler is the next best thing
pokemon,not_removed,i see so its like the fucked up cousin of ditto born of incest so it cant shape shift and it draws on sheets instead
pokemon,not_removed,ahh okay xdd
pokemon,not_removed,i see what you mean for litten its quite dark so whiteonblack dithering didnt seem appropriate for charjabug there is a little bit of light on its corner though i can try right now to dither it slightly better edit
pokemon,not_removed,i do know what you mean thats called dithering when you use two colors to create the illusion of something inbetween i explained my choices in a reply to one of the other commenters if youre interested why
pokemon,not_removed,is there a better word for that than whitespace because to me that means he negative area around the actual mon op said dithering but i think thats a general term for a checkerboard between two pixel colors not necessarily the effect youre talking about or maybe it is and im just horribly wrong as usual
pokemon,not_removed,i think what you are looking for are the highlights that were used to give the illusion of volumes to the sprites the reason why they were all always white is due to the limited memory of the handleds
pokemon,not_removed,eehhhhh see ive already exhausted the sidebar on beadsprites and have the first gens but im wanting them all as gen sprites and the gen as and gen sprites as well but thank you really close but no cigar
pokemon,not_removed,thats cool i was only speaking of my preference lots of people loved gen
pokemon,not_removed,thats one way to put it
pokemon,not_removed,from serebiis current page on gen pokes mimikyu lives its life completely covered by its cloth and is always hidden people believe that anybody who sees its true form beneath the cloth will be stricken with a mysterious illness people in the alola region are convinced that you must never try to peek beneath its covering mimikyus health fails when its bathed in the rays of the sun so it prefers to stick to dark places its rumored that the reason it covers itself with a cloth is to avoid sunlight the rising popularity of pikachustyled merchandise around years ago is the reason that mimikyu makes itself look like pikachu in fact this pokémon is dreadfully lonely and it thought it would be able to make friends with humans if only it looked like pikachu
pokemon,not_removed,gotcha the updated chargabug sprite definitely has more life in it i understand the struggle with litten since its so dark these do look great btw
pokemon,not_removed,you can still update littens to make it look better the gbc sprites all used two colours red and white so for litten you still have another colour to use for whitespace id say do the same with how umbreon was and use a grey as a substitute for white edit never mind i forgot about the yellow eyes
pokemon,not_removed,dithering is indeed a technique used for color transitions in pixel art while it can be used to create an illusion of volume or relief that would fall under the domain of highlights the whitespace and cast shadows
pokemon,not_removed,is what youre looking for someone else posted it in here i hope it helps
pokemon,not_removed,oh i should have noted that gen is what made me fall off haha well that and being a teenager
pokemon,not_removed,but for all pkmn
pokemon,not_removed,water beam
pokemon,not_removed,i know that feeling i get my own characters wrong sometimes if im not looking at a reference
pokemon,not_removed,i dont get what the difference is
pokemon,not_removed,i think it looks nice
pokemon,not_removed,i made this for a school assignment move name accuracy wasnt really a top priority when my teacher only knows the gist of pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,but how much more effort is it to put water gun anyone with the newest iphone could understand that
pokemon,not_removed,knowing how crown of thorns starfish are in real life and the pokedex entry i think merciless is quite fitting
pokemon,not_removed,yeah im pretty inclined to agree im still not sure if toxapex would be inclined to run corrosion over regenerator since regenerators just so damn good on it but salazzle would definitely appreciate merciless run her alongside a toxic spiker and she could do some major damage
pokemon,not_removed,merciless would make it absolutely bonkers
pokemon,not_removed,if salazzle had merciless with its spa and speed it would be broken as fuck
pokemon,not_removed,if you spend one turn using toxic and two turns attacking youll deal an equal amount of damage as if you had just spent turns attacking assuming your opponent doesnt switch your special attack is so high that very few pokemon will survive long enough for merciless to help
pokemon,not_removed,nice which colored pencils did you use
pokemon,not_removed,i love your lotad congrats on persevering this far
pokemon,not_removed,you improved a lot keep it up this is inspiring for all artists that struggle with pushing forward
pokemon,not_removed,whats up with lombre and his massive underbite haha
pokemon,not_removed,looks great but you should look into maybe getting some prisma colors
pokemon,not_removed,i have a set of the blick brand one and a few prismacolors i cant draw worth squat but i can color like a madman lol although i got a set of graphite pencils to so i might attempt to draw at some point but i am bad with shapes lol
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure its supposed to be a beak but its funny as hell i love it would you mind if i made a digital version of it and posted it but gave you credit haha
pokemon,not_removed,ehhh yes and no it really depends on my mood right now im working on one from animal world michaels exclusive or some such it was on sale for that is pretty complicated but there are days where the simpler the better lol although i did sketch last night and its my first ever attempt at a pokemon ended up following a tutorial for mimikyu
pokemon,not_removed,its actually kinda fun and coming from me fairly simple i still need to work on it but i think its not bad for a first attempt lol
pokemon,not_removed,i swear there was someone posting the first one on the left a few days ago claiming he took years to finish
pokemon,not_removed,about a year per generation she would work off and on
pokemon,not_removed,is this some kind of sick joke how is this even possible these are amazing
pokemon,not_removed,i feel so not talented
pokemon,not_removed,i like the johto one the best the celebi in the middle is pretty sweet
pokemon,not_removed,how long did it take her to make
pokemon,not_removed,i will pay lots of money lol
pokemon,not_removed,poor bulbasaur
pokemon,not_removed,this is amazing she caught them all
pokemon,not_removed,funny how i have a favorite different type starter each game venusaur feraligatr and blaziken
pokemon,not_removed,incredible work
pokemon,not_removed,wailord is just too big the fact hes not a better pokemon is criminal
pokemon,not_removed,i like when the owner of the oc post after the liar
pokemon,not_removed,thats god tier work
pokemon,not_removed,ahhh gen sprites are so nice looking also this looks amazing and i want one pleased
pokemon,not_removed,she is loving all your comments thanks everyone its motivated her to get going on gen iv
pokemon,not_removed,deleted
pokemon,not_removed,wow i wish i could do that
pokemon,not_removed,where did she get the pattern for these at
pokemon,not_removed,this is absolutely amazing i have only started the first generation ive had to put it away though as i am going back to school please keep posting these i would love to see them all completed
pokemon,not_removed,this is cool but espeon is the wrong colour
pokemon,not_removed,this is amazing she caught them all
pokemon,not_removed,how much for gen 😁😁😁😁
pokemon,not_removed,didnt someone post number claiming it took them years
pokemon,not_removed,years people have been making them for a long time just guessing op saw the post the other day and wanted to show what his wife had made
pokemon,not_removed,its different that one was wider and had gravelers arms in the stitch this doesnt
pokemon,not_removed,yeah and graveler is still in the wrong spot what the fuck
pokemon,not_removed,she spent around a year on each she worked off and on she loves doing it
pokemon,not_removed,its different that one was wider and had gravelers arms in the stitch this doesnt
pokemon,not_removed,the other guy extended his because he wanted the full pokemon sprite in it this guys wife is following the patterns exactly so theyre a all the same size
pokemon,not_removed,this is all generations this is the extended generation i wish there was some for all of them
pokemon,not_removed,yes we hope to get them framed and hang them in our family room same size is key
pokemon,not_removed,i thought it would be cool to have it have like a chili pepper on its back or something then add a fire to its grass type
pokemon,not_removed,are you planning on a romhack with these
pokemon,not_removed,did the cave had lava or something
pokemon,not_removed,wel theyre turning out pretty good and i would give advice if i had any to give lol
pokemon,not_removed,maybe a shrimp type clawitzer variant
pokemon,not_removed,so an extra spicy bulbasaur sounds good
pokemon,not_removed,whatever gym the water gym is crawdaunt has to be the top pokemon in that one make the gym leader a highend chef who loved boiling and frying in hisher backyard with water pokemon as a kid ironically with the corphish heshe caught in their ditches
pokemon,not_removed,maybe im out of the loop but ive seen i think posts that have cajon in the title so wondering what cajon is besides a play on words from cajun which is what i originally thought it was supposed to be
pokemon,not_removed,thank you i am taking any ideas i can get i am still learning how to do sprites though xd
pokemon,not_removed,i do not know yet
pokemon,not_removed,yes but i reached the word limit on the title so i couldnt include it dx
pokemon,not_removed,cajon is the regional variants of pokemon in the cajo region a region me and my friend are working on it is a region based on louisiana i been working on this since september or october i feel louisiana deserves to be a region in the pokemon games our culture is one of the best in the world also it can give way to many great things
pokemon,not_removed,id love to see it evolve to have a volcano on its back instead of a flower keep up the great work
pokemon,not_removed,so basically they burning bulbasaurs
pokemon,not_removed,ayyy a fellow cajun it is true we have the best culture in america
pokemon,not_removed,maybe they just want to get high p
pokemon,not_removed,tutorial
pokemon,not_removed,httpbulbapediabulbagardennetwikistatsjudge also you should ask questions like this in the weekly thread
pokemon,not_removed,thank you all
pokemon,not_removed,and pokeemon is a bell sprout so that means sex is a sprout xd what a funny
pokemon,not_removed,mareep is a great pokemon to have that you can get fairly early on gold and silver were some of my favorites with the twists on some of the original as well good luck
pokemon,not_removed,have fun dont get frustrated if youre stuck thatll turn you away from it heartgold is a big game and one of the hardest just look up a walk through or guide httpwwwserebiinetheartgoldsoulsilvergiftshtml
pokemon,not_removed,grab a pokémon with fighting type moves for whitneys gym she can be a pain otherwise
pokemon,not_removed,so hg and ss are remakes of gold and silver and i think theyre pretty fucking awesome i never played the originals so idk how theyre different but im playing ss right now and im really happy also you should be totally psyched that you got it free cuz even tho its old and you get used copies its still priced like new if youve never played any pokemon game then what i would tell you is to battle everyone you see and try to avoid running away from wild battles a lot of players will come to gyms including younger me way underlevelled and lose to the gym leader a bunch then you have to go out and grind meaning battle loads of wilds to get exp and level enough to win and that part can fucking suck but when you finally beat the gym leader it feels awesome so dont quit just cuz you have to spend minutes being bored also idk if you know but and if you do im sorry you can teach your pokemon moves using items that you get called technical machines or hidden machines tms can only be used once but can be taught over hms are used outside of battle and during but cant be unlearned without the move deleter who is free but you dont get to until the last city before elite four so be careful which pokemon you teach which hms cuz youre pretty stuck with them and some are good and others not so much as far as team construction goes i like to go sort of balanced on typing but you can do whatever you want but definitely pay attention to what types of pokemon you have and what types your opponents use so that you dont find yourself fighting uphill battles typewise for example trying to beat a fire type with a grass type will be pointlessly frustrating especially if you have a strong type like water or ground in your party you can figure this out on your own but the internet is a great resource for this just note that the typing matches have changed as new types are added so make sure youre looking at the right info if you havent picked a starter i personally think cyndaquil is the easiest to play through but the other two are just fine i picked chikorita this time and had a little bit of an uphill battle because gyms and are types that are strong to grass but you do what you want hg and ss are different than the other games excluding gold and silver in that when you beat the elite four and champion youre not done you then go and play all of the kanto gyms after doing all the jhoto ones and battle them again so thats pretty great but it means that from start to total finish its longer than any other region battle a lot pick stuff you like to use talk to people a lot giggle at some of the humour have fun
pokemon,not_removed,youre welcome good luck
pokemon,not_removed,thank you im excited ill be on the lookout for one
pokemon,not_removed,i try to problem solve and brainstorm without a guide but with it being a big game ill remember that thank you
pokemon,not_removed,fighting isnt my favorite type but ill keep that in mind what should i expect from her
pokemon,not_removed,holy shit thats a big message thank you though all of that helped i think im ok with my totodile as a starter its always a hard choice though as far as my personality goes again thank you so much for the tips im looking forward to the long play through
pokemon,not_removed,miltank of doom seriously though if it starts using rollout itll be hard to keep going
pokemon,not_removed,damn alright thanks for the heads up
pokemon,not_removed,no problem have fun on your adventure
pokemon,not_removed,throw in a beedrill just for shits and giggles i mean a beedrill that could level the alone level
pokemon,not_removed,use pichu and dont evolve him
pokemon,not_removed,do a randomizer nuzlocke
pokemon,not_removed,i had a team planned for my next firered rom hack playthrough so ill share it with you fearrow magmar apparently you can get all pokemon up to third gen tangela lapras jolteon primeapeone of the hitmons
pokemon,not_removed,im assuming your a game grumps fan as well
pokemon,not_removed,bundt is my hero
pokemon,not_removed,and they just walked through lorelei
pokemon,not_removed,nope mostly cause of colosseum
pokemon,not_removed,no
pokemon,not_removed,bald wartortle is really offputting
pokemon,not_removed,i cant wait to see what you do with geodude a rock with no arms and no face
pokemon,not_removed,you could make spot the differences books from these
pokemon,not_removed,i like how you only slightly changed the color of venusaur hes already almost perfect
pokemon,not_removed,yep you fixed charmeleon i support you
pokemon,not_removed,i feel like he should have blastoisestyle ears
pokemon,not_removed,i bet seel is gonna look out of this world
pokemon,not_removed,ah so youre taking pokémon and making them worse
pokemon,not_removed,symbiosis the plant provides nutrients via photosynthesis that supplements a bulbasaurs diet allowing it to either not eat as much or go extended periods without needing food in turn the bulbasuar moves around spreading seeds or just general safety
pokemon,not_removed,theres algae growing in the backs of certain salamanders that provides nutrients
pokemon,not_removed,according to httpswwwquoracomhowwouldarealbulbasaurwork bulbasaur has reallife equivalents
pokemon,not_removed,still a plant
pokemon,not_removed,theres different colored poké beans each color caps at x
pokemon,not_removed,must have bean horrible knowing that the beans vanish into hyperspace im not sorry
pokemon,not_removed,also once you get to about it stops letting you exchange patterned beans for regular
pokemon,not_removed,what will i use them for
pokemon,not_removed,huh thats interesting definitely makes sense so do you know if you reach in red beans at say would every subsequent red bean you try and pick up just vanish per se
pokemon,not_removed,i immediately realized and had just recently saved so i just soft reset and used up a decent amount on abeens aplenny and aphun before collecting them again edit i just saw the bean pun
pokemon,not_removed,i noticed this as well but didnt mind converting patterned beans doesnt matter once youve upgraded your entire poke pelago imo
pokemon,not_removed,like any beans just use them on your pokemon for affection or just grow a random abundance of berries can never have enough of status healers and leppas and ev reducing berries keep using the aphun isle to look for gold bottle caps or evo stones or for sellable items every hours or just stick plain beans in isle abeens if youre getting close to the cap youll get those back the next day honestly there really isnt a reason to not use plain beans i just never thought to use more than enough for hours
pokemon,not_removed,rainbows only ever get used to raise affection in new mons i use the plain and patterned beans in a to ratio for the other isles i also feed excess beans so that i can get rare candies from the cafe guy
pokemon,not_removed,feeding beans to your pokemon and then talking to the cafe owner at any pokemon center can net you a rare candy but i dont know how many beans you have to feed them at a time
pokemon,not_removed,i wouldnt doubt it
pokemon,not_removed,oh peas i even put it in italics
pokemon,not_removed,plain and patterned will give you hours i use this in isle abeens to try to make sure wanderers dont leave while i wait to add them to my party
pokemon,not_removed,ill see if theres someway i can test this in the coming days if im at there has to be at least thats hit so ill try only picking just one color and seeing if each color can get me to if they can i dont think theres a cap of on each individual bean color i think this might be the best way of testing this out well see i guess this isnt a huge deal by any means but ill do it just for the sake of doing it hah
pokemon,not_removed,i just make it twelve hours because thats how long it takes for isle aphun takes for an excavation also i dont think isle abeens makes pokemon stay i think it just attracts more pokemon and more frequently
pokemon,not_removed,you can check in pokémon refresh
pokemon,not_removed,no shit well ive havent checked pokemon refresh since going for sylveon haha cool thanks for the info so i had purple plain beans capped at saw that i had purple beans in my pokepelago and grabbed only them my total plain bean count went up still i went to refresh and saw that the beans just distributed themselves among the rest of the colors starting with the lowest plain color count first so thats cool you dont have to worry about certain colors capping out you just have to worry about the total count reaching
pokemon,not_removed,that magikarps splash is a ohko move
pokemon,not_removed,what field is this
pokemon,not_removed,somebody should pinch run that magikarp theres no way itll be able to steal third if it keeps such a small lead at second not to mention magikarp is known to be a pretty bad baserunner what is the manager thinking
pokemon,not_removed,i dread to be the person in the way of its evolution
pokemon,not_removed,omg i was at that park too soooo many magikarps lol plus the pitchers mound was the gym and all the poke stops were lured it was awesome good game too
pokemon,not_removed,att park
pokemon,not_removed,if only it was raining it could run those bases twice as fast
pokemon,not_removed,looks beautiful had my first experience with a major park at the rogers centre last night but as its a retractable dome things feel much more enclosed i prefer the open air
pokemon,not_removed,at least we won
pokemon,not_removed,no
pokemon,not_removed,lunala looks too similar to shiny yveltal
pokemon,not_removed,why not make solgaleo black
pokemon,not_removed,i like these a lot but if there are intentional alchemy references im betting solgaleo will be greenunfortunately
pokemon,not_removed,what shiny solgaleo be that disgusting lime green specially since the simbol people say it represents is originally green
pokemon,not_removed,wont matter anyway theyll be shiny locked until like gen
pokemon,not_removed,i would love to see a black sunblack lion better than white anyway
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt even know that was on android i heard of a jukebox and thought i heard it was ios only wow
pokemon,not_removed,dang only a few days ago i took notice of the jukebox on my android after not opening it for months still havent opened it just saw the icon shame that they wont keep up with the free song rotations after the first time to uninstall i suppose
pokemon,not_removed,you need a certain level of ocd i have now diamond y and as
pokemon,not_removed,i like to make a list so i can score them off as i go i find it oddly satisfying
pokemon,not_removed,wat
pokemon,not_removed,are you putting it to sleep cant waste pp is its sleeping
pokemon,not_removed,i reset sogaleo to get a jolly one
pokemon,not_removed,same here but didnt save before so i guess im screwed
pokemon,not_removed,the struggle is real man
pokemon,not_removed,its also much easier to catch
pokemon,not_removed,thing is i didnt expect this to be too difficult since i caught the other tapus without hassle enough for them to be caught on the first encounter but this this one is such a pain ill prolly throw yawn or something on my mimikyu or get a random pokemon with a move to put it to sleep thanks for the advice
pokemon,not_removed,just beat the again
pokemon,not_removed,sounds like fun ive just been breeding since i finished the elite so i havent even caught any of the ultra beasts or guardian deities ill see how that goes when i get to them
pokemon,not_removed,thanks i didnt know that worked for fini too i thought it was only tapu koko
pokemon,not_removed,if you have xy and oras you can get everything but the mythicals
pokemon,not_removed,before pokebank was released gamefreak made it so that every pokemon was available to appease the fanbase so you can catch everything if you have a version of xy and oras however not all forms are available like the summer autumn and winter forms of deerling and sawsbuck without trading from a gen v game
pokemon,not_removed,well technically mew is catchable in the first generation games you have to use a glitch though while in gen you have to rely on events which are already over other than that though everything that isnt from an event should be catchable somewhere in gen games or received as a gift in a few cases or breed in the case of certain baby pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think its possible to have flying or surfing pikachu in gen because to trade the pikachu up you have to delete its hms maybe you could reteach it at the move tutor also notch eared pichu fused kyurem and cosplay pikachu are stuck in their respective games
pokemon,not_removed,im not sure if oras changed this but as of xy glameow could only be found in pearl something i had to learn the hard way while using pokémon bank for a living dex bugout
pokemon,not_removed,so im too lazy to crosscheck what is obtainable easier or at all in xy but speaking for oras here as a lot of people say between oras and xy you can catch literally everything except event distributions oras even demoted deoxys from event status the catch is that a lot of things added to oras are only available through postgroudonkyogre dexnav or mirage spots which are slightly tedious and slightly hinging on your luck with random islands respectively dexnav is for a brief explanation relevant to these pokemon a way of tracking hidden pokemon on a route that otherwise dont appear in random wild battles each normal routelocation will have nonhoenn native hidden pokemon the following is all dexnav pokemon sorted by generation but not sorted in any kind of order within it ponyta clefairy eevee rattata raticate hypno growlithe paras onix diglett mankey kakuna pidgeotto seel dewgong misdreavus aipom delibird chatot gible skorupi luxio finneon buneary bronzor zorua sewaddle tympole gothita pidove frillish garbodor sandile dwebble sawk throh scraggy bouffalant joltik deerling elgyem alolamola cottonee timburr axew roggenrola druddigon deino cubchoo phantump skrelp clauncher mirage location pokemon again by gen but in dex order this time persian slowpoke tangela ditto porygon unown forretress stantler elekid magby cherrim glameow purugly happiny zebstrika excadrill audino petilil darmanitan maractus cofagrius minccino klink tynamo vullaby larvesta onix graveler vulpix xatu donphan girafarig boldore crustle and rufflet can also be obtained from mirage but are also obtainable elsewhere so theyre omitted oras also has access to virtually every nonevent legendary ever released though some are version specific except the xyz trio mewtwo and the kanto birds the only things not strictly obtainable from are basically just weird movesets because of odd tms something we wont get to make use of until january in in xy theres also a bunch of stuff only in friend safaris which is strictly speaking obtainable in the game but as with mirage spots is kind of a pain for the purposes of collecting
pokemon,not_removed,maybe shaymin as far as i rmember its only been distributed since its initial appearance in oaks letter
pokemon,not_removed,you can but there are some that are common in rby that are much harder to get in gen vi like spearow of course you can get almost anything by trading
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure you can get the winter sawsbuck from friend safari but yeah your point stands otherwise
pokemon,not_removed,its entirely possible they wont let the glitch mew through bank just an fyi more than anything
pokemon,not_removed,by fused lauren you mean his black and white variants correct because those are totally available in at the very least oras if not x and y
pokemon,not_removed,according to serebii glameow can be found in the mirage forest in oras
pokemon,not_removed,this i know people who are stockpiling glitch mews i keep reminding them that glitch mew being banned from bank is not only a possibility but very likely
pokemon,not_removed,oh im sure it will be blocked but it still possible that it could get through since japan did get a proper event and they might think it will just be easier to let all mew through
pokemon,not_removed,they should let it through but give the glitched ones a new model based on the original sprite
pokemon,not_removed,yes but the one from cant be put into bank while fused
pokemon,not_removed,as well as in white in a hidden grotto
pokemon,not_removed,yeah same one as porygon
pokemon,not_removed,they could level up the mew and make it look like a legit
pokemon,not_removed,considering my tests with importing things from gen v through bank its very easy for them to block one and not the other
pokemon,not_removed,man i hope not i have a box full of lvl mews obtained through the glitch that i was planning on wonder trading away come january
pokemon,not_removed,my point is you can put the base parts in the bank and still get the dna splicers or whatever it is theyre called in game meaning as long as you get those you can fuse them in oras and have the same kyurem as in b and w
pokemon,not_removed,thatsnot how it works
pokemon,not_removed,i enjoyed this
pokemon,not_removed,and yet i have a friend that sent an entire live dex that he hacked through the pokebank including mythical pokemon the point is gen things save a lot less data about what you catch than now such as things not being flagged as events which could make it even more difficult to get block the glitch mew while letting the actual mew through
pokemon,not_removed,i know but if the system is flawed to prevent shiny jirachis in transporter theres a good hope for mew as well
pokemon,not_removed,heh
pokemon,not_removed,no i get it i messed around with it wondering why very certain ones would not work i had a few legendaries primarily deoxys and mew that would not transfer due to not having the fateful encounter flag set gen iii where they came from didnt have that flag just a location named such when pal parked properly i believe the flag gets set but i didnt have a ds lite to do so so i had to use a program to convert them which obviously didnt change that flag and thats all it took to block them was easy to fix however and more modern programs do it correctly and i also know the gen i data format contains much less but it does contain trainer id trainer name is stored elsewhere in the save but those two things are all it needs
pokemon,not_removed,i guess that could work i feel bad for the guy in japan that made his player name the same as the distributors name for mew event as a joke and somehow got the same id ids were a lot simpler in gen so its more likely than you might think
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt have a ds lite to do so so i had to use a program to convert them its possible to use pal park with desmume you just put the sav of the gen game in the gba slot thats how i get the pokemon i use to beat gen games on emulators in my phone into bank and my retail gen carts
pokemon,not_removed,why would you feel bad for him if his trainer idgendername matched his glitch mew would actually work considering theres not caught location and other such bits
pokemon,not_removed,it was far simpler to use a program and ive worked through any problems i might of had and as i mentioned newer programs do it properly now well more so a single program can now do it all even bypassing bank if you so wish
pokemon,not_removed,theyre suggesting that it wouldnt work and that legit event mew wouldnt be transferable either
pokemon,not_removed,except the whole point of that conversation was to point out how they would restrict glitch mew and still allow the event one by allowing the event one someone who has the same name and tid as it could get their glitch mew through just fine what youre saying is the exact opposite of what the conversation was about
pokemon,not_removed,the name of this mysterious magazine is never mentioned so we cannot confirm that it is a reliable source
pokemon,not_removed,honestly anyone who still believes megas are out are in denial dexio and sina return from xy and both wear mega bracelets mega stone slot on zring and you cant use them together except mega rayquaza on the same pokemon anyways its a major battle mechanic they dont remove those weather wasnt removed double battles werent removed megas wont be removed serebii has stated there will be more mega merch for not official but hes the most reliable unofficial source out there weve seen a poster with the starters lunala solgaleo and mega glalie
pokemon,not_removed,so how do you explain mega glalie in the official artwork how about prof sycamores assistant in the official trailer wearing what looks like a mega bracelet
pokemon,not_removed,thanks for that do we know how reliable the source is and what the context of the statement is i e speculative vs factual
pokemon,not_removed,from my research it looks like the metal mega glalie was a part of the metal collection for xyz it just happened to have been promoted and released around the time sun and moon info was being published as well as for the mega bracelets the place on the playable trainers bracelet for a stone is speculative until we actually see a keystone placed there the lab assistants bands could be zrings for all we know saying theyre mega bracelets is also speculation
pokemon,not_removed,the v jump magazine had stuff about the hyper training previously and also the pyukumuku minigame
pokemon,not_removed,have you clicked the link you can clearly see that mega glalie is pictured in a sun and moon promo if it were for xy why would there be a massive picture of lunala as for the bracelet you are right about speculation
pokemon,not_removed,does it not strike you as odd that the mega glalie is made out of metal ive seen verlisifys click bait video sun and moon were just being promoted on the same material as these things
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt feel like making it my fc anymore so i just made it a random phrase off the top of my head im glad its such a hit
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,thanks i didnt know that sometimes its annoying playing in the game and the game being night in certain light is very hard to see the screen
pokemon,not_removed,xpost referenced from rcosplay by ubleekr excited to bring spark and pikachu to i am a bot i delete my negative comments httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetooriginalpostsearcher httpsgithubcompapernotesredditoriginalpostsearcher httpsgithubcompapernotesredditoriginalpostsearcherfaq
pokemon,not_removed,i like the rockfire combination i want to see a rocknormal combination could be like a sabertoothed tiger or some other form of mammal i also think a rockpoison combination could be fun yes i know both of those pokemon would have weaknesses but thats been a standard for a lot of rock pokemon since the beginning
pokemon,not_removed,im with you on the stegosaurus were long overdo for one of those for the other i would love to see a pokemon based on a therizinosaurus or an ancient amphibian like a diplocaulus
pokemon,not_removed,i made a rockfire steg fossil poke for my rom hack named stegma stegarmor so i would love to see one in an actual game hawaii has an extinct flightless bird that might be cool to see as a reference to alolas inspiration maybe a rockground type emu thing
pokemon,not_removed,some sort of raptor or terror bird maybe rockdark with the alola region id say a plesiosaur or a mosasaur but there are already too many rockwater types a rockbug or rockpoison giant mosquito could be interesting as well
pokemon,not_removed,i like the idea of a fire volcano fossil and it should be paired with a water fossil too waterrock mosasaurus or waterdragon megalodon or maybe instead of fossilsyou resurrect pokemon from tikis
pokemon,not_removed,maybe a triceratops
pokemon,not_removed,i like a lot of the ideas presented here what i would like regardless of what fossil pokemon were given is for them to have a three stage evolution
pokemon,not_removed,a pterasuar and a pleasiosuar and maybe a third one evo one you get in the end game
pokemon,not_removed,the moanalo thatd be pretty awesome to have even better if it were to evolve into a new zealand moa which is a huge extinct flightless bird not too dissimilar in appearance
pokemon,not_removed,lol like the ancient roc its literally a rock now and a rockbug mosquito could work as theyre found in amber all the time i keep imagining a rock scorpion for rockpoison
pokemon,not_removed,bastiodon is kinda of a triceratops but i think bastiodons look more like the chasmosaurinae which are also in the ceratopsia family
pokemon,not_removed,yes that one and i agree to the nz moa too it would have to have moa in its name obviously maybe have rockhardened legfeet scales stonecrystal leg spurs and head spike edit damn it had to i made moaglite moagtite cuz the head spikes are like stalagtites httpiimgurcomemgbqcfjpg
pokemon,not_removed,huh i did not know that
pokemon,not_removed,this is amazing i would have this in my party imagine riding one like a rhyhorn or gogoat in xy i wonder what second type itd have couldnt be part flying so probaly ground or grass steel or dark would be pretty interesting too
pokemon,not_removed,why ty kindly id love to ride one too could certainly use it like gogoat to leap over ravines or travel quickly im thinking it would be part ground as its a grounddwelling bird
pokemon,not_removed,actually im pretty sure the alolan champion is called ben trust me i played the game hes a pretty cool dude
pokemon,not_removed,cute id ask you to draw mine but i didnt get my game until today and i havent bought any cosmetics yet whats up with the skirt 😳
pokemon,not_removed,no panties though l jokes aside nice art mate keep em comin
pokemon,not_removed,great job totally keep it up
pokemon,not_removed,as far as art goes its good as far as sugimori tho youre way off
pokemon,not_removed,this is pretty good im a sucker for sugimori art so this is really cool id love to see more of your stuff posted here in the future
pokemon,not_removed,i wish i could draw this wellbest i could do is pay someone to commission my mc
pokemon,not_removed,i think my character wears the same outfit as yours just in different colors and a different hair style clearly you are a person of taste
pokemon,not_removed,cheeky
pokemon,not_removed,the style is quite flattering nicely done to make it so everything isnt just thats nice looks good and to give some hopefully helpful criticism with certainly no intent to offend but help the head is tilted but the eyes seem to be level
pokemon,not_removed,for a minute i thought it was some sort of anthropomorphic fox or something just the thumbnail from the corner of my eye i was slightly disappointed
pokemon,not_removed,nice
pokemon,not_removed,unzips
pokemon,not_removed,this kinda triggers me this is the type of art where you are supposed to cover the middle area with a leg
pokemon,not_removed,i would like to meet ben
pokemon,not_removed,yeah the alolan champion is ben
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know how to draw sitting skirts was just trying to
pokemon,not_removed,it would be too lewd xd
pokemon,not_removed,care to explain how off it is ive tried to copy the gen style of the official trainer artwork yes its way off oldsugimori but i think its kinda close to the recent ones
pokemon,not_removed,appreciate the critique
pokemon,not_removed,i hear hes always open to meeting new people
pokemon,not_removed,still better than my stick figures xd
pokemon,not_removed,this might sound weird but watch some school anime to help with the skirts you can stop and see how the physics are applied per frame in different situations and practice drawing them as a male hobby animator skirts can be difficult
pokemon,not_removed,pantiless is too lewd dont ya think x
pokemon,not_removed,sorry when someone says sugimori style they usually automatically refer to the original style as for the gen style its good the only thing you need to work on are proportions and body features your skeleton is all over the place might be the shadows in that case work on the shadows too for example her rib cage is too thin and cylindrical also dont know if its me or not but some lines the outline seem blurrier than others
pokemon,not_removed,its not pantyless its just not shown i think d
pokemon,not_removed,i see thanks for the constructive critique im just drawing for a hobby and looking to improve it further
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i was thinking of gen style too but this is rather spot on for the gen style
pokemon,not_removed,unless she is wearing a thong you would see her underwear in a pose like this maybe something you want to fix up a little ie do some pose references unless thats what you are going for lol
pokemon,not_removed,yep gotta improve on that i was aiming for something like well it didnt work out too well xd
pokemon,not_removed,ah i see i think she is on a different angle so you see her cheeks lol funny to be talking about this but if you are looking more straight on like in your pic you would actually be able to see her undies but you know id never try a pose like this cause its too complex for me kudos to you for taking a stab at it and doing a decent job
pokemon,not_removed,id like some part of the xy gang to carry over to alola but i dont see any of them actually doing that sadly clemont would likely stay in kalos to help with rebuilding lumiose city after how lysandre destroyed it and given next weeks episode is hinting at the destruction of clembot he would probably have no one to delegate his gym leader duties to bonnie would definitely not go to alola alone without her brother also because the kid has always been an extra member in both groups it happened so far ag and xy and bonnie is not becoming ten anytime soon and while i like serena the way the showcase arc ended makes me think she will accept palermos offer to train under her wing to become the next kalos queen also given how her arc was all about starting clueless and unsure of what she wanted to do before finding her dream and striving hard to make it real if she gave up her dream to follow ash even if she likes him it would feel like a character regression of the worst kind to set aside her dreams like this and i dont really see the showcases carrying over to alola
pokemon,not_removed,i definitely want serena back best pokegirl so far not really fussed on who else he travels with i can imagine brock having an interesting dynamic with serena but would somewhat undermine ash taking the leader role having brock back but will be interesting to see i just hope they dont reset ash to bw levels keep him as the more competent leader that his companions can look up to like in xyz
pokemon,not_removed,im not caught up just yet but i dont see clemont or bonnie as much as it would fit her going to alola i feel like serena has a decent chance because not only is she a canon love interest but i cant really imagine lillie or femmc traveling with ash same with the trial captains mallow cooks though so that might be a bad sign
pokemon,not_removed,xyz ends with ash and friends restoring peace to kalos years later ash is now and decides to stay with serena in kaloskanto they get married and have kids more years later ashs son is now and can begin his journey in alola he replaces the role of ash everyone lives happily ever after including us amourshippers
pokemon,not_removed,its possible serena would training under palermo wouldnt benefit her but in alola she could hone her skills and catch some new pokemon perfect for performing eg oricorio before returning to kalos at some stage to have another shot at becoming kalos queen
pokemon,not_removed,if mallow cooks though thatd be more of the niche that clemont had wouldnt it
pokemon,not_removed,and while ash is retired in alola bonnie is the undefeated champion of kalos with her dedenne floette tyrantrum lapras xerneas and zygarde and shiny treverant that she rotates in
pokemon,not_removed,the problem is then what would she do aside from training if she doesnt have her own goal for alola shed basically be like she used to be in the first third of the series where she contributed barely nothing to the team dynamic or had much going on for her aside for her crush for ash and i really dont want serena to regress to that writingwise unless theres something serena can do in alola aside from training i think going under palermos wing is a better choice id like to see serena but i also want her to further her character development if she were to appear rather than just be there
pokemon,not_removed,i think shed have a better chance if she traveled alone we have evidence of the traveling companions improving when ash isnt with them
pokemon,not_removed,yeah but ash never brings two girls along so if theyre keeping with the tradition mallow is a pretty convenient character being both a girl and chef
pokemon,not_removed,thats true then again they pulled kanto contests out of their ass for may in battle frontier so nothing says they couldnt add in showcasessomething similar for serena in alola
pokemon,not_removed,well serena seems like shed be a different case due to the fact being with ash kinda motivates her though perhaps alone shed focus soley on training
pokemon,not_removed,hmmm thats true i guess well have to wait and see
pokemon,not_removed,the big difference however is that battle frontier was still considered part of advanced generation it was a different challenge for ash and somewhat different for may but still considered part of the hoenn series one thing that also leads me to not think they will bring serena to alola is that since they started dividing the anime in series they tried to make them mostly standalone to each other except for the original series which ended on a cliffhanger with pikachu in danger of dying to the point each new series has next time a new beginning instead of to be continued unlike every other episode while continuity nods do happen and can be quite important they tend to be few and far in between and carrying over an entire plotline from the previous show seems a bit too much its not something i really enjoy but its how the anime works and as long as serena has a good sendoff i will be alright if she comes to alola i will be pleasantly surprised but i dont expect her to
pokemon,not_removed,i guess but in the same vein alola would be a different challenge for ash as well so if they wanted to they could bring serena in as well and yes usually they make them mostly standalone but keep in mind brock was brought back for two of those new beginnings so doesnt rule it out we wont know for certain whether or not serena will return until they reveal it theres definitely arguments that can be made for her leaving and for her staying
pokemon,not_removed,im not saying its not arguable far from it i just expect them to give a logical reason for serenas stay if it happens and not treat her like wallpaper to the rest of the cast with no goal aside from her training as i said i have my reasons for believing she wont come but i will be pleasantly surprised if she does
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i getcha
pokemon,not_removed,thats just bad
pokemon,not_removed,true although its worth mentioning that its not either of their faults lusamine because poison and their dad for not being around
pokemon,not_removed,i feel like n would be very confused by that sub
pokemon,not_removed,i just checked that out and im not quite sure that they know what narrcissim is
pokemon,not_removed,their dad for not being around doesnt gladion say that their dad disappeared through the ultra wormhole and thats supposedly one reason lusamine is so obsessed with ultra space
pokemon,not_removed,nah the poison isnt the sole reason for lusamine going loco it just pushed her further off the edge we aint even sure if she got infected the first time or just at the very end
pokemon,not_removed,the point is that their parents are terrible
pokemon,not_removed,isnt gladion and lillies father the bozo who lives on poke pelago
pokemon,not_removed,wont lie until i read that on here yesterday i didnt even notice mohn had the same blond hair and green eyes as lillie lusamine and gladion he even has a bit of that funky hair sticking out from under his hat like gladion edit also will add until the story made i apparently clear that gladion and lillie were the children of lusamine i also didnt noticed the three of them all had the same blond hair and green eyes i am not very observant evidently
pokemon,not_removed,apparently
pokemon,not_removed,mind blown moment for me
pokemon,not_removed,also apprently mohn was a reseacher on ultra space way back when and published papers on it i think a scientist in the first town of the second island mentioned this
pokemon,not_removed,this games story is pretty fuckin deep if i do say so myself
pokemon,not_removed,im more impressed that it is able stand up on its own very well made
pokemon,not_removed,thats super well done wow
pokemon,not_removed,picture of the back as well
pokemon,not_removed,thanks i can tell a ton of work went into it
pokemon,not_removed,slowpokejpg
pokemon,not_removed,and hitmontop is named after
pokemon,not_removed,the japanese ones are named after japanese fighty people too
pokemon,not_removed,httpiimgurcomulsmwsdjpg feedback welcome at rimagelinkerbot with ignore me via reply or pm
pokemon,not_removed,to be honest i dont believe you should post this here itll possibly get locked once the flaming starts thats just my opinion though with regards to verlisify at least his cheating topic i believe he is correct however he is going about this in the wrong way and hunting down cheaters most people believe that his beliefs against cheating are to get views on youtube and this is why he is incorrectly calling out many youtubers if he truly believed that cheating was wrong and a good person he couldve potentially asked his fans to ask tcpi to create a method to get pokemon that is not based on rng just my cents though
pokemon,not_removed,im familiar with youtube drama among channel owners its nothing but a shilled war with their subscribers defending them or offending for them its not pretty nor i feel this is right to discussion here because the majority of us arent involved in this and making it more aware will make things worse the best thing to do is let it die out on its own
pokemon,not_removed,im convinced verlisify is a troll because of how impossible it is for someone to be that hypocritical on accident he created a minute rant attacking jethrotexs video one of his points was that it was minutes long because jethro was desperate for views then when hoodlumscrafty retaliates and points out a ton of instances when verlisify has attacked stolen and lied to fans and fellow creators verlisify claims to be the victim of bullying and drama tl dr verlisify starts drama for attention
pokemon,not_removed,i think youll have more luck discussing this over on vp they seem to be very much into it unlike rpokemon
pokemon,not_removed,he also clickbaits a lot
pokemon,not_removed,that rant video was edit unnessesary jethrotex has his own style for videos if anything verliss video about it was desperate for attention there was nothing wrong with jeths vid so there was no reason to attack compared to when who pulled that whole stream incident its a good thing jethrotex has no bad reaction to it and actually got more views out of it
pokemon,not_removed,clickbait is wrong ethically but calling people out for cheating falsely is worse search wolfe glick on google and top results will have verlis falsely calling out wolfe
pokemon,not_removed,how long will these be available i dont have my on me
pokemon,not_removed,i used darkrai thank you
pokemon,not_removed,just tried arceus and it was taken worth a shot
pokemon,not_removed,fml lol
pokemon,not_removed,haha lol not even like minutes
pokemon,not_removed,youre welcome
pokemon,not_removed,i just entered it 😩
pokemon,not_removed,the absolute hell of getting the regis comes to mind
pokemon,not_removed,i remember first stumbling across zapdos in blue had a distinctly different feel than the climactic storyentwined legendary battles of more recent gens i dont know which i prefer more but in oras theres plenty of legendaries you never need to encounter but can find adventuring to the mirage spots this combined with the plot and the delta episode gives the best of both worlds in my opinion
pokemon,not_removed,only the main box legendaries have this problem really every game still has other legendaries that are found in dungeonsplaces you cant explore the regis rayquaza in rs heatran regigigas giratina in dp the musketeers kyurem in bw and zygarde fit more in line with the gen one way of handling legends going into the games blind until gen and hopefully going in blind again for gen i was surprised to find most of them while exploring their dungeons just for the sake of exploring them and they all felt rewarding to find outside of the box legendaries and latis in oras theyre being handled the same way they always have been its just the advent of the internet and some of them being given a role in the story that makes it seem like theyre less special
pokemon,not_removed,i dont really see an issue with one legendary a few more in oras but that was out of a much greater number than any other game had being given to you when there still are legendaries that arent having both ways is better than only having only optional legendaries in my opinion the real issue i have is in the fact that only one of the four kanto legendaries was handled well i willingly acknowledge that mewtwo was probably the besthandled legendary in the series because it was foreshadowed and given an interesting story in a mandatory location cinnabar mansion but in itself was optional but the winged mirages were just there without any reason to be mewtwo had a story and was optional best of both worlds judging from how commonly people wish legendaries werent handed out but the winged mirages were no more special than snorlax were at the time sure there were two snorlax rather than one but there was still no breeding either one and you could only find them in the overworld heck snorlax at least had a point i agree that its nice to have to go out and hunt for something but i despise when theres nothing that makes that something worth hunting why should i hunt for say zapdos its a little stronger than another pokémon but its not special there is nothing mysterious about a yellow bird unless youre told its legendary now being told that terminus cave was abandoned due to rumors of a terrifying monster zygarde and that zygarde has a secret power to protect the environment makes it interesting being shown even better that mewtwo is the modified child of the rarest pokémon and is the most savage pokémon is exciting its awesome being told oh wait i cant finish that zapdos is just there that makes it inherently less interesting in my opinion same goes for the other winged mirages im just running with a consistent example here to be honest i would willingly get behind the notion that legendary pokémon should be optional and not forced i dont mind the mascots being given but i also dont require it and wouldnt oppose making them optional again either but i do have to disagree that kanto did legendaries better than the rest because theres nothing interesting about three of the four kanto legendaries im personally of the belief that its fine to have the mascot show up in the story and i especially like that the mascots usually tie in with the other legendaries somehow yeah you just got the dialga for free but now you know so much more about the creation myth giving you enough context for the limited information on all the others that you understand their stories and want to have those amazing pokémon that helped make the world or were born at the beginning of time isnt that so much better than oh cool another bird like the fire one i just got this ones name suggests its the second theres presumably a first one then i wonder where it could be ensuring you a taste and enticing you is doing the legendaries right be it with ingame foreshadowing mewtwo or actually seeing a legendary and learning all of their stories mascots i dont have a preference so long as its done just putting them there though just doesnt work in my eyes cx
pokemon,not_removed,i think because pokémons primary demographic is young kids a linear form of gameplay is less confusing to me even though you get to choose your own name and team it isnt an immersive organic adventure because you have to go through a series of consecutive events to complete the game so i agree with the argument that the legendary pokémon arent really legendary while rare and impressive theyre still just part of the story shiny pokémon are more legendary to me than the official legendaries
pokemon,not_removed,id agree if it wasnt for the fact that of the catchable legendaries in the game offer nothing lore wise
pokemon,not_removed,legendary pokémon are not legendary because they are hard to find
pokemon,not_removed,you talk about it like we dont have any rare legendaries anymore even though it is literally only box mascots that are actually handed to you through the story every single game since gold and silver the very first games to use legendary mascots mind you have had secondary legendaries that you had to search for in the exact same way as the birds from rgby entei raikou and suicune the three regis the musketeers regigigas from oras all of these and many more were all hidden away either in the same way as articuno zapdos and moltres or in even more convoluted ways than those youre all missing the big picture here there are other legendaries than the ones on the boxarts
pokemon,not_removed,remembers the hell of discovering and trying to find the regis for the first time i think not
pokemon,not_removed,gen one didnt do it better gen perfected it they were shoved in the story but their legends are scattered about through the region making you curious of them wanting to learn more and search them
pokemon,not_removed,im torn because i like how epic the stories have become i mean you get a parade in x and meet a year old man however i miss the adventure i miss chasing down raiku and entei and then finding out i can hunt the birds too
pokemon,not_removed,other than roaming legends regardless of their role in the story all legendary pokemon have technically had a set place in the games for people to encounter personally i feel that the amount of legends and the role in the story mode shouldnt influence how legendary something is or isnt at all they should be judged on their individual worth
pokemon,not_removed,you make an interesting point however i think the way gen did its legends was better one or two legends palkia and dialga are actually handed to you mind you theyre quite hard to catch but youre still forced to encounter them and the rest you have to hunt for even the mythical pokemon had sidequests you had to accomplish manaphy even required that you beat a whole pokemon spinoff game thats awesome to me
pokemon,not_removed,i just wish theyd make another pokemon game that doesnt end up with some ancient prophecy about me saving the world the reason red the character is so liked is because hes just simply the greatest pokemon master and reached it by his own merit and not because the plot said so
pokemon,not_removed,really only the cover pokemon are handed to you other legends are still tough
pokemon,not_removed,in my opinion i hated the story of rby a little because it was so anticlimactic they were stealing pokemon which is bad but its not a super threatening scenario you couldve gone through the whole game ignoring them and it wouldve ended up the same for you where as talking gsc the reformed rocket was causing a global problem that wouldve definitely hurt the region beyond repair again legendaries were still optional but the story itself was more effecting than first gen and with later gens the legendaries were catastrophic in their strength so of course theyre going to be abused by people who think their strength is the only way to further their goals
pokemon,not_removed,in oras youre guaranteed a rayquaza but catching a fucking ralts or nosepass takes hours wtf
pokemon,not_removed,its mostly because of who the game is directed toward but who it attracts they need to make the game easier since its for but for us im guessing most of us here arent children its too easy and we find them to be handed to us our puzzle solving skills are more developed so we just rush through the game because we know where to go and what to do quicker than the target audience edit all i am gonna say though is that deoxys and rayquaza are too easy to get
pokemon,not_removed,i feel the legendaries make the story what it is i feel they make the story powerful
pokemon,not_removed,really only one legendary that versions mascot is usually a mandatory part of the story in the newer games some of the other legendaries are quite difficult to find let alone catch those regis were no joke for example
pokemon,not_removed,i guess kyureum in wb is a pain in the ass to catch and i dont really recall much of a hint towards catching it other than someone mentioning there was an evil pokemon that ate people not to mention you had heatran who just kind of existed in gen iv same thing with giratina in dp it was just part of this weird area that showed up and was in a cave that a pain to get through no offense but it could just been because you were younger
pokemon,not_removed,what theyve did in was pretty cool where you couldnt capture kyurem the first time only defeat it and only after the story you can capture it but yeah i hate it when they shove the legendary pokémon during your adventure and force you to capture it since if you defeat it you cant get him later or they want that you fight it again which sucks for being an independent player in the game
pokemon,not_removed,no you are not a ten year old trying to become the best in the newer games you are a chosen hero whom those legendaries trust and let themselves be caught by you are still ten but you are a hero keep that in mind becuse thats the reason why ash doesnt catch legendaries
pokemon,not_removed,see with the first game you can just randomly stumble upon them and not know they will kick your butt going through seafoam islands and boom waaahhh omg omg finally getting all badges and going through victory road and boom awesome another one and then trying to find zapdos since he was out of the way mewtwo would come later as you went by that cave while looking for zapdos they were there and you could get two of them after getting surf and strength moltres was a chore because of victory road but worth it
pokemon,not_removed,didnt nintendo recently talk about changing things up with the legendaries on sun and moon
pokemon,not_removed,i agree but i think the other legendaries can do this quite well except for gen vi where they forgot about other legendaries
pokemon,not_removed,i understand where youre coming from but part of how the legendaries were handed and referenced might just have something to do with how they chose to focus the story lately the story is fairly cookie cutter with a heavy emphasis on the legendary which is where i think youre biggest critique lies youd prefer more mystery i can agree i think that silver and gold did it best it wasnt laid on thick how important they were the story focused on your journey the resurgence of a criminal organization and treading through some old stomping grounds there was more legendary lore and story but it wasnt entirely necessary diamond and pearl did some of this as well regarding giratina who was only mentioned in passing barely and fairly hard to find
pokemon,not_removed,i think emerald handled it well it had a centralized story around the legendaries but you didnt catch any of them you still had to go and find them after they went back to rest it was the perfect mix of adventure and plot driven legendaries
pokemon,not_removed,my favourite games re legendaries is gen i played the shit out of my original silver game but did i ever go catch lugia nope didnt need to the way the plot worked meant you could do that i also like the fact you can go catch both of the legendaries in the game should you so desire they should bring that back imo
pokemon,not_removed,personally i dont think it makes any sense to play a pokemon game thinking of it as your own adventure you dont make many choices at all you barely get to choose where you go i think it would be interesting to see a more rpg adventure type pokemon game but i wouldnt say pokemon as is could be qualified as that or would feel right like that so i think that fighting the legendaries is as forced as any other part of the story and i appreciate the atmosphere that is put around the battle with it
pokemon,not_removed,i agree with most of the people here regarding legendaries needing to have more lore to them however i love when a legendary is in a cooltough to get to spot like traveling through a long cave with a bunch of trainers and high leveled wild pokemon traversing through a dark forest to find a small opening with a shrine climbing a huge abandoned tower to me the location is a big part i dont mind finding them on routes like the dogs but thats only because theyre known for roaming and quickly running away when spotted plus the design has to be cool i wish they would adapt real animals again like dogs and birds instead of making these extremely intricate designs that arent really anything heatran
pokemon,not_removed,i like that the legendaries are tied into the story it makes more sense for them being there the events in the plot cause the legendary to emerge where you can then battle it and capture it whats the alternative the legendary is just sitting around in a cave sleeping where anyone could just stumble across it that doesnt seem very legendary to me neither was the whole random legendary being summoned through hoopa rings in oras tying them to the story gives them a purpose for being there and more motivation to encounter them
pokemon,not_removed,in oras you are given latiaslatios and i actually mean given they just join your party and to make it worse they already have a mega stone on them then steven just gives you a mega ring right after so you can immediately have a mega at least when youre given lucario is xy you at least feel like you earn it a bit since that lucario appears earlier and you actually have to win a battle with him first in order to be allowed to keep him plus he isnt a legendary pokémon
pokemon,not_removed,this thank you make them part of the story but quit making these legendary beasts getting caught by the bad team the best legendaries in game was gsc for the reason that the entire game just felt dark the music was eerie the crazy bellsprout monks the architecture of the buildings the dope tower where a legendary is said to live the legendary that left and hid deep in these caves the burnt tower running into the dogs in the wild and them being allusive af and of course the all mighty mewtwo posting up after you have completed the game screw it make another remake lol edit cant forget the unknown useless but super cool beans
pokemon,not_removed,i wholeheartedly agree on top of that there was no internet back then at least it want widespread or efficient resulting in the creation of believable rumours and us having to actually explore the whole region
pokemon,not_removed,i think some of the problem is i no longer feel any drive to get all the massive amounts of legendaries that currently exist each game contains so many from previous generations that it takes away from this feeling of rarity kinda like how all the shiny manipulation techniques exist
pokemon,not_removed,legendaries in the story are fun when it makes sense like in rs dp and the delta episode you could have removed the involvement of legendaries in bw and xy and they would have worked fine
pokemon,not_removed,the plot of pokemon is just stale as fuck in general kid leaves town to go on an adventure kid decides to go to the pokemon league kid stumbles upon evil team said kid is somehow able to disrupt operations evil team unveils master plan involving the box legendaries after the gym kid catches legendary pokemon in some cinematic way evil team dissolves kid goes on to pokemon league having the legendary pokemon actually feel legendary would be great
pokemon,not_removed,honestly if it werent for attempting to get a shiny charm and keep it through the generations id release every legendary i received the great thing about the gen legendaries is that they were purely optional i loathe all of the legendaries for what i play the game for they add nothing i dont want to hunt for them i dont want to use them i dont want to interact with them unfortunately i need to catalog them
pokemon,not_removed,first gensecond gen handled legendary pokemon the best there is nothing you could tell me to sway that opinion i really wish they were not central to the games main plots now
pokemon,not_removed,i completely agree
pokemon,not_removed,im with you and id love to get rid of event pokemon i want a legendary to be that pokemon that does x not the prize from attending pokecon japan
pokemon,not_removed,so in platinum you couldnt get regigigas without having the other three regis in your party and then there was an event regigigas that let you find the other three regis in new caves exclusive to platinum which you could then use to get the default regigigas how does that make sense haha
pokemon,not_removed,i cant even image getting the in the original games with no internet access how the hell am i supposed to figure out those things
pokemon,not_removed,thats what legendary hunting should be it should be a bunch of people putting together clues of random dots they find and solving puzzles
pokemon,not_removed,i feel like part of the reason the regis felt more mysterious and epic to me was that the method of obtaining them was cryptic
pokemon,not_removed,you know what would have been really cool if the mirage spots were like portals to the other regions instead of portals that legendaries just fall out of for example hoohs mirage spot could teleport you to tin tower and you would challenge him there of course you would only be limited to tin tower and not the rest of johto but thats just my take edit in addition to my comment i think a change like this would allow the newer players to appreciate the legendaries from previous generations and what kind of background they have if oras was my first game then all id know about these legendaries is that theyre powerful pokemon if their entire location eg mt coronet spear pillar for dialgapalkia distortion world for giratina lake x for uxiemespritazelf were included you would get a better sense of each legendarys identity
pokemon,not_removed,this it was such a pleasant surprise to find a legendary pokemon and you felt like youd really accomplished something i still remember year old me immediately resetting pokemon sapphire when i first found rayquaza which i think was months after i got the game because of how awe inspiring it was and how i needed the master ball i was
pokemon,not_removed,yeech i dont much care for the mirage spots theyre just so soulless it felt like they were just shoving every legendary pokemon into the game because reasons i understand wanting to let the newer generations have a means of getting legends without having to use older games but shoving them all into one game just makes them feel cheap
pokemon,not_removed,the main box legendaries are usually the most important
pokemon,not_removed,well in redblueyellow in one of the buildings that connect different routes you can actually go upstairs and catch a glimpse of articuno in a pair of binoculars its not much but it definitely made kid me go what the hell is that thing why havent i seen one of those before
pokemon,not_removed,i think the legendary birds in gen were actually handled well there are places where you can look in binoculars and see them and its a really cool reward for fully exploring places you dont have to if youre just going through the story i think it adds to the feeling of exploring and discovering new things in the game
pokemon,not_removed,zygarde was the best legenedary of recent gens because of this
pokemon,not_removed,shiny pokemon arent legendary theyre albino
pokemon,not_removed,pretty much this if anything doesnt it make more sense that in a world with bad people and legends that exist there would be people seeking that power to abuse it its not like everyone out there believes it heck youve got someone from sinnoh in kalos elite four who refers to sinnohs legends as stories she was told as a child as far as i remember
pokemon,not_removed,but they are legendary because to most people theyre just myths most npcs legitimately think legendaries may not be real having fixed legendary encounters takes away that intrigue
pokemon,not_removed,immediately latioslatias come to mind after reading your first sentence also you didnt have to encounter any legendaries in gold and silver you could just skip the box mascots as well it would be interesting to not have to encounter the box mascots and not know exactly where to find them
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt even know hooh and lucia were catchable until my friend told me where i could find them this was after i beat red in two different saves
pokemon,not_removed,genwunners blaming the fact they arent kids anymore on the games
pokemon,not_removed,i have to admit that out of all the legendary puzzles the one for the regis in rse and oras is the best one by far its just ingenious
pokemon,not_removed,man i was trying to catch entei in soul silver and god i just gave up after like minutes of trying to get it the game will always put it past a cave that i dont want to go through
pokemon,not_removed,but i feel like having to find the legendaries on your own almost made it more epic it felt like an actual choice something that you did all by yourself you conquered this beast that people talk about like some sort of myth and you did it by yourself the newer games just dont capture that feeling for me because i know that everyone had the same locked encounter by default its literally unavoidable
pokemon,not_removed,ethan beat him ethans better
pokemon,not_removed,but it has also the wonder trade so you dont need take hours to catch a ralts i even have a box filled with ralts
pokemon,not_removed,in the past you had to work for rayquayza oras was pretty generous with legends giving you access to a ton with the hoopa portals and the lati twins joining you willingly rayquayza is guaranteed cause of the delta episode plot also gamefreak needed a reason to make rayquayza save the world for the fourth fucking time
pokemon,not_removed,man i remember years ago the puzzle with the moving stone ice skating was way hard for me and it took me solid weeks non stop playing to beat the game but now i need only days to beat the newer games since the puzzles are way to easy for adults
pokemon,not_removed,in the newer games you can defeat the legendary and then when you beat the it should be back iirc
pokemon,not_removed,actually calemserena are stated in the looker quests to be at least
pokemon,not_removed,yes they did they said that solgaleo and lunala would play a role that no other legendary have ever played in a pokémon game before they also said that zygarde would play a role at some point but it is unknown if they meant during the maingame or the postgame
pokemon,not_removed,there were video game magazines though
pokemon,not_removed,too true i dont think there always has to be an evil organization involved in order to have a good story
pokemon,not_removed,i guess they wanted you to palpark the three regis from rse no
pokemon,not_removed,youre not able to use the default regigigas to get the three other regis in those caves huh i always thought you had to use pal park to get the regis in order to get regigigas in order to get more regis or just use the event ones
pokemon,not_removed,when i was a kid grade iirc me and a friend found the cave trying to get to that dive spot because it was fun to figure out the patterns then we rented out a brail book to read the brail from our school librarys during recess
pokemon,not_removed,the only other ways i can think of is learning how from a friend or using the guidebook i had the guidebook and in the back of it there was a page where you could decipher the braille
pokemon,not_removed,strategy guides and word of mouth mainly in elementary school whoever had the strategy guide was pretty much the coolest kid in class i remember when i ran into moltreswas the only legendary you were really forced into encountering seeing the sprite in the overworld just sitting there in victory road blew my mind actually thinking about reminds me of how much i hated victory road as a kid i didnt have the strategy guide so i spent hours figuring out where to push the rocks
pokemon,not_removed,there was a braille guide included with the game but even then you cant expect a year old to sit down and decrypt braille i imagine there were probably a lot of older siblings triggering the events for their little siblings
pokemon,not_removed,i had the prima game guide book it was fun to read and i still have it and my other ones
pokemon,not_removed,to be fair mewtwo was kinda easy to find and the birds were found on locations you visited through the storyline
pokemon,not_removed,braille is not random dots
pokemon,not_removed,portals to the lagendaries locations would have been great ive never played gem or so even though i dont dislike those legendaries i dont really have any appreciation for them to me theyre just good pokemon that fell out of a portal
pokemon,not_removed,thatd be pretty cool actually as it is now they feel kinda unremarkable
pokemon,not_removed,all these darn mach bike traps have to lead somewhere
pokemon,not_removed,i think that the whole legendary experience similar to rse is intended for children more as an adult a term i use loosely regarding myself a year old being chosen to catch a legendary seems absurd but at the same time year old me ate this storytelling up
pokemon,not_removed,i certainly wouldve liked the roaming dogs roaming again at least although i thought the lugiahooh thing was really fun theres some interesting stuff to get the mirage spots to trigger but it seems kind of lazy youre right
pokemon,not_removed,they are the most important to the main plot but that doesnt take away how important they are to the world
pokemon,not_removed,but in the age of internet someone will hack the games post it online and the experience is ruined if you got spoiled many seem they dont bother about it but imagine if you find by yourself a legendary without any knowledge this will blow your mind
pokemon,not_removed,too bad it never had a chance to shine in terms of story
pokemon,not_removed,yeah that seems like a better analogy
pokemon,not_removed,youre talking about mythical pokémon the ones we only get through events are the ones the npcs dont believe actually exist ordinary legendaries are wellknown through regional folklore and well legends every johtonian knows who hooh and lugia are every welleducated hoennese knows who groudon and kyogre are every mythologist knows who dialga palkia mesprit uxie azelf and maybe even giratina are ever since generation legendary pokémon have been pokémon that people knew who were albeit not everyone and with some very few but still not considered mirages like mew celebi or jirachi are it may have been different in generation but it is simply not a series staple anymore that legendaries are completely unknown beings
pokemon,not_removed,legendary and myth arent the same thing something is legendary because it has a major impact if something has a legend made of it it means it has a story behind it it had a following that has been passed down but that doesnt mean its hard to find legendaries are legendary because their might and power has created legendary stories about them whether theyre hard to find or not has no impact on that so if anything this means that the bird trio in gen are the worst legendaries as they have no legend no story to tell theres no supplementary info about them in the games nothing
pokemon,not_removed,okay so theres additional legendaries you get handed for free doesnt change the fact that theres still other legendaries out there that act exactly the same as the birds from kanto
pokemon,not_removed,would it really be though people forget it was impossible to avoid the box mascots in the original games even if you picked venusaur your rival still had reds
pokemon,not_removed,i feel like the internet plays a major part in this too without the internet who would ever have found the regi trio in rse or cresselia and all the other roaming legendaries in dppt hgss and bw or the secret past legendaries in its important to distinguish what is gamefreaks doing and what is our own you cant blame the games for not being able to keep a secret anymore as the internet is sure to spoil you on the day release
pokemon,not_removed,i just find it unbelievable that people upvoted that post without a second of thought what op says is downright wrong yet it gets upvoted solely because they say something positive about gen just like how people who say something negative about gen no matter how innocent wellthought out or true it may be they get downvoted to oblivion and called out on it its okay to love gen just dont be a bitch about it people
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,thats why you pick routes with grass and just alternate between them
pokemon,not_removed,very true i have two xerneas because i played through x twice and used the poke bank to hold onto it from my first run through its cool to have two but makes it significantly less special than hunting it down i can play through as many times as i want and ill always catch it i still have not caught raiku in heart gold despite it being at and paralyzed
pokemon,not_removed,my point is these are just common animals in the world rayquaza is a space monster like you should have to work for that shit
pokemon,not_removed,rayquaza youre pronouncing and spelling it wrong
pokemon,not_removed,they are the villans
pokemon,not_removed,so let us hope then
pokemon,not_removed,than i suggest to watch this theory video he explains pretty much everything what the plot could be in sun moon
pokemon,not_removed,meh its not the same they dont provide as much information and werent as widespread as the internet is today
pokemon,not_removed,except you cant use those regis for this event
pokemon,not_removed,gen was pretty about specific event pokemon triggering other pokemon such as shinyspikyeared pichu in hgss
pokemon,not_removed,you have good friends
pokemon,not_removed,that was me and my little brother
pokemon,not_removed,wasnt it in mt ember
pokemon,not_removed,you didnt have to go to the seafoam islands at all you didnt have to go to the powerplant you didnt have to pass moltres to go through victory road
pokemon,not_removed,well at first they are a mystery and people need to figure out it is brail
pokemon,not_removed,gen is my favorite by far i completed my living dex on that generation and thats when i first got into competitive play the battle subway was amazing i logged over hours on black and around on black i would try to find a good deal on platinum and any gen game if you can and play them i skipped gen and got back in on gen so those games have a special place in my heart also i personally love the world of sinnoh
pokemon,not_removed,yea oras mirage spots and soaring was cool and all but it really felt like ok now just go and collect the legendaries no big deal
pokemon,not_removed,the legendaries in oras were fan service mostly they needed a way of getting those pokemons onto peoples games without forcing them to get a ds at least or extra games and a pokebank sub so in a way i understand why they did it that way it is kinda lazy though
pokemon,not_removed,idk lugia and hooh the seas and skies groudon and kyogre the land and ocean dialga and palkia time and fucking space reshiram and zekrom truth and ideals yveltal and xerneas life and death lunala and solgaleo the sun and moon
pokemon,not_removed,i think youre responding to the wrong person i liked the way the old games did it wouldve been nice with more foreshadowing but i still liked it
pokemon,not_removed,but it wont blow my mind ive already explained that in a sixparagraph post given reasons for everything i said and supported exactly what i do find interesting and one person saying im not experiencing it right because of the internet isnt going to change my beliefs not everyones mind is blown by every creature they see because someone tells them its legendary and thats a really lazy way of making an ordinary design like the winged mirages interesting more importantly the internet does exist and its faaar too big a gamble to assume every player in the world is going to stay off of the internet until theyve discovered every secret for themselves for it to be a reasonable expectation of fans in this day and age which means you cant rely on that to make a pokémon cool havent you heard of show dont tell dont just tell them its legendary and hope they find it on their own show them the legends and theyll be interested whether they have internet or not
pokemon,not_removed,with their rarity and ingame obscurity theyd function great as mythicals though if we have to be completely onthenose and technically correct about it
pokemon,not_removed,to be fair you could pick squirtle in red charmander in green or bulbasaur in blue and then your rival wouldt pick the mascot
pokemon,not_removed,im talking along the lines of gold and silver whereas the box mascots were the primary legendary pokemon you didnt have to encounter them in order to complete the game because they werent crucial to the plot of the games in every main series game since then the box mascotslegendaries have been incorporated into the stories it would be nice to reach the end of the game and realize you havent seen the cover legendary if only to switch things up
pokemon,not_removed,youre right the internet is a huge part of this discussion i really didnt start using it until gen v and its legendaries since i was really motivated to explore unova funny enough i havent caught any legendary besides kyurem and zekrom in yet cuz the sheer number of them and i dont know where to start i think what op wants and i agree with them is that we want a game similar to gen i and ii where there isnt a big emphasis on legendary pokémon weve had the same concept for a while now collect badges in gen v face evil team boss with a legendary summoned move on to badge credits in bw pokémon league in its time for a change in plot line
pokemon,not_removed,the only thing that you can do worse than say something negative about gen i is say something negative about hgss
pokemon,not_removed,the best part is in hgss entei and raiku have fucking roar in their moveset if you trap them and they use roar lol bye bye gone forever
pokemon,not_removed,yeah rayquaza was dope in emerald you had to wake him up so hed calm down kyogre and groudon then you could reclimb sky tower and spend a million ultra balls on him of course you could do this before challenging the elite four which essentially guaranteed a victory
pokemon,not_removed,actually what i typed is the officially pronunciation thats why i misspelled it cause i pronounce it properly tell me do you say plazaplahzah or plazaplayzah
pokemon,not_removed,ive already seen this i quite like it actually and its sad that they gave it such a shitty title and revolve it all around another theory thatll never come true the end of the franchise nobody here takes it seriously because of that even though it deserves so much more attention
pokemon,not_removed,i liked that gave us a reason to have them now they just take up box space
pokemon,not_removed,mt ember didnt exist in rby it was only in frlg
pokemon,not_removed,kiddo back in my day there was only one mountain it was filled with zubats
pokemon,not_removed,except you know its in the manual
pokemon,not_removed,those pokémon are the most important on their own game and again each game has about legendaries that are prevalent to the story and a bunch of other legendaries that you can decide to find if you want to and others that require events
pokemon,not_removed,really the swords of justice are quite literally on the paths youre required to go through first time around im not mocking you if youre getting those vibes im just genuinely curious of why you havent caught them
pokemon,not_removed,that is not what i gather from the wording of ops post all i see is someone complaining that legendaries arent legendary anymore because they arent like the ones from gen even though the majority of them actually are and it therefore simply isnt true with box legendaries maybe so but collectively complaining about all legendaries and calling out every generation as being inferior to gen simply seems narrowminded to me if op wanted to wish for a less legendaryoriented story they should have talked about the storyline of gen instead
pokemon,not_removed,its worse in fr and lg where that gone forever portion actually does happen i think thats the only set of games where that actually happens they dont do that in gold silver crystal or any other game its a glitch specifically for those gen games if they roar you away theyre literally gone forever hope you saved that master ball for them did i hear you ask why suicune doesnt have that problem even though it can learn roar too the answer is simple it used to have roar as a level up move in gold and silver just like its buddies raikou and entei in crystal it was a static encounter though roar on a static encounter no thanks they removed roar from its level up moves to prevent mass player annoyance caused by a static encounter roaring you away and disappearing forever because legendaries reappearing after the elite were beaten wasnt a thing until gen suicune has never learned roar through level up since so it never suffers the same problem raikou and entei do in fr and lg
pokemon,not_removed,well i ignore the theory about the franchise endingrebooting but i was more focused on all the connections every single pokémon generation had im just hyped for sun and moon story and we will see what happens
pokemon,not_removed,something something alternate timelines
pokemon,not_removed,was it really damn dude i made that harder than it needed
pokemon,not_removed,your point was that pokémon that are important to the world are still in usage of the gen model which isnt true gamefreak just hasnt handled legendaries properly
pokemon,not_removed,i know theyre on the routes i just went past them cuz i wasnt in the mood to catch them yet plus i already had them in bw so they werent anything special to me
pokemon,not_removed,til the legendary beasts were in frlg
pokemon,not_removed,if i remember right legendaries reappearing wasnt a thing until generation iv
pokemon,not_removed,me too everything else in the video is absolutely amazing and its astounding how much research that went into the making of it though there were a few graspings of straws i still believe about of the theory the connections and coincidences are just too uncanny to not be real
pokemon,not_removed,the manual there was a manual
pokemon,not_removed,i already had them too but i was bored
pokemon,not_removed,you get one and it depends on your starter entei if you picked bulbasaur raikou with squirtle and suicune with charmander
pokemon,not_removed,it started in frlg and carried over to emerald iirc i remember knocking out zapdos in fr and being very surprised to find it again in the power plant after beating the elite for the time a very pleasant surprise for a very noobish player for sure ruby and sapphire were the last games to not have it however i dont think it applied to roaming legendaries until gen iv
pokemon,not_removed,another reason to hate rs i guess
pokemon,not_removed,thats a nice tattoodra
pokemon,not_removed,im a tattoo artist and goodra is my all time favorite pokemon for some reason i want to do a goodra tattoo and if no one gets it i might just have one of my coworkers do it on me
pokemon,not_removed,if the circumstances were right id get that because it looks very crisp and welldesigned
pokemon,not_removed,it looks well done but no offense it looks like theres jizz everywhere
pokemon,not_removed,substitute would be better than disable yes you could then switch the safety goggles for leftovers
pokemon,not_removed,substitute blocks debuffs didnt know that
pokemon,not_removed,substitute blocks everything except for soundbased moves and select status moves
pokemon,not_removed,and pokémon with infiltrator
pokemon,not_removed,only if zebstrika donphan girafarig hippowdon and pyroar are all in the regional dex
pokemon,not_removed,that would be pretty cool there could be this whole backstory thing where the original safari zone is located in this region which influenced the construction of safari zones in the kanto and johto regions
pokemon,not_removed,im behind this ive wanted a region with an african setting for years now if i could get a gorilla grass starter id be set from the beginning
pokemon,not_removed,i think making the entire continent one region is sorta a bad idea it should focus on one country i think having one europe region or asia region is bad and ill say the same for africa theres so many different cultures religions environments and urban landscapes across the continent that i feel like smashing them all into one continent is just killing a lot of oppurtunities
pokemon,not_removed,i can definately see pokemon like girafarig donphan and hippowdon getting regional forms here
pokemon,not_removed,hmmmm lets see i can see some regional variants but id rather see a whole load of new pokemon starters could be a grass rock elephant water electric crocodile fire poison snake or something not sure id like to see some unique typing in the next gen thats for sure i could see a whole lot of fire ground or grass pokemon in an african based game hopefully some really viable grass pokemon will come out of this
pokemon,not_removed,this sounds really cool id love a region with a big uninhabited rainforest with a very small chance of finding wild mews
pokemon,not_removed,africa would be good it has a lot of different environments id also love a region based on latin america
pokemon,not_removed,i think africa as a whole is too big for a region but a portion of the continent could work a region that kinda follows the path of the nile that goes east to the coast and west to the rainforests encompassing egypt sudan south sudan ethiopia somalia kenya uganda tanzania and parts of the central african republic and the democratic republic of congo could work that captures most of the biomes in africa and a decent amount of the cultures and history postgame routes could potentially go from cairo to timbuktu if we want the history from the mali empire to make it into the region too
pokemon,not_removed,all the pokemon suffer from a really aggressive strain of pokérus
pokemon,not_removed,a whole continent are they shrinking it down or just having a huge map with like cities and gyms i dont think this fits in with the previous gens which have focus on areas so much smaller
pokemon,not_removed,honestly id loved this idea they could use kenya and the surrounding area
pokemon,not_removed,of course itd be fun to see a whole region based on an area that hasnt really been done before like somewhere in africa or south america etc but i still want to see a canadianthemed region it could be just like unova but cleaner and friendlier and instead of having to go to game stop for events they could just print codes on tim hortons cups p
pokemon,not_removed,so lots of parasitic pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,i want a honey badger pokemon they are native to africa and it would be awesome
pokemon,not_removed,i think next one will be a cold place either europe or an unused japan region like it they use the nortern part south of hokkaido it can connect to sinnoh remakes and kanto postgame so they can bring it back without reremakes and make a proper rendition of tokyo
pokemon,not_removed,if the pikaclone isnt a jerboa i will be disappointed
pokemon,not_removed,im totally on board with this several regions in africa are so different from regions in other games i think the two best things about the idea are the difference in culture since this would be on a new continent again and africa is famous for being a hotbed of life theres dozens of biomes and in turn thousands of specie differences plus who doesnt want a to hear a african tribal version of the pokemon theme ah sooo much culture
pokemon,not_removed,no more trials pls
pokemon,not_removed,this could be rather interesting as an area to work on however based on the current state of the world regarding some african nations im unsure if it will happen anytime soon there is tons that could work for this and perhaps we could play on the concept that africa is the cradle of life and have it make mew plot relevant and catachable in game as it is the ancestor of all pokemon or even a variant hakuna mew if the region was called hakuna i certainly think variants should be a thing in future generations and i think africa could be an interesting one because of the variety the variants could make old favourites a bit different but more viable a donphan variant who perhaps uses water based attacks and has whip like attack using the trunk be fairly interesting it it could use its trunk like a vine to some extent and learn vine whip despite not being a grass type we could have this be the origins of pyroar and perhaps have it more powerful here or perhaps it doesnt have its fire typing and only gained that in other regions to maintain the heat from its native land wed definitely have to bring in the pokemon based on african animals ie lions zebras giraffes we could also have maybe a variant of grumpig who evolves into a more physical attack a warthog rather than the psychic type a rhino and ostrich pokemon would also be interesting totally would call my rhino rambi i wonder could you have all three starters as bulky animals eg rhino elephant hippo rhino as fire they seem more prone to temper and temper is normally associated with heat elephant for grass and its trunk is stretchable like a vine hippo for water or even go really random and have hippo for grass and elephant for water it would also be interesting if the elephant had a water attack that could cause confusion but as elephants ferment stuff in their trunk to create alcohol
pokemon,not_removed,not a bad idea heres my thoughts grass starter grass monkey grassrock chimp grasssteel gorilla the base form holds a wooden club the second form holds a stoneheaded axe the final form holds a httpsenwikipediaorgwikikhopesh fire starter fire rhino calf firerock onehorned rhino firedragon twohorned rhino the base form is a fairly simple rhinoceros design with only a stub of horn and fire around its ankles the second form grows a great deal and gains a flaming horn and rocky plating around all of its joints the last form gains a second flaming horn and designs of tribal masks on its flanks water starter water hippo calf waterground hippo waterfairy hippo the first form is a simple stylized blue hippo calf the second form grows a great deal and begins to gain stylized tribal mask symbols on its sides the final form gains tiny wings and long whiskers it forms a doubleddown weakness triangle encouraging a diverse team in the main game however it also gives some rare types right off the bat filling many niches for the party that most players will go through the main game with
pokemon,not_removed,i always wanted a spanish pokémon gen but thatd be fun too
pokemon,not_removed,personally as an arab muslim i demand an arabbased region if you want egypt fine but we must have it oasis towns in the middle of a desert where ground or few rare types of grass types exist think emirates or sahara cacti you know or towns by rivers where water types exist think the nile or mountainous regions where rock types or electric types exist like the lebanese or iraqi mountainsides heck there could be a small landlocked sea like the dead sea and really make it an interesting region pretty please
pokemon,not_removed,grass starter could be a lion that uses its plumagemane to hide in plain sight im thinking like tropiusvenasaurmeganium
pokemon,not_removed,i have a mighty need
pokemon,not_removed,i would love it i guess the question is what region egypt and northern africa and maybe a smidge of central africa too
pokemon,not_removed,can we get those hummingbirds and dolphins weve been asking for
pokemon,not_removed,secretary bird pokemon or riot if this happens
pokemon,not_removed,ive actually been thinking up a pokemon game in my head which has all of africa as a region and maybe someday i could get someone to program it i have like mons already
pokemon,not_removed,dont kid yourself you know the fire cobra starters gonna grow two legs and start walking
pokemon,not_removed,httppgenvpwikiacomwikiebolable
pokemon,not_removed,i think this would be a great next step for the franchise you would have to bring back the safari zone
pokemon,not_removed,i think it wouldnt work for gen viii alola was a naturaol region with civilization only just having settled in and africa would be too similar it would look gorgeous on the switch though
pokemon,not_removed,duel type its actually dual type duel type would mean fighting type dual type means types
pokemon,not_removed,im just waititng for the australia region
pokemon,not_removed,yeah it would be outright stupid for them to leave out pokemon based on popular real world animals that live across africa shoot we can new regional variants as well lets say a girafarig from here will be much taller like a real giraffe and would likely be normaldragon or dragonpsychic reference to how some countries think giraffes resembled dragons donphan can also get a regional form that makes it large maybe hippowdon becomes waterground
pokemon,not_removed,plus every old world monkey pokemon sans infernape line
pokemon,not_removed,well since they didnt put bellossom sunflora solrock and lunatone in sun and moon i wouldnt get your hopes up
pokemon,not_removed,yeah id like it if they go gen with and bring back older pokemon and give them another evolution maybe the explanation could be that since they are in their natural habitat they can evolve further than normal
pokemon,not_removed,hopefully given regional variants african forms as well
pokemon,not_removed,also ryhorn
pokemon,not_removed,i also see this place as a perfect opportunity for pokemon to walk behind you
pokemon,not_removed,great place to inject social commentary of the ongoing ivory poaching
pokemon,not_removed,a gorilla would be great never thought of that
pokemon,not_removed,why grass come on we dont have enough firefighting type starters yet seriously though i would love it if we got a water fighting or grass psychic gorilla
pokemon,not_removed,make it madagascar and just have everything be lemurs
pokemon,not_removed,that would be the idea maybe even some new evolutions
pokemon,not_removed,waterelectric would be a pretty cool typing but we already have a water crocodilealligator starter p
pokemon,not_removed,grass elephant elephants arent extinct yet
pokemon,not_removed,we just had a reptilian firepoison not a starter but it would make salazzle completely useless water electric is a little weird dont you think
pokemon,not_removed,mew comes from south america
pokemon,not_removed,mew is only distributed through events for a reason its the head person at game freaks favorite im not so sure about wild mews
pokemon,not_removed,or south america you have all sorts of biomes and a whole area that is the land of fire you also have the andes the amazon rio the horn hell you could add a land of ice to cover the tip of argentina and the fawklands
pokemon,not_removed,the lake victoria analogue would make the sinnoh lakes look insignificant
pokemon,not_removed,the original post was talking about having it based thematically on cultures and animals from the african continent they were not implying that it would literally be a continentsized overworld map
pokemon,not_removed,kalos was based off france kalos was quite obviously not as big as france theyll do the same thing here
pokemon,not_removed,what if the villain team think that the ex champion of unova comes from said region
pokemon,not_removed,move over roll up the rim we have a new cup game in town
pokemon,not_removed,i kinda like that but would love it if instead of something like pokémon contests there was a pokémon hockey event thing pockéy and was a side focus of the anime
pokemon,not_removed,parasites exist everywhere
pokemon,not_removed,it could be the rattata of the region
pokemon,not_removed,typhlosion
pokemon,not_removed,had to actually look that up that doesnt even need a pokémon form it already looks like one
pokemon,not_removed,id worry that the water and fire starters would look too similar other than that im on board
pokemon,not_removed,this isnt a bad idea except im willing to bet gf will never make a dragon starter without mega evolutions ofc
pokemon,not_removed,water starter gets shafted no supereffective hits with stab on final fire form fire dragon resists both stabs making it only but it is hit by grass still grass steel is also fire typings that cover each other well that we havent seen a lot would be grassfairywaterfightingfiresteel ik theres keldeo and heatran that cover the last two well but im sure we could carve a niche or give special moves to the starters to give them something
pokemon,not_removed,gorowla gorillagrowlgrow for the grass gorilla
pokemon,not_removed,please ive wanted a dolphin mon for so long
pokemon,not_removed,lets say a girafarig from here will be much taller like a real giraffe is that really what you want more lankymeme pokemon because im all for it
pokemon,not_removed,rip bellossom in alola
pokemon,not_removed,but only through scanning qr codes a day edit sorry but i was a little upset that just to have a chance at an old starter i needed to scan so many qr codes
pokemon,not_removed,gen did that not gen
pokemon,not_removed,also the perfect opportunity to give many of the pokémon that appeared in the safari addition evolutions and to give nidoqueen and nidoqueen mega evos
pokemon,not_removed,grassfighting kong
pokemon,not_removed,gorowla gorillagrowgrowl
pokemon,not_removed,gorowla gorillagrowgrowl
pokemon,not_removed,grass psychic gorilla please give me grodd
pokemon,not_removed,orangurupassimian confirmed
pokemon,not_removed,i think the southern tip of africa madagascar and mauritius because dodos would make a solid region
pokemon,not_removed,we dont need more fire types but id love to see more ground steel and fairies
pokemon,not_removed,grass mammoth
pokemon,not_removed,give it time
pokemon,not_removed,chinchou and lanturn are the only waterelectric we have i think a new one wouldnt hurt especially since it would have better stats
pokemon,not_removed,which has lots of rainforest in it p that was my logic
pokemon,not_removed,lets have a game there not based on south america in south america
pokemon,not_removed,how about lesser mews like ones with a bst instead of but the same movepool shenanigans
pokemon,not_removed,its something id like id like for lots of things to happen like being able to jump feet in the air or being able to speak a languages it probably wont happen but it cant stop me from wanting it to happen
pokemon,not_removed,right but even so that might be a little hard to capture as a consequence of africa being a huge continent with multiple countries theres also a lot of cultural variation i think a game based on africa would be better served focusing on one particular country cultural region
pokemon,not_removed,the switch might be able to have an entire continent with the larger cartridge size
pokemon,not_removed,true but its a huge leap in size a quick google tells me africa is times the size of france i thought it was more damn france is big that jump is equivalent to having the unova region based on nyc and then having a region based on the whole of the usa
pokemon,not_removed,but france is way smaller and they still left the south part of it
pokemon,not_removed,yo noice
pokemon,not_removed,it isnt a coincidence that in parasitology the majority of clinical cases start or develop in africa
pokemon,not_removed,so long as it doesnt suck like rattata im all for it
pokemon,not_removed,i guess typhlosion is based on a badger but i want something more along the lines of a fighting or dark type because they never give up and are tireless in combat they also fight dirty by targeting the opponents soft parts like eyes nose genitals they have been know to castrate larger opponents
pokemon,not_removed,i actually thought about that and considered making the water starter an elephant buuuut ¯ツ¯ edit ill do it here why not water starter water elephant calf waterrock elephant waterfairy elephant the base form is a bright blue elephant calf with overlarge ears the second form becomes somewhat encased in stone resembling a cocoon with some tribal markings the final form breaks this cocoon with tusks changing from rock to a glowing pink small wings on its back and pink tribal markings all over its body
pokemon,not_removed,in other words a gang that totally wants to take over the region not sure about the starter point though it might be seen as a little offensive
pokemon,not_removed,i mean someone will harvest lots of fake internet points it could even be me
pokemon,not_removed,i want it to evolve
pokemon,not_removed,this is what i want
pokemon,not_removed,more lankymeme pokemon he
pokemon,not_removed,doesnt everyone want that
pokemon,not_removed,elephants in real life have actually evolved to have no tusks in response to ivory hunters we could make a regional form out of donphan it doesnt get the fang or horn moves that regular donphan has but it can use its long trunk as a whip or to fire ranged attacks just throwing ideas out there
pokemon,not_removed,its even more bizarre and dumb when you find out you need one or the other for an endgame event in the desert
pokemon,not_removed,yeah the oddish family no being in alola was justweird as im sure most of us immediately associated bellossom with hawaii
pokemon,not_removed,you can seriously go on google images search for qr codes and then scan them
pokemon,not_removed,my bad felt like gen had a moment of weakness
pokemon,not_removed,ah yes both nidoqueen and nidoqueen i like your train of thought
pokemon,not_removed,i really hope they have some awesome new mega evos a lot of pokémon including gen really need them
pokemon,not_removed,i think grassrock would be good we havent had any rock starter afaik and it could have some interesting designs
pokemon,not_removed,i for one could go for a break from fighting starters weve had one in every gen since hoenn
pokemon,not_removed,i am so sick of fighting type
pokemon,not_removed,be still my heart
pokemon,not_removed,and then it goes down instantly if a bug looks at it in a funny way
pokemon,not_removed,i wholeheartedly agree
pokemon,not_removed,isnt passimian a monkey and oranguru is a great ape
pokemon,not_removed,definitely need a dodo pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,a mamoss
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,rotomw is the only other one that comes to mind
pokemon,not_removed,if it was a starter it wouldnt be as good as something like metagross or salazzle which both have unique typings and are viable for competitive
pokemon,not_removed,please
pokemon,not_removed,we could have a regional form of beedrill killer bees were the result of some guy in brazil crossbreeding honeybees with african wasps we could say our beedrill is the africanized honeybee and there is another form of beedrill that conservationists are trying to protect
pokemon,not_removed,mewthree
pokemon,not_removed,i wish i could give you gold for this comment id like to have a pc box full of mews as well but it wouldnt make logical sense
pokemon,not_removed,completely agreed i was only responding to interpretation of the ops statement of based on the african continent to mean the size of a continent which clearly was never the intent
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think gf has the resources to tackle the culture nuance required to make a region out of a portion of africa
pokemon,not_removed,they could easily split the continent into two regions one north of the sahara and one south of it then just shrink the map to make the routes and cities fit while still maintaining the right map shape and cityroute balance the other games have both regions could be in the same generation even the southofthesahara region would be unlocked after the events of the northofthesahara region allow travel through whatever the pokemon world equivalent to the sahara is maybe its a raging sandstorm that no one can get through until the legendaries of the northern region are calmed or something
pokemon,not_removed,it isnt so much a problem of the hardware not supporting a continent since it would only ever have to display small chunks of it at any time rather theres only so large of a game world that game freak can populate with detailed characters and content within the development cycle of a single game interesting game locations take time to design and build
pokemon,not_removed,africa is also way more culturally and geographically diverse than just france
pokemon,not_removed,fine gen uses the sahara and some of subsaharan africa then gen uses the rest of africa
pokemon,not_removed,id say keep it waterrock or make it waterpsychic a second waterfairy might run the risk of becoming the next firefighting lol
pokemon,not_removed,has
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure evolution does not happen that fast it takes like millions of years for evolution of that scale to take effect
pokemon,not_removed,im not sure if it could be associated with something else either and its one of my fave pokes so i was quite sad
pokemon,not_removed,and you can reuse any qr codes httpmimgurcomaefoqs
pokemon,not_removed,its annoying
pokemon,not_removed,its cool but i agree id love to have another generation where old pokemon are given a new purpose
pokemon,not_removed,nidoqueen x and y d
pokemon,not_removed,nidoking should become poisondragon while nidoqueen stays poisonground maybe poisonfairy or something like that
pokemon,not_removed,not alola
pokemon,not_removed,i have a feeling this comment was a joke since you know tepig flair but then again i usually have trouble detecting jokes too
pokemon,not_removed,blue beetle confirmed to be grodds kryptonite
pokemon,not_removed,passimian looks like a lemur to me and oranguru is an orangutan
pokemon,not_removed,oh my god i want this
pokemon,not_removed,beedrill is far more like the including its massive needlelike stinger and violent temper but they could still have a variant of beedrill thats more like a proper bee
pokemon,not_removed,if mewtwo is a better nmew then a worse one would be mewzero
pokemon,not_removed,thats awfully kind dude one can dream
pokemon,not_removed,saharan africa is fairly similar in culture and really not even that big of a livable area because most of it is just desert south of the sahara has diversity and different cultures for decades honestly makes no sense to group all of subsaharan africa into one place when nyc is a whole region or to have it as an equivalent of saharan africa
pokemon,not_removed,that could work i was going to suggest something like the islands of alola to distinguish different regions but i wasnt sure if the mechanics would make sense your idea sounds better
pokemon,not_removed,the cartridges couldnt contain it game freak could do it and you know it it would take longer to develop we might have or years from the time sun and moon released but if we get an amazing game im okay with waiting take a look at zelda botw the game is a huge adventure that took years and years of fans buying lazy rereleases to finally come out
pokemon,not_removed,style
pokemon,not_removed,its more like that elephants that have larger tusks are killed so over time their overall size has dropped in the past few hundred years
pokemon,not_removed,but then they lose their sheer forcelife orb shenanigans which are ridiculously fun
pokemon,not_removed,orangutans are great apes and apparently passimian is a httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiblackandwhiteruffedlemur
pokemon,not_removed,good point
pokemon,not_removed,one can hack as well
pokemon,not_removed,he
pokemon,not_removed,and
pokemon,not_removed,give nideoqueen water compaction or maybe thick fat and nidoking keeps sheer force nidoqueem gets defensive increases and nidoking gets offensive
pokemon,not_removed,nonmobile link httpsenwikipediaorgwikiblackandwhiteruffedlemur helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
pokemon,not_removed,indeed but i think if youre doing that just for a single player adventure its a little sad
pokemon,not_removed,unless nidoking got a massive spa boost it would still be better for him to keep life orb not dissimilar the situation with blazikenalakazam and their megas
pokemon,not_removed,im sad because i want the most out of my games
pokemon,not_removed,sweet hopefully this means we can get some of the other apricorn balls this way on the future i really love the look of a lure ball
pokemon,not_removed,now if everyone just trades yungoos for any level thatd be great
pokemon,not_removed,now what needs to happen is that every trades gives you a rare candy wouldnt that be kind
pokemon,not_removed,would you say you are fond of the allure of a lure ball
pokemon,not_removed,seems like the strategy is a magnemite chain see the stickied post for details
pokemon,not_removed,i really want a decent post game give me a reason to visit anywhere besides the day care and battle tree after completing the story let me rematch trainers once a day and give them pokemon that can put up a decent fight so i dont just one hit ko everyone visiting of aloha is pointless after completing the game i would love to be able to revisit routes whilst still having something to do on them that gives me meaningful experience
pokemon,not_removed,id love it if choices made in the game changed the gameplay not like good endings or bad endings but like you can either tell your rival to check another room and they have their pokemon stolen and you have to find them or you tell them to stay and you do something else
pokemon,not_removed,instead of a solid just make it an animeesque field tournament randomly generated and scaled to your team so some are higherlowerequal through the first play through you happen to meet people who will eventually become the favorites along with yourself to win after that everything is randomly generated and whatnot keep you on your toes
pokemon,not_removed,yupp sounds promising i mean your right its basically nothing to do after the story
pokemon,not_removed,that would be awesome
pokemon,not_removed,great idea man
pokemon,not_removed,i always loved togepi in the anime tooki tooki trrrrrrroi is the happiest sound i know
pokemon,not_removed,wow you spelled that out perfectly
pokemon,not_removed,lets put one of those beefy arms back on him for good measure
pokemon,not_removed,finally someone that keeps the original cartoonish design but makes it better all of the fanarts are a costant look at this overtuned dragon did you know it was charizard i bet you didnt but look at the title
pokemon,not_removed,httpsaduideviantartcom
pokemon,not_removed,has a definite dragonriders of pern flavor
pokemon,not_removed,i wish he was a little less shiny but otherwise i love it
pokemon,not_removed,trogdore
pokemon,not_removed,i dont see why graveler and meowth types would change even though on gen theyre not that
pokemon,not_removed,i guess they could have given a second type to blastoise maybe steel
pokemon,not_removed,giovannis a groundtype specialist because hes materialistic hes obsessed with worldly possessions aka things of the earth
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know i feel like if they intended to implement these changes they would have done them already
pokemon,not_removed,i dont have a problem with that im just wondering why crobat isnt dark flying type since he was added in gen
pokemon,not_removed,idk i could see meowth being part dark since from the start the meowth we know is a bad guy and in japanese dark type is literally evil type plus all of the other meowth we seeexcept one regularly turn to stealing and the persian we see that isnt with giovanni is basically a mob boss i feel like they wouldnt change it once dark type was a thing though because meowth was already really iconic and itd sorta be like changing pikachus type its just something youd never do
pokemon,not_removed,because gf would have to work with the pokemon they have its a hypothetical discussion lol
pokemon,not_removed,trueee
pokemon,not_removed,i wished mega blastoise was watersteel
pokemon,not_removed,eh maybe i mean its obvious that the lake trio should have been given the fairy type in gen they are fairies after all and yet gamefreak determined to not alter any legendary pokemon that tells us that they draw the line somewhere with regards to retcons i fully believe that had steel existed in rby blastoise would have had it as a secondary type but its a starter final evolution perhaps in the same tier of dont retcon me as legendary pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,all the other starters get a second type
pokemon,not_removed,haha well then blastoise would have definitely been watersteel
pokemon,not_removed,i had so much fun with this one especially since it has no crazy bits like ampharos hair once i had the crest built i hit maximum inspiration and the rest came pretty quickly im much happier with how this one turned out compared to ampharos and yveltal any requests for
pokemon,not_removed,whatever you do dont use stomp on it
pokemon,not_removed,you forgot the form
pokemon,not_removed,nice work must have missed the ampharos but that is an excellent render
pokemon,not_removed,this is epic
pokemon,not_removed,if you do torterra and luxray then i can die happy
pokemon,not_removed,obviously xerneas to complete the kalos trio
pokemon,not_removed,you should do flygon
pokemon,not_removed,i would love to see diancie or meloetta
pokemon,not_removed,hooh perhaps
pokemon,not_removed,alakazam
pokemon,not_removed,you said you were going to do vileplume or volcarona its up to you to choose this is my favorite lego pokemon rendition youve made so far id like to see volcanion but i dont know if the curves are possible perhaps gengar
pokemon,not_removed,which one would hurt more using stomp on a lego zygarde or lego xerneas
pokemon,not_removed,now let us never speak of this image again edit although in all seriousness flygon would be fun to try properly
pokemon,not_removed,definitely the xerneas its antlers would give more points to step on
pokemon,not_removed,this image
pokemon,not_removed,source
pokemon,not_removed,we russians celebrate new years eve the same way you celebrate christmas with fanfare friends feasting and ded moroz coming to deliver gifts to the good little boys and girls so actually youre just in time
pokemon,not_removed,happy new year
pokemon,not_removed,for anyone who was stumped like me mitm is malcolm in the middle and the main characters parents are named lois and hal
pokemon,not_removed,very cute love the shading and detail keep drawing man
pokemon,not_removed,yes i am just playing it through both editions for the fourth time when i have gotten a decent team ill prob do more online i didnt like sun at all so same here
pokemon,not_removed,awesome
pokemon,not_removed,rounding out the evolutionary line well at least the nonmegas regardless one of my favorites and always good to see
pokemon,not_removed,gallade is the name of the pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,nice work gallades my favorite pokémon but ive always hated how his legs just looked like stumps i really like your interpretation
pokemon,not_removed,i for some reason thought this was drew a gallade
pokemon,not_removed,gallade are generation pokémon that evolve from male kirlia using a dawn stone
pokemon,not_removed,oh thats his english name as im french i know him as gallame
pokemon,not_removed,the english is a portmanteau of gallant and blade is the french name similar in origin
pokemon,not_removed,its also a reference to balladsballades alternatively galahad a knight of the round table
pokemon,not_removed,gallant must be translated as galant and blade is translated as lame so yes
pokemon,not_removed,this post is a bit of a mess are you talking about gobecause you mentioned the pester ball and thats in snap
pokemon,not_removed,includes camel toe
pokemon,not_removed,oooo good find i love when they mess up
pokemon,not_removed,lol
pokemon,not_removed,huh when did they give sableye zoroarks ability
pokemon,not_removed,no its either a poor bootleg or an error
pokemon,not_removed,yes i know it was a joke i found this at a meijer where they had appropriately labeled new hawlucha and mega sableye toys but it looks like quality control looked away during production for a few seconds i thought maybe it might have been a return but it was still factory sealed i like collecting errorbootleg stuff though so this was a neat find
pokemon,not_removed,shoutout to meijer
pokemon,not_removed,thank god i thought is was a joke but this hawlucha looks nothing like a sabelye
pokemon,not_removed,i dont see anything wrong with it
pokemon,not_removed,yes lunaala is cropped and looks very pushed to the right edge while solgaleo is smaller but has bolder linework and leaves much room to the sides i dont know the design looks sloppy and lazy not at all what id expect from a main series pokémon the new monster hunter is a good example of quality design
pokemon,not_removed,whats wrong about this again
pokemon,not_removed,this id prefer one on the front and one on the back fully showing off each poke to its maximum potential
pokemon,not_removed,just seems off and out of proportion to me id prefer one on the front and one on the back both at the centre of each panel
pokemon,not_removed,hmm yeah looking closer it seems a bit out of order with lunala just crammed up in there but it may be just the image creating an optical deformity
pokemon,not_removed,gengar would be a surprise the others not so much
pokemon,not_removed,i mean thats some of the pokemon he had uh dont know if he had a gengar though
pokemon,not_removed,no i feel like the movie is going to be a continuation of a few episodes from the original series i think each pokemon indicates a specific episode or segment of the movie catching bulbasaur charmander getting abandoned the gengar in the haunted tower etc
pokemon,not_removed,he had a haunter once which stayed with sabrina
pokemon,not_removed,oh god does that mean we will relive the butterfree leaving scene in modern video quality
pokemon,not_removed,depends on how you define it since they just chilled and he never actually caught it
pokemon,not_removed,i really dont understand why people love treecko he has more attention than torchic or mudkip
pokemon,not_removed,i love torchic
pokemon,not_removed,tfw ash greninja doesnt get cut
pokemon,not_removed,they shouldve applied the leech life change to cut too it wouldve been hilarious
pokemon,not_removed,at least he can catch fire
pokemon,not_removed,honedge family
pokemon,not_removed,thats so bs how does a water pokemon die to blast burn
pokemon,not_removed,i dont get why people question this logic but not when mega septile got rekt by water shuryken
pokemon,not_removed,its zblast burn
pokemon,not_removed,not very effective does not mean no damage taking a super strong move and cutting it in half is still good damage
pokemon,not_removed,tagged
pokemon,not_removed,i noticed
pokemon,not_removed,hahha ur gay
pokemon,not_removed,youre already doing a genesect could i see the end result if you dont mind
pokemon,not_removed,i have a question are you gonna continue with last weeks queue or are you starting from scratch
pokemon,not_removed,of course i upload them here publicly
pokemon,not_removed,i am going to finish last weeks
pokemon,not_removed,yours and a couple others i am having trouble recreating but i am going to see it through
pokemon,not_removed,aw thats awesome i could totally see a scaledup version with a few boulders and rocks drawn in as a cool desktop background c
pokemon,not_removed,good job
pokemon,not_removed,awesome c yeah keep me posted id love to see it if you get around to it
pokemon,not_removed,heres what goes down in the gts good trade taken good trade taken bad trade good trade taken bad trade as you can see the good trades are all taken and the bad trades go to the back you would have a better chance depositing instead of searching
pokemon,not_removed,you can choose to not include special pokemon when you search
pokemon,not_removed,i like how some people ask for something reasonable like litten or rowlett but requirement level or higher like seriously
pokemon,not_removed,deleted
pokemon,not_removed,gts is fine and does what its supposed to there are options to filter out legendaries pokemon from copies in your language and also filter out pokemon that are asking for things you dont have the only thing that needs to happen is allowing you to view a pokemons summary in gts a good quality of life change is to allow searching for items but its not necessary as that isnt the purpose of the gts
pokemon,not_removed,itd be nice to see gftpcinintendo release some stats on trades because i am largely sure the gts is fine the problem is rather simple and unfortunately fundamental good trades get completed bad trades dont bad trades therefore dont disappear leaving lists looking like everyone is asking for dumb stuff because the fair trades obviously get completed nearly immediately they could put a time limit on removing bad trades but why bother the good trades would be gone just as quickly and its doubtful more people would actually ask for fair ones if they wanted what was fair theyd be making those trades already the gts has always been a sellers market you typically have better luck depositing and asking for fair trades than you do searching for one exceptions are as has been noted around when something odd happens to availability like it does with starters too many people pick one so its rare that people want one from the gts i still got the other starters through depositing with rowlett but it did take a day or two or even three to get both of the others exclusive trades or exchanging trade evolutions have always gone through very quickly for me this gen ive even got quick trades from what i assume are kind people since they dont really benefit from it of a full evolved pokemon for my preevolution form holding the trade evolving item again the person trading me the evolution gets no real benefit from doing so since they already have the evolved form its going to evolve to when they get the trade and either already had the preevolution or could easily get one without having to trade only i benefit from such trade but they go through quickly anyway there are plenty of people depositing fair trades and searching for fair trades they just go quickly and become invisible to everyone else leaving the chaff behind
pokemon,not_removed,last gen trades were pretty bad this gen is just absolutely terrible im not sure if it has to do with the fact that tons of people bought sunmoon including people who havent played before and little kids but its the worst ive seen it its a shame too i wish more people could be at least a little bit more reasonable when it comes to trades
pokemon,not_removed,on the flipside after evolvingtrading intotrading into and evolving stuff like a dragonite and rampardos i or them up on the gts for type null cosmog and the tapus for a living dex i now have type nulls cosmogs and tapus and none of them are actually from my game
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know it is bad to see all these trades for legends and ubs but at least i could actually trade those pokemon if i had them unlike the mountain of mythicals i would happily trade for stuff in gen
pokemon,not_removed,because rowlet is the most popular starter its harder to get a trade for a popplio or a litten since less people chose this chespin was the golden starter last gen since it was the least popular while froakie was overbred to death this gen it seems to be litten thats the golden goose
pokemon,not_removed,gts in a nutshell but there are some smart people who know how to make decent trades
pokemon,not_removed,its a sellers depositors market my god people just give everything to you for anything right now im just depositing archen i got weavile scisor politoed slowking and more it makes me feel guilty so at least i give all of my outgoing archen pokerus now also man people love their shiny oricorio eh ive gotten a solgaleo and a cosmoem when i put them up i use oricorio for ev grinding and i inevitably come across shinies in the middle of my grind
pokemon,not_removed,i dunno i never found reasonable trades on the gts but never had trouble on posted trades
pokemon,not_removed,yeah searching for trades is almost impossible just try depositing i managed to get kartana for a mandibuzz i deposited which i never would have been able to do sifting through what people were asking for it
pokemon,not_removed,i snagged a litten for bewear earlier today
pokemon,not_removed,ive had a volpix in there for a while now after a sandshrew no one wants it at least thats not happening to you
pokemon,not_removed,i recommend wondertrade quite a bit ive only done about an hour or two of it but i managed to snag a litten rowlets and popplios out of lets say trades so thats worth a look seriously though you can get things to trade things for ive got about beast ball beldums off of wt so if you breed and use them for completing the dex youre golden i put one up for dhelmise and it got traded very quickly
pokemon,not_removed,i wish you could search by what people are looking for so you could see everyone whos looking for the pokemon you want to trade and see what you can get in return
pokemon,not_removed,then i managed to find a vulpix with freeze dry moonblast and its hidden ability for an arquanid which hadnt disappeared by the time id managed to complete the trade note i was just looking for any vulpix to complete the dex entry when i checked its status i was very surprised
pokemon,not_removed,game freak should begin cracking down on these they should regulate trading guide and say if its fair for you needing to give out a high levelled legendary not vice versa as maybe someone might want to get a low levelled and want to make sure they do but just make sure there cant be cheap trades
pokemon,not_removed,yes
pokemon,not_removed,i would just deposit one for what you want i got a litten for a rowlet in about an hour
pokemon,not_removed,your best bet is to deposit your pokemon to get the ones that you want
pokemon,not_removed,just filter out the legendary and mythical pokemon and youll find the good trades its really not that hard
pokemon,not_removed,ive only deposited a crabrawler for a rowlet
pokemon,not_removed,despite these seeming unfair a lot of people are cool with trading ubslegends for region exclsuives or starters ive been trading vullabys for stuff like kartana solgaleo and nihilego
pokemon,not_removed,if you still need one i can send you over a popplio just pm me your friend code and ill get an egg started
pokemon,not_removed,i got my extra starters with feebas breeding
pokemon,not_removed,just catch a semi rare gen pokémon in a premierapricorn ball breed more and voila you can get next to anything in less than minutes on gts thanks to premier ball turtonater i filled my pokedex and have like tons of ultra beasts the only difficult pokémon to get are porygonz and weavile but i got lucky with weavile
pokemon,not_removed,you should be able to make counter offers or trade multiple pokemon at a time
pokemon,not_removed,i know what you meani have had a litten up for a day now expecting it to be instant so bad
pokemon,not_removed,think thats bad try getting a delibird off gts the first or so are all requesting totodile and theyve all got weird nicknames i assume theyre ingame names or some shit edit i just need vanilites line to finish my dex now what do people on the gts want kingdra kingdra scizor or kingdra
pokemon,not_removed,seriously just wonder trade ive gotten like of each starters from just wonder trading
pokemon,not_removed,ive gotten typenulls from the gts one for a sableye and another for a garchomp i got them by repeatedly searching for a type null on the gts
pokemon,not_removed,without a doubt just the other day i was trying to find a jangmoo for my team before the fourth island and whenever i found i trade i could do it was already taken i only got one because i had a spare female salandit to trade
pokemon,not_removed,youre going about it wrong deposit and ask for what youre looking for theres thousands of people out there looking for reasonable trades and will snatch your trade up instantly
pokemon,not_removed,gts in the old games was much more reasonable i had an oranguru for a turtnator deposited no other requirements and i didnt get a trade in a month in xyoras i can get legendaries by depositing baby pokemon basically any possible trade eventually gets a recipient i think theyve made a big mistake in placing online activities in the plaza that extra loading time and menu steps will reduce its use much more than youd think
pokemon,not_removed,its like people think the beginning of last gens gts was amazing
pokemon,not_removed,if you put up your pokemon for what you want you can usually get it with minutes if youre asking for an even remotely fair trade
pokemon,not_removed,whats even worse is that when they ask for a pokémon thats easy enough to get they always ask for it to be over level
pokemon,not_removed,meh i traded a toxapex for a celesteela
pokemon,not_removed,gts is literally cancer i want to get a skrelp to make an awesome acid armor goodra but literally the only shit left are people wanting uber tier legendaries its fucking nonsense i dont have a copy of x or y and i dont have omega ruby so gts is pretty much all i can do
pokemon,not_removed,thats what i did i just found a person wanting a rowlet for a litten and it got sniped
pokemon,not_removed,i think you forgot good trade bad nickname
pokemon,not_removed,its all down to luck in the end i managed to get a shiny breeding ditto for a brionne after hours of trying you must have a box ready with every pokémon in the alola region ready to be traded and make a special trade box with rare hard to obtain pokémon ready for trades like apricorn ball starters celesteela or lunala any tapu or a cool pokémon overall if not you can always feed a chanseygolbatriolumunchlaxpichuetc with pomeg kelpsy qualot or any other frienship berry make them evolve and slap a big nugget to them for almost any good trade
pokemon,not_removed,its still mindblowing how many unfair trades there are on the gts
pokemon,not_removed,thats how i finally got celesteela trading ultra beasts didnt work and i found someone that wanted a level mimikyu it was worth it to finally complete my dex
pokemon,not_removed,i bred my litten to trade for all starters and found i had to wait about a day to get a rowlet so hang in there op
pokemon,not_removed,i deposited a rowlet for a popplio atleast minutes ago
pokemon,not_removed,you should be able to search for any statistic of a pokémon that is normally visible on the status screen and not just by what you want but by what the other player wants as for items the gts is for getting pokémon you wantneed some of those pokémon require items if youre to end up with them when all is said and done if you cant search for items specifically which you should as it appears on the status screen and could make someone want to trade with you more if youve got something on there they want regardless of whether or not they want the species then they should at least treat trade item evolvers as their evolved species whether youre searching or depositing for one you know like if you or someone else was asking for politoed both politoed and poliwhirl holding a kings rock should be allowed to go through though this should happen either way there is zero reason not to provide options when theyre possible and these thing are most definitely possible more options more players stick around they have a larger player base they make more money what they want to not provide options is never the better idea if you want more players sure you can make changes but that just gives you different players when you alienate players who liked it as it was not more players
pokemon,not_removed,i think it has mostly likely to do with the fact that sunmoon sold a lot of copies
pokemon,not_removed,yeah the last generations gts was bad and so is this one but i find it funny how i managed to get myself a shiny dialga and palkia in omega ruby on the gts just by putting up normal ones i know thatll never happen again in sun or moon thats for sure
pokemon,not_removed,yeah its crazy what people still want to trade for these psedo legendarys that are hard to train
pokemon,not_removed,luckily i have it but not popplio
pokemon,not_removed,i deposited a rowlet in the gts for a litten i hope someone answers it soon
pokemon,not_removed,its all about playing the game right what pokemon do you see commonly asked for weaviles easy to get if you put the work in lucario can be made in batches of with poke pelago ive gotten zygardes from lucario and a few porygonz from weaviles
pokemon,not_removed,i think i deposited a rowlet for a litten atleast minutes ago
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think tradingputting up a few pokemon at a time is a good idea it will just encourage people to put up shit trades
pokemon,not_removed,that sounds like people putting up pokemon during a giveaway probably a streamer giving away pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,put up magiccarp holding beast ball
pokemon,not_removed,apricorn starters are unobtainable legit if its the alolan rowletlittenpopplio
pokemon,not_removed,however unfair they may be these trades do go through sometimes i managed to get myself a pheromosa from someone who was asking for litten
pokemon,not_removed,the good ones go quickly leaving the unfair ones there is an excess of people searching and fewer people depositing its far better to deposit and wait for someone to find your own good trade ive not had to wait longer than a day before and its usually done within the hour ive also had better luck with breeding rejects just list how many perfect ivs it has and it will soon go dont be a dick and lie about it though just to see how far i could push it i put a cyndaquil of which i had many up asking for a xerneas in y since i was going to be without my for the weekend anyway by the time i got back the trade had completed it pays to be patient and be the one putting the trade up
pokemon,not_removed,have you actually tried it it removes all legendarymythicalubs
pokemon,not_removed,btw how do you see all starters so you can trade for them obviously you see your own and your rivals but where do you find the first form of the other starter in game
pokemon,not_removed,deleted
pokemon,not_removed,gen vi i remember training an entire box of dragonite trading all of them for mewtwo and then subsequently trading those mewtwo for the legendary birds unbreedables per save file and only bird
pokemon,not_removed,do you want a popplio i can breed one for you
pokemon,not_removed,i have spare littens ill try to find you
pokemon,not_removed,you guys get it the gts is a sellers market and the most requested pokemon arent hard at all to farm up quickest shiny charm ive ever gotten
pokemon,not_removed,no no those not i mean chikorita totodile cyndaquill oshawott tepig snivy but yeah as a reminder gen vii starters in any other ball are hacked
pokemon,not_removed,exactly people will do a heap for trade evos and weavile
pokemon,not_removed,xerneas for a cynaquill these kids dont know math
pokemon,not_removed,yes thats how i got litten the gts has basically no good trades unless you enable that option
pokemon,not_removed,so it removes every single trade
pokemon,not_removed,you can manually type in the name of any pokemon you are looking for
pokemon,not_removed,see i am planning on catching and training a ton of jangmoo and evolving them to get most of the legendaries it is a really good strategy and of the time it works all the time
pokemon,not_removed,thanks dude
pokemon,not_removed,porygon fucking z
pokemon,not_removed,on x i used to spam the gts with mudkip for deoxys not sure why as it stands i have over deoxys
pokemon,not_removed,that comment was directed at the guy who was saying it doesnt include tapus and ubs
pokemon,not_removed,sometimes yes it does it sometimes
pokemon,not_removed,hmm did you receive litten only one person wants one for rowlet and theyre in japan that i can find
pokemon,not_removed,rpokemontrades and ffs you get given a porygon and an upgrade and dubious disc
pokemon,not_removed,at level or higher
pokemon,not_removed,no i didnt rowlet is still up for trade
pokemon,not_removed,but the gts is not designed for trading pokemon that evolve while holding an item because you cant request a pokemon holding an item
pokemon,not_removed,wait we are given an upgrade where
pokemon,not_removed,whats your name in game i can put a litten up in gts for rowlet mine is melissa
pokemon,not_removed,yes and at what point did i mention the gts i said use rpokemontrades asking for help evolving porygon
pokemon,not_removed,same room you get porygon in gotta go into aether and beat faba for the dubious disc from memory
pokemon,not_removed,adamant litten waiting in gts now
pokemon,not_removed,my name ingame is gabs
pokemon,not_removed,so the search option in gts kinda blows cant find it
pokemon,not_removed,nabbed the free code good luck to the others

pokemon,not_removed,they arent dittos though theyre eldritch abominations that dont want to be eldritch abominations and instead want to be loved
pokemon,not_removed,i like to imagine it had an old black and white tv and saw how popular pikachu is and made a black and white one not knowing
pokemon,not_removed,it can there are different types of colorblindness httpwwwcolourblindawarenessorgcolourblindnesstypesofcolourblindness
pokemon,not_removed,in some extreme cases it mean i had a teacher once that could not see colors
pokemon,not_removed,ach wanted there to be sort of a preview in reddit but whatever its a desktop wallpaper of mega lucario and mega absol you can download it in the link if ya want
pokemon,not_removed,makes sense mega lucario is pretty evil hes described in the pokédex as heartless mega absol just wants to save people
pokemon,not_removed,talk about appearance vs reality but lucario does look like he can be a fighting dark type
pokemon,not_removed,and their designs as well lucario has generally darker colours and gets this whole extra spikes and red blood soaked fists in its mega form while absol has white fur and gets wings in its mega form
pokemon,not_removed,definitely there was never really much that read steel type in lucario at all for me neither pure fighting with mega being fightingdark pretty interesting meta
pokemon,not_removed,heh being a fan of the berserk manga has kind of warped my perception of that gatts wears black armor and looks menacing but is the protagonist where griffith wears white feathery armor and has an angelic appearance and is arguably quite evil perhaps looks can be deceiving
pokemon,not_removed,rpokemongo
pokemon,not_removed,im assuming the car was still moving
pokemon,not_removed,that sucks have you caught lots of gastly and haunter
pokemon,not_removed,yeah thats true but at least youre somewhat close lol
pokemon,not_removed,i dont fish unless i have to that said i did get a trubbish with sticky hold and that speeds everything up no refreshing the screen to reload the bubbly water i catch something every time found about sharpedos in like mins dont know their odds but id imagine pretty low especially in a not bubbly spot
pokemon,not_removed,i caught a dhelmise and a bruxish from bubbling rocks its not too much of a pain just time consuming i got rich off the pearls big pearls and pearl strings while searching for mareanie
pokemon,not_removed,sticky hold makes it so you almost never get a message saying nothing seems to be biting so you can catch more pokes in the same amount of time
pokemon,not_removed,hey this isnt rmeirl
pokemon,not_removed,how do you do fellow trainers
pokemon,not_removed,this is my favorite one of these so far and heres the obligatory happy pokemon anniversary

pokemon,not_removed,the dude on the left has no idea what hes doing to the happiny
pokemon,not_removed,happened with sprites its hard to make battle animations implement pokemon amie and a full rotatable pokedex
pokemon,not_removed,does yoshi hatch from its back
pokemon,not_removed,posion the mark of quality
pokemon,not_removed,i liked the description although the fangs could be a little smaller but overall this is very nice
pokemon,not_removed,i really like this nice work
pokemon,not_removed,poshun is that how you pronounce it or did you mean poison
pokemon,not_removed,relevant username
pokemon,not_removed,thats embarrassing
pokemon,not_removed,thanks
pokemon,not_removed,÷
pokemon,not_removed,well it depends moves like surf and waterfall can be useful if you want a widerange attack or a physical water move respectively others like cut or rock smash are more situational moves in the overworld and dont pack that much of a punch so id say that some are good on a team while others are probably best for another pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,i wouldnt worry about it too much since you can always visit the move deleter before the elite if youd like different moves its much less hassle having hm moves spread out on your team going through the storyline than it is to have separate pokemon just for hms
pokemon,not_removed,we dont deserve this level of quality
pokemon,not_removed,oh shit theyre doing alchemy without circles
pokemon,not_removed,i remember when the guy this is based off got a ton of flack for doing this at mtg tournaments its honestly disturbing how many people refuse to use a belt or pull up their pants
pokemon,not_removed,this is a great post its a shame that it wont get nearly as much karma as it deserves
pokemon,not_removed,mays got some top tier smug going
pokemon,not_removed,got an month ban
pokemon,not_removed,i knew he got a ban but i didnt remember for how long then again the way they decide how long to ban people makes little sense like alex bertoncini who keeps gettimg banned for cheating
pokemon,not_removed,this is the best ive only seen screencaps of meowth doing the pose but i didnt know he also says muda
pokemon,not_removed,the problem with ice types isnt the typing itself ice is one of the best offensive typings in the game its that they keep making defensive ice types with little offensive presence and ice is a horrible defensive typing
pokemon,not_removed,ice types need more resistances i always felt that water grass and bug should be resisted by ice i think thatll give a decent buff to them as well as making certain pokemon better such as mamoswine
pokemon,not_removed,makeing it resit dragon ground and water could work
pokemon,not_removed,they could make hail better make it give icetypes a defense buff in the same way that sandstorm gives rocktype pokemon a special defense buff and that could go a long way to making icetype pokemon viable even if only in a hail team
pokemon,not_removed,mostly it needs ice beam and blizzard to have their availability slashed and for more fast offensive ice types to be made ice is a great offensive type but the fact that water types can easily get a powerful ice type attack means that ice us constantly getting screwed over
pokemon,not_removed,my problem with the ice resisting water thing has always been that ice in the real world melts pretty quickly in running water and running water doesnt really freeze as easily the best bet would probably be giving it a resistance to bug and grass or something maybe removing the fighting type weakness the only problem that comes from that is that fighting doesnt really need nerfed at the moment
pokemon,not_removed,for point that would make freeze dry pretty useless especially since only ice types learn it
pokemon,not_removed,i think if they went back and gave some of the plain ice types a secondary type theyd be fine but i think they mostly suffer from being in bad combinations or low stat averages the main problem is that they get type matched with bad combos icewater makes it vulnerable to a lot of really common types grass electric fighting rock iceflying is a great one that needs to get used more along with icefairy to get rid of that nasty fighting weakness like alolan vulpixninetails they could do an icebug for the glass cannon of all glass cannons with the weakness to fire and rock but great coverage if they really needed to buff ice make it resistant to electricity poison and grass ice is a poor conductor of electricity and most plants cant even grow in ice poison just sort of fits in ice is kind of associated with slowing things down like poison it also doesnt help that dragons have copious access to fire moves to counter ice and most physical pokemon get access to some kind of fighting move
pokemon,not_removed,part of the problem is that ice types in general dont have the best stats ice is an offensive type but you get a ton of fat and slow ones like walrein and avalugg who cant even do that well because ice has common weaknesses and only resists itself you would have to buff some of the worst ice types with some sort of combination of new moves like recoverstealth rockicicle crashice shard base stat buffs as needed and add a resistance or two flying and water i feel like buffing hail would also go a long way whether it be through better abusers andor a defense increase as a way to mirror sands special defense for rock types i dont know how much of these ideas youd have to take to truly balance the ice type but theyre food for thought
pokemon,not_removed,i think just better ice pokemon maybe a legend or psuedo legend with good stats and movepool and a sick ability
pokemon,not_removed,i ran an evolution simulator and ice is actually just the worst monotype type defensively if i remember correctly rock and psychic are both worse psychic could be considered good because normal psychic is around the best typing in the game this fact is why psychic was considered op first generation before there were any good ghost moves however when talking about buffing common types defensively buffing rock should be way higher on peoples priority list than ice
pokemon,not_removed,it needs at least one more resistance how about ice resist fairy i mean if fire resist fairy then ice should be too because faries link closely to nature if it becomes too hot or too cold fairies should have trouble doing anything
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think they need a buff i think they should stop making bulk ice types
pokemon,not_removed,most ice type pokemon simply suck their movepool and their abilities are terribad for like of them
pokemon,not_removed,resistances to water grass and ground would make icetypes more viable in the long run but thats just me im not really the best person to commentate on this since i get pulverized by kyurem every now and again if anything i think bug could use an upgrade or two but again thats just me
pokemon,not_removed,ice types can honestly become a lot better with two key changes instead of rock being supereffective against ice vice versa glaciers gouge out mountains it kinda makes sense water resistance would also be cool but ice melts in water whatever hail raises attack and special attack of icetype pokemon by
pokemon,not_removed,i must suck cos i have trouble with ice teams eg hailninetalesweavile
pokemon,not_removed,let ice types be effective on bugs it sounds so logical
pokemon,not_removed,honestly ice types are pretty op currently with the alolan forms of ninetales and sandshrew ice is also one of the few things to kill dragon types without much problem
pokemon,not_removed,to add to that most icetype moves can be accessed by watertype pokemon too sure you lose the bonus from stab but youll probably be able to stay in battle longer since watertypes have naturally higher survivability than icetypes
pokemon,not_removed,because bug needed even more types to resist it
pokemon,not_removed,yes no and no grass and bug are already pretty weak typing offensively especially grass they dont need to be any more weak make it water and ground type and theyll be fine
pokemon,not_removed,that makes sense especially water imo and while resisting grass does make sense for ice i also think that grass is slightly underpowered i dont think the grass type needs any more cons however it could balance out if grass is also given more advantages
pokemon,not_removed,maybe instead of resisting bug and grass since those types are already resisted by so many others how about resisting at least two among ground flying fairy and dragon
pokemon,not_removed,id make it water but grass and bug are pretty bad already id make hail reduce all supereffective multipliers to andor boost defenses by still doesnt make them too great though
pokemon,not_removed,actually imo ice should be weak to water if you question why leave one ice cube on the table an another under a running tap
pokemon,not_removed,yeah other people are saying it should resist grass and bug but those are both horrible offensive types already its ground that needs a nerf not grass not sure how much sense it makes for ice to resist ground but from a balance perspective i think its a great idea
pokemon,not_removed,sandstorm does what now okay i think i am a little too out of the loop
pokemon,not_removed,the problem with that is bug and grass are tied for being the most resisted types at seven theyre in a greater need of a buff as they dont have the defensive capabilities to make up for their offense
pokemon,not_removed,i understand that logic but if we wanna go by real world standards everything should be weak to almost everything enough fire will kill anything even aquatic creatures plants can drown ect
pokemon,not_removed,maybe change the effects of the move higher chance to freeze water types something like that its only one move and its existence only gave icetypes the slightest buff i think more can be done
pokemon,not_removed,icewater destroys any grass type or rock type that is slower than itself and electric types usually dies in one hit to neutral stab anyways the real problem with icewater is other water types
pokemon,not_removed,if they did that plus make previous icetype pokémon better then that would be fantastic i think in the next generation gamefreak should give great buffs to some previous pokémon in general to make gen more interesting
pokemon,not_removed,but unstabilizing the metagame is always a pro though
pokemon,not_removed,i hope youre joking lol ice is the worst type aside from bug the only two relevant ice types in competitive are mamoswine and weavile whom are only there because they have another typing there is not a single other relevant ice type in competitive that isnt a legendary ice offensively is really good but nearly every pokemon that is typed with ice is crap
pokemon,not_removed,if a pokémon had all eighteen types simultaneously it would have a resistance to grass and bug
pokemon,not_removed,another option is to have ice lose its weakness to fighting or steel fighting already has a good number of ses and steel is already an amazing defensive type so losing one of its three ses shouldnt hurt it much
pokemon,not_removed,it was added in generation its a big reason why tyranitar is as good as it is
pokemon,not_removed,things i didnt know sandstorm weather condition did until just now from generation iv onward raises the special defense of all rocktype pokémon by causes moonlight synthesis and morning sun to recover ¼ of max hp half the normal amount in generation ii from generation iii onward halves the power of solar beam and solar blade source bulbapedia
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know if its always been like that but its been like that for a long time
pokemon,not_removed,not really you need a lot more water to do the same damage to a plant as a lighter will same way water spout does about the same damage to grass types as ember does assuming equal statsstab
pokemon,not_removed,make it bst and double damage versus watertypes
pokemon,not_removed,i want them to make milotic waterfairy and give it more fairy moves to make it a more defensive pokemon as opposed to the offensive gyarados pls gf
pokemon,not_removed,hey bugs are pretty badass
pokemon,not_removed,weavile isnt competitive because of its dark typing its dark type hinders it by adding two weaknesses and giving it a times weakness it is a good pokemon because it is a very offensive pokemon which meshes well with as offensive a type as ice its a similar story for mamoswine it has access to the best dual type combo in the game and gets double stab from it its hidden ability also patches up one of its biggest problems both pokemon are offensive monsters if used properly their defensive typing is irrelevant
pokemon,not_removed,doesnt that make freezedry weaker though right now its base power is and supereffective against water types
pokemon,not_removed,i love bug pokemon but speaking from a competitive standpoint theyre offensively and defensively bad scizor forretress scoliopede and volcarona are the only non legendarymega bugs that are decent that come to mind at least
pokemon,not_removed,if weavile wasnt part dark and was purely ice type it wouldnt be competitively used as it is now stab knock off is what makes it great
pokemon,not_removed,currently it is bst with the effect of being super effective versus water pokemon instead of not very effective this thread proposes to change ice type to be se against water type pokemon if this would happen freeze dry would be pointless due to ice hitting water se anyways instead of nve like it is now changing it to bst and doubling its power versus water types would cause it to be a bst move against water pokemon then you would still have to factor in the type advantage multiplier turning it into a bst move without any drawbacks while blizzard would be as strong versus water pokemon it still has shaky accuracy
pokemon,not_removed,no love to golisopod
pokemon,not_removed,also stab icecicle crash and ice shard with a great speed stat that extra damage on knock off can be clutch though what knock outs does it lose without dark typing
pokemon,not_removed,freeze dry isnt only to cover water types though a lot of ice types have the move as its sole ice stab making it weaker than it already is would really limit its usage and if ice were no longer resisted by water itd be extremely situational as an ice beam or blizzard will be more beneficial the majority of the time
pokemon,not_removed,i mean golisopod is okay but it has a pretty terrible ability and has a weakness to stealth rocks which set it to health and at that point any mon can hit it and make it rotate out once it hits or below which itll then take another upon bringing it back in
pokemon,not_removed,well assuming it loses the power increase on knock off it loses to nearly every steel type that switches in on it as well as losing out on a lot of kos for psychic pokemon jirachi metagross bronzong victini mega zam etc etc as well as a few ghost pokemon amarowakchandy comes to mind here and with a bit of prior damage youd lose kos on pokemon like volcarona rotomw magnezone heatran slowbro and so forth
pokemon,not_removed,thats the issue you have to face because its whole point would vanish want to make it and run into the scaldsurf issue doubling on water to me seems like the range it would have to be in order to not be a brain dead alternative to ice beam while still being able to have an impact it certainly would be a really niche move but still have an impact and be viable under some circumstances how would you balance it keeping it at and lowering the factor from to
pokemon,not_removed,you got a point there personally my waterbug preference is araquanid which yeah still has a major weakness to fire and rocks but its a pretty decent mon i just wouldnt do an all bug team give a slot to a bug yes but not all
pokemon,not_removed,yep that sounds pretty bad i guess i shouldnt be surprised dark type moves suck if you just look at their damage output so including them solely for coverage as opposed to their beneficial side effects is stupid
pokemon,not_removed,id definitely go with keeping it at or even raising the bp to and lowering the factor to you have to take into account that water types will be more reluctant to stay in against ice types if they suddenly lose their resist to the type the reason freeze dry is so good now is because it offers valuable se type coverage to ice types that normal ice moves dont offer
pokemon,not_removed,golisopod would have been great though in my eyes if it had any other ability i really like araquanid as well as with water bubble you basically have abilities in one its stats are unfortunately a bit lack luster though
pokemon,not_removed,i agree in fact i think they made the move knock off a bit too strong it went from a near worthless move with base power to an insanely strong base power of if the opponent has no item in my opinion it should be
pokemon,not_removed,yeah im still trying to figure out what nature is best to try to go for to try to give it a chance my in game one had a neutral nature quirky so its stats were what i got nothing got boosted though my go to bug in my bt and battle spot team slots goes to my galvantula i bred six iv brave nature discharge leech life bug buzz twave
pokemon,not_removed,hey rapid spin has base power and is far less useful than knock off yet it still gets usage
pokemon,not_removed,edit i think anything that lowers it speed but boosts another stat would be helpful brave i think would be awesome for it
pokemon,not_removed,uh rapid spinknock off in terms of competitive play rapid spin is one of two moves that removes entry hazards which are run on all standard competitive teams singles while the other one defog also removes your own
pokemon,not_removed,ill give that a shot then i dunno why but i love trying to make hard to work with pokemon do well its a challenge but its fun
pokemon,not_removed,im not sure how to feel about this
pokemon,not_removed,too bad we dont get the pidgeotite before the competition i guess bird jesus will have to wait praise helix
pokemon,not_removed,huh i dont see anything saying we cant use pokemon bred in a previous gen too bad its not doubles or id bring up some of my unova sun team drought ninetails hp ice lilligant specifically edit ohhh i could bring in my curselax o
pokemon,not_removed,when do we get the stones from last challenge
pokemon,not_removed,im getting so sick of the gen pandering
pokemon,not_removed,im starting to get sick of gen
pokemon,not_removed,going to just use my regulars with maybe alolan muk or zapdos replacing my alakazam that im using for the global mission
pokemon,not_removed,this will be interesting singles aint my favourite though
pokemon,not_removed,how do i sign up for these
pokemon,not_removed,ive got a pidgey with mimic just waiting to transfer over from gen finally no guard sheer cold mega pidgeot will be mine
pokemon,not_removed,last competition i got destroyed by tapus and raichu because i have no sense of team building and even less experience battling doubles maybe this time ill come back and do better i just want those mega stones d
pokemon,not_removed,is it too late to register for the last competition i didnt even know about it
pokemon,not_removed,oh crap i forgot to do the last tournamentcraaaaaaaap
pokemon,not_removed,i went through the trouble of figuring out the fully evolved pokemon this adds to the standard alola pokedex so i thought id share it megas have an because reddit formatting charizard gets two because of course he does the fucker im also assuming the beedrillite actually gets rewarded in time just kidding no megastones because fuck you lol venusaur charizard blastoise beedrill pidgeot arbok nidoking nidoqueen vileplume venomoth rapidash farfetchd dodrio dewgong onix kingler electrode hitmonlee hitmonchan lickitung weezing tangela mr mime jynx omastar kabutops articuno zapdos moltres all of the vanilla versions of the alolan variants victreebell rhydon and seadra are also legal island scan pokemon regardless of whether its strictly alolan pokedex at first blush i imagine this is quite similar to the alolan pokedex meta we had before bank with venusaur the charizards beedrill and zapdos for the major threats and blastoise nidoking andor nidoqueen omastar and kabutops possibly seeing some play venusaur and charizard might find something to do the former being a contender without its mega and the latter being a passable fire type in a meta with no stealth rock and otherwise starved for fire types
pokemon,not_removed,i think this competition idea looks great i cant wait to see what the meta will be this is sure to make some interesting teams as much as some people seem to bash on kanto designs
pokemon,not_removed,well i guess ill just update the singles team i was using previously with one or two different mons and roll with that
pokemon,not_removed,when is registration
pokemon,not_removed,i might breed my kanto classic team just for this competition just put a tapu or two on my team then ill be set pray i do better than i did in kanto classic competition
pokemon,not_removed,ive heard rumors that when using kanto pokémon that are not found in the alolan pokédex including nonalola forms should come from rby must have the gameboy icon in it was stated that in this competition the only pokémon you can use are those you could discover in the kanto region in pokémon red pokémon blue or pokémon yellow along with pokémon of the alola region you can find in pokémon sun and pokémon moon has anyone confirmed this yet
pokemon,not_removed,im still waiting to learn how to download the mega stones from last competition
pokemon,not_removed,quick question will this be the only way to ever get these mega stones
pokemon,not_removed,wait one second kanto x alola kanto fucking x alola i know its supposed to mean versus or combined but it sound like a ship to me gen pandering much
pokemon,not_removed,yay new megas availables soon wtf with this it will takes more than a year to have all the missing ones but i dont care of tournament i guess its time to make a stupid team again so unconveniant to subscribe to it argh choose one or more d
pokemon,not_removed,you cant use megas anyway
pokemon,not_removed,unless they change them from what the download regulations allow you can indeed use ones youve transferred i tested it myself on one of my teams that is entirely from past gens and the download regulations only blocked suicune mow rotom and cresselia despite my chansey and zapdos being from gen and my lucario being from gen
pokemon,not_removed,sometime after the rankings are put up its only for people who did the default battles and are ranked if youre disqualified for dcing on people too much or the like you dont get them so it has to be done after rankings are calculated
pokemon,not_removed,if its anything like last year though probably have the next tournament add in johto then on through the rest of the regions
pokemon,not_removed,same here i was going through some of the comments on the pokemon twitters tweets dueing the leadup to the anniversary and holy shit theres a scathing hatred for gen v maybe that sort of backlash is one of the main reasons why theres been so much kanto pandering for the last couple gens
pokemon,not_removed,you unlock the castle in the festival plaza in the game menu then go to the pc right next to the entrance inside it and create a game sync id which is the second option on it then you go to and either sign up for a pokémon trainer club account there or login with your existing information if you already have one when you log in it will then ask for a game sync id if you dont already have one linked or allow you to choose an already linked game if you do i assume itll be the former once youve entered the sync id you just created your save will be linked to that global link account and you just have to check back on the global link on the day registration opens you just log in and there are several ways to get to the entry page but the simplest is to click the link to the competition page in the news article theyll put up announcing that registration is open youll be taken to a page with links for the rules and whatnot and be able to click through for entry
pokemon,not_removed,should we tell them
pokemon,not_removed,alot of people i spoke to over the weekend couldnt get to sign up for it before last thursday i feel sorry for them i signed up but couldnt my team prepared for the ic needed to put random already ev mons on the team
pokemon,not_removed,from the rules section • mega stones are not allowed so sorry
pokemon,not_removed,you cant use megas
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know how much ill honestly like this pretty much all kanto pokemon are shit with a few exceptions being mega pokemon which are again banned nidokingnidoqueen clefable and dragonite chansey probably isnt viable anymore due to the overwhelming presence of zmoves and alolan muk counters chansey this isnt counting alolan forms arcanine may be viable considering how loosely the rules are written this might mean and or it might mean and alola regional pokedex theres extremely loose wording leaving me guessing as to whether pokemon like electivire and crobat will be banned i genuinely cant see any good kanto pokemon other than that they all just competitively suck badly i predict this competition will feature almost entirely alolan pokemon and regional variants
pokemon,not_removed,the only pokémon you can use are those you could discover in the kanto region
pokemon,not_removed,itll be a code distributed on global link likely within the next few days im sure an announcement will pop up on this sub the moment it occurs
pokemon,not_removed,competitions take some time to tally the results and then some more time to dole out the rewards it should happen within two weeks at the latest
pokemon,not_removed,i think you can get the stones after a month or two if you didnt participate
pokemon,not_removed,hey im all of those do i win a prize
pokemon,not_removed,i swear the hate for gen is just a trend like hating cod or pokemon go this sub is the only place gen gets praised and i find that sad since its my favourite gen
pokemon,not_removed,slowbro here tell em what
pokemon,not_removed,they actually now its all in the alola pokedex vs the first alolan only would have been a bit more interesting arcanine is absolutely viable in this format because it was viable when it was basically the only decent fire type in the alolan pokedex metas maybe charizard will give it competition because doesnt have the ubiquitous stealth rock nail in the coffin but i wouldnt hold my breath either because solar power is certainly no intimidate i wouldnt discount zapdos either it was a good defensive electric type in gen bss it competes with tapu koko and bss isnt exactly a defensive metagame but they fulfill sufficiently different roles it will probably see some play
pokemon,not_removed,go to eligible pokemon the entire alola regional pokedex can be used
pokemon,not_removed,chansey probably isnt viable anymore due to the overwhelming presence of zmoves and alolan muk counters chansey this is actually the first time ive ever felt chansey was useful never had it go off as planned when ive used it in the past but i went through battles yesterday using one and it was the only thing left on my side of the field for of them only lost two and one was purely thanks to a critspecial defense drop on a psychic
pokemon,not_removed,youre probably right ive been looking over the regional dex again and cant honestly say there are a lot of kanto pokemon id trust on my team without their mega stones i have a feeling this idea sounds way cooler in conception than when you actually start thinking about it now i feel silly for getting my hopes up
pokemon,not_removed,great but can you use pokémon marked with a ⬟ or a gameboy
pokemon,not_removed,good to know thank you
pokemon,not_removed,you win my upvote and
pokemon,not_removed,vps usually rather ok with it moreso than they are for gens iii and vi most of the time its definitely one of my favourite gens too especially because of
pokemon,not_removed,i realized after i said it that i totally misunderstood you and im actually the slowking here lol i thought you wanted to use the gen mega pidgeot in the battle competition which would have been impossible in a dozen ways but then i realized after you meant you wanted to use it after when you actually get the pidgeotite my bad
pokemon,not_removed,what gens are pokemon allowed from and and and
pokemon,not_removed,i cant find any actual verbiage about pentagon or clover symbols but i feel its safe to assume its the default gen and gen pokemon only they do mention red blue and yellow but im pretty sure thats a clumsy way of saying not the pokedex from fire red leaf green rather than were allowing virtual console pokemon this time
pokemon,not_removed,clicking the pokémonmovesitems tab in the above link shows this eligible pokémon are restricted to those that you caught hatched from eggs or received as a mystery gift in pokémon sun or pokémon moon
pokemon,not_removed,sorry got a screenshot of that i cant find that on the page
pokemon,not_removed,its not there now if it was wouldnt be the first time they messed up on the rules and fixed it once they realized i tested it myself and the download regulations for it allow transferred pokémon too so i dont see how it would make sense for the actual competition not to given that the point of the downloads is to mimic the competitions rules after it ends
pokemon,not_removed,the download regulations allow transferred pokémon excellent i was planning on checking this myself thanks
pokemon,not_removed,interesting observation op if anyone has any suggestions you can respond to this comment or send them in via modmail or we can just keep it consistent and use the dive ball like we do for our subreddits snoo
pokemon,not_removed,on alien blue this sub has a snoo its just a pikachu snoo
pokemon,not_removed,maybe a snoo withe ashsreds hat
pokemon,not_removed,more like a pikasnoo
pokemon,not_removed,og reds hat would be the best
pokemon,not_removed,it predates my arrival on the mod team however uawildabra was kind enough to explain it to me during the april fools setup when tldr during our first css implementation we switched from a pikasnoo to a dive ball snoo because we had a lot of paws playing around in our spaghetti code
pokemon,not_removed,tis a tale spun by many weavers of threads every time it passes hands its threads grow more frayed but somehow the tapestry remains intact
pokemon,not_removed,maybe you were banned
pokemon,not_removed,for what i never even joined
pokemon,not_removed,and so begins the great magnemite chain of
pokemon,not_removed,i named all of mine rpokemon which is relevant enough
pokemon,not_removed,yep thats what ive been doing
pokemon,not_removed,hes not with the crowd
pokemon,not_removed,this theme is sadly underated and also one of my favourite themes its so relaxing i would literally just go up and read the new board and stop reading it and just listen to the music its just so good also good remix too
pokemon,not_removed,the pokedex should definitely be able to act as an inbattle encyclopedia
pokemon,not_removed,it would be amazing to see what pokemon is weak to different types and its move pools but you would have to find these things out by catching and for the move pools to raise that pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,not knowing a certain pokemons type moves and stats is meant to serve as motivation to go out and catch that pokemon for yourself to find out or at the very least hit it with attacks of different types until you learn what works no ones expected to know the entire type chart from the getgo youre expected to feel your way around and experiment until you get the hang of it eventually knowing all of the types and their interactions becomes second nature but its a long road getting there just as your player character climbs from starting trainer to champion you yourself slowly become better at the game
pokemon,not_removed,solgaleo gx
pokemon,not_removed,heres a picture of the gx card which is probably what she means
pokemon,not_removed,thanks im glad people were able to respond before the post was removed not sure why the mods took it down i didnt get any message about it
pokemon,not_removed,let me tell you something when i was a kid scyther was without a doubt my favourite pokemon and i can honestly say this is without a doubt your best work yet there is so much detail the shading is perfect and scyther looks as cool as ever
pokemon,not_removed,damn dude that looks great meanwhile im over here struggling to draw an electrode lol
pokemon,not_removed,siiiick
pokemon,not_removed,im a big fan of black cell shading this is a great pose with perfect artstyle of a great pokemon thanks
pokemon,not_removed,the shading on this is phenomenal
pokemon,not_removed,this is actually really really good im a fan love your art style
pokemon,not_removed,saved
pokemon,not_removed,amazing cant wait to see porygon
pokemon,not_removed,siiiiick i cant believe that a person made this how long did this take i dont know art
pokemon,not_removed,beautiful stuff
pokemon,not_removed,woah
pokemon,not_removed,without a doubt op
pokemon,not_removed,i second this this is my favorite one so far too incredible work
pokemon,not_removed,respect coming from a cradily nice work ya fossil
pokemon,not_removed,probably close to three hours
pokemon,not_removed,a male smeargle can pass any egg moves on to any pokemon in the field egg group
pokemon,not_removed,so why wouldnt it be working then
pokemon,not_removed,it is possible that it is no longer an egg move for sneasel or you need to delete a move from the mother if it is getting four moves from her and so has no room for another move from the father
pokemon,not_removed,do they know moves when hatched the moves apply in a certain order and can get overwritten if there are too many egg moves
pokemon,not_removed,thank you
pokemon,not_removed,looks good
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,httpiimgurcomswnoinipng
pokemon,not_removed,sinnoh remakes confirmed
pokemon,not_removed,iirc cyrus was typing to take control of dialga and palkia so he could turn earth world into something similar to the distortion world then giratina kidnapped him to distortion world to stop the destruction i doubt that the ultra beasts reside in the same dimension as giratina i think they are two separate dimensions this would be perfect plotwise for team galactic because they can just stumble upon the ultra beast dimension and using an evil science machine open portals wherever they want so cyrus and ultra beasts
pokemon,not_removed,no i wouldnt say this is stupid at all with all the talk about alternate dimensions in sm it makes one wonder where gf will go if we ever get the dp remakes there is mention of dialga and palkia in sm so perhaps it will all tie in
pokemon,not_removed,yaaaaaay
pokemon,not_removed,ahaa open the portal click vrrrrr aaaaah wrong portal wrong portaal
pokemon,not_removed,yeah youre probably right cryrus was going on about remaking the world not making a new one right its been ages since i played gen which is a sin cause its my favourite
pokemon,not_removed,maybe charon will finally be relevant in the main story
pokemon,not_removed,maybe post game you can use dialgapalkiagiratina to go to said alternate universe and find he ultra beasts
pokemon,not_removed,you make a fair point now that i think about it this is great setup for a gen remake which already has me hyped despite getting sm a month ago something else they could bring back is dialgas primal forme from mystery dungeon timedarknesssky what with the recent reintroduction of primal pokémon in oras thank you for the comment
pokemon,not_removed,gen represent
pokemon,not_removed,cryrus lol
pokemon,not_removed,that would be cool it would prevent having ultra beasts as a oneoff for sm
pokemon,not_removed,danm straight
pokemon,not_removed,yeah we got poketech
pokemon,not_removed,yay the iwatch but in pokemon wait they predicted the iwatch
pokemon,not_removed,i know thats what i thought i vote magikarp coin flip as best poketech app
pokemon,not_removed,or will he ever have his promised battle with max
pokemon,not_removed,yeah but he truly cares about them so maybe in a movie
pokemon,not_removed,nobody remembers pidgeot
pokemon,not_removed,i want there to be an alolan butterfree to be designed after the pink butterfree so they can make an episode about ash reuniting with his butterfree or maybe a child of his butterfree or something like that
pokemon,not_removed,given ashs pretty horrible memory i doubt he even knows what a butterfree is much less what his own butterfree looks like
pokemon,not_removed,in the japanese version of that scene butterfree are said to die after they mate
pokemon,not_removed,not likely the closest we got was an episode with flashback while hes helping a caterpie to evolve
pokemon,not_removed,mega butterfree reunion please
pokemon,not_removed,i wonder if ash will leave his greninja behind when he goes to alola that will probably be the strangest andor most upsetting goodbye
pokemon,not_removed,i think butterflies die after mating so ash just sent his butterfree to die
pokemon,not_removed,we can just imagine it was done through sawyer
pokemon,not_removed,hopefully
pokemon,not_removed,i even want pidgeot back more than any other pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,they actually had an episode in the decolora islands arc right before the start of xy where they come across a butterfree mating season and ash reminisces about his butterfree
pokemon,not_removed,oh
pokemon,not_removed,good luck breeding for nature anime peeps
pokemon,not_removed,definitely not true according to dogasu of dogasus backpack what brock says in japanese is if ash doesnt let butterfee go itll never produce any offspring people translating this probably mistook the word for offspring with the word for death
pokemon,not_removed,not true
pokemon,not_removed,k thanks bye
pokemon,not_removed,i can actually see greninja being left with the ninja village people itd make me sad as fuck but i think its not out of the question
pokemon,not_removed,yeah
pokemon,not_removed,that episode disappointed me really hard i thought he was going to meet his butterfree again i doubt butterfree would be returning to his team but it would have been nice to see them meet again
pokemon,not_removed,theres a theory going around that the alolan butterfree from the credible leaks from a while back will resemble the pink butterfree and will function as a way to bring butterfree back to the anime
pokemon,not_removed,how can they know theyre rushers
pokemon,not_removed,lucky egg got it in post game but apparently you can get it before you leave the first island
pokemon,not_removed,rpokemontrades
pokemon,not_removed,mark as spoilers
pokemon,not_removed,alternatively it looks like you can buy a print
pokemon,not_removed,if you dont want to print it you could just commission an artist somewhere to create it to your specifications
pokemon,not_removed,probably amazon or etsy
pokemon,not_removed,i bought that exact poster of red bubble just a couple months ago are they really all gone
pokemon,not_removed,damn thats a lot for such a small picture lol
pokemon,not_removed,perfect
pokemon,not_removed,paper print costs bucks its more closer to the original but god damn
pokemon,not_removed,redbubble recently had a copyright claim by pokemon and removed a lot of designs
pokemon,not_removed,do you have a link to the one you got
pokemon,not_removed,any plans to do the other alola starters
pokemon,not_removed,so cute where do you buy your fabric i only live around small fabric stores and they dont usually have all the colors i want
pokemon,not_removed,that is honestly so cute
pokemon,not_removed,thanks for the template i have some fabric in my stash that would be great for this
pokemon,not_removed,i have a template on paper for litten but it was very difficult to sew the plush im on sure if theres much that can be done about that though as littens face is surprising complicated will add it to the site in a few days
pokemon,not_removed,i buy it all online i had the same problem with local fabric stores theres loads of stuff for upholstery but nothing for toy making i get mine from httpwwwplushaddictcouk but i think theyre uk only if youre in the us and perhaps other places then search for minky fabrics online
pokemon,not_removed,yay hope to see a popplio one eventually d
pokemon,not_removed,this is actually really good it well combines of my favorite things jojo pokemon and includes my fav jojo and fav gen character well done
pokemon,not_removed,some other pokemonrelated stuff i made in the past few months starting from least to most satisfied

pokemon,not_removed,i ordered balls from toywiz for bucks with shippingcanadian the key was searching pop battle now each one of my kids can have one thank you guys very much for your help
pokemon,not_removed,i live in japan if youd like i can try and look for you no promises ill find it though
pokemon,not_removed,that is a diamond and pearl toy that came out to years ago you are going to have a hard time finding one cheep if i was in your shoes i would tell your son to learn to look after his expensive toys form half way around the world
pokemon,not_removed,i think this is what your looking for
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,that is super nice of you but if i can find an online option id rather do that then ask for such a big favor
pokemon,not_removed,my oldest son is pretty good about taking care of his toys but my youngest son got his hands on it who is only if my oldest son had broken it himself i wouldnt be trying to replace it
pokemon,not_removed,yes thats exactly it bucks usd though ouch
pokemon,not_removed,i ordered the dollar one listed on amazonca not the same char but good enough this sub is awesome you guys have been so helpful thank you
pokemon,not_removed,i understand how year olds can be
pokemon,not_removed,i will find a better price i googled yanmega pokeball toy
pokemon,not_removed,what is this
pokemon,not_removed,wrong sub
pokemon,not_removed,sorry my bad
pokemon,not_removed,do you take requests if so you should do dragalge next its a pokemon no one seems to talk about
pokemon,not_removed,how do you this on paint
pokemon,not_removed,im afraid im a slave to the random number generator however dragalgae is so underrated
pokemon,not_removed,know what this game needs firefighting starters

pokemon,not_removed,which is precisely why every time i see someone post here about which anime season is the best i always respond with the earlier anime seasons are more comedy while the later seasons are more serious w exception of bw series which is shit xyz does not have this humor it is rather serious and focuses more on the plot and the lore this is i think why older pokemon fans love the xyz anime apart from the modern art style and serena however the earlier anime seasons maybe before the sinnoh arc werent too heavy on the lore but rather more fun than serious i wish that the new sunmoon anime with the new art style would still have comedic scenes like this and puns but also develop a deeper plot and unfold the sunmoon lore more than the earlier anime seasons

pokemon,not_removed,nah clefairy didnt explode afterwards
pokemon,not_removed,they do in smogons tiers wigglytuff is actually pretty unique in the pu tier thanks to competitive and being a bulky special attacker with stealth rock access
pokemon,not_removed,se jun park used a wigglytuff in one of his vgc teams it was an assault vest set

pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,were darth xenochu now
pokemon,not_removed,rfestivalplaza
pokemon,not_removed,thanks
pokemon,not_removed,oh her poor ankles
pokemon,not_removed,sun and moon are definitely harder than xy obviously you should turn your exp share off
pokemon,not_removed,i wouldnt call blues first challenge difficultjust spam tackle and winthats how the first rival fights have always been and whether hau asks or not the first rival fight is literally spamming the strongest offensive move so i see no change in difficulty as far as thats concerned also if the rival heals you after a battle what on earth is wrong about that if it was before the battle id see your point but getting healed is not a big deal one way or the other you have the option to turn off the exp share you determine how hard or easy the game is based on your choices
pokemon,not_removed,these additions are more about convenience than difficulty like in red and blue money and inventory space were limited so instead of buying healing items youd trek back to the pokemon center every time your pokemon fainted or got a status problem it wasnt difficult it was just tedious same with leveling up it took forever because nothing gave out decent exp but if you were patient it was super easy the battles themselves are more difficult totem pokemon start with stat boosts and their allies heal and buff them ai trainers swap out their pokemon sometimes and give them hold items wild pokemon call allies when youve got them on the ropes hau teaches his decidueye smack down to give you a nasty surprise when you send out incineroar okay maybe that just happened to me also a lot of the convenient stuff is optional you can turn off exp share the minute you get it you can change the battle mode to set instead of shift so you dont have an unfair advantage you can just refuse to use zmoves and the characters in game will acknowledge it and congratulate you you just have to optout of easy mode
pokemon,not_removed,the earlier games arent hard
pokemon,not_removed,getting to level has nothing to do with difficulty beating the elite four becomes childs play after the first few times you beat them after that it is just a mindless grind to oras rival healing you after a difficult battle saves you a trip to a pokemon center again this isnt difficulty this is smoothing out the pacing of the game in rse i could just as easily have used a couple healing items for the same effect as my rival healing me and it wouldnt have been a big impact on my budget because money has never been a problem in pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon games are hard or easy depending on how you play for example you can try to always be overlevel and the game become a piece of cake
pokemon,not_removed,the exp share is a difficultly mode just like everyone has always asked since pokemon isnt hard sure xy are insanely easy but no pokemon game id hard theyre designed to be beaten by kids who are as young as or
pokemon,not_removed,xy and oras were easy but sumo is definately not easy i had to soft reset alot of times because i made bad move the champion also i found extremely hard
pokemon,not_removed,tedious difficult
pokemon,not_removed,sun and moon are not easy
pokemon,not_removed,have you played sun and moon yet they are definitely not easier yeah you do get a few free heals from your rival but overall the gameplay is a lot harder
pokemon,not_removed,hell sun and moon are harder than red and blue
pokemon,not_removed,you also should have a potion too in case your rival crits or something
pokemon,not_removed,looks like a gastly to me
pokemon,not_removed,either ghastly or weezing
pokemon,not_removed,obviously a very skilled ditto
pokemon,not_removed,jigglypuff seen from above
pokemon,not_removed,moltres
pokemon,not_removed,it is indeed a gastly
pokemon,not_removed,wow thats awesome i honestly thought it was a glitch because ive never seen a gastly in my area before
pokemon,not_removed,i think its just a matter of level maybe i could be wrong but i didnt start getting any gastly in my area until after id reached level or so that said i could be wrong about it being a level thing but isnt it confirmed you encounter rarer pokemon at higher levels
pokemon,not_removed,i came to love this guy so much because of duel one of the best figures in the game nice drawing op
pokemon,not_removed,thanks
pokemon,not_removed,ball is super soft cat is unharmed
pokemon,not_removed,could be applied to any video game really
pokemon,not_removed,gotta love dat bugfighting shedinja tho
pokemon,not_removed,well it is a spinoff for moblie phone of all things of course it wont have the same depth as the main series
pokemon,not_removed,was shedninja ever good
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon go is garbage
pokemon,not_removed,remember inverse battle shedinja
pokemon,not_removed,yes especially if the opponent doesnt have anything that can cause hail or sandstorm or any fire flying rock ghost or dark type moves because if the opponent doesnt have any of those shedinja is almost impossible to kill
pokemon,not_removed,ill have to keep that in mind interesting
pokemon,not_removed,litten has seen some things man
pokemon,not_removed,so cute d keep it up want a full kitty next time
pokemon,not_removed,lol
pokemon,not_removed,the great pokémon war there were things there hell never forget
pokemon,not_removed,thank you
pokemon,not_removed,they are compatible and for the first time ever beldums ball can be passed down
pokemon,not_removed,they can youre just getting unlucky with the randomness
pokemon,not_removed,they can breed just as the guys below said its taking a long time to generate an egg because theyre different species from the same game assuming here if you use a traded beldum or ditto it will go faster its not possible in this case since beldum can only breed with ditto but for the fastest egg generation you need the same species from two different games for example a smeargle you caught and a smeargle you traded for and balls can be inherited check out bulbapedia for breeding information everything you need to know is there
pokemon,not_removed,how are steps even counted in sm
pokemon,not_removed,they can bread wow now i know what to do with these breedject beldums
pokemon,not_removed,as an xy axis movement instead of tiles steps still count
pokemon,not_removed,yes unless its a master or cherish ball beldum then it just goes regular poke infinite beast ball beldums for the gts
pokemon,not_removed,just woke up p
pokemon,not_removed,but how
pokemon,not_removed,dang no wonder why the beldums didnt turn into bread
pokemon,not_removed,movement along the xy axis in a environment is tracked its the same way that things move in visual relation to your character the same tracking of movement along the xy axis is translated into friendship and egg cycles at the appropriate rates steps used to be counted based on the number of tiles moved by the player within the map currently displayed gen but the move to forced a change in technology
pokemon,not_removed,u thanks op for the gift
pokemon,not_removed,there is a code giveaway thread on the sidebar
pokemon,not_removed,z was it already claimed
pokemon,not_removed,first run was decidueye vikavolt marowak exeggutor lycanroc wishiwashi honorable mention to crabrawler who just couldnt keep up in the end second run was primarina toucannon muk salazzle raichu kommoo
pokemon,not_removed,i usually just play with my favorite pokemon i do pay a bit of attention to type balance but thats about it competitive poke can wait till ive finished the game rn i have decidueye lucario greninja aninetales arcanine dragonair to be dragonite
pokemon,not_removed,i carried a team of five decidueye araquanid aninetales snorlax talonflame i never settled on a permanent sixth and so it ended up just being a rotation of pokémon i was leveling up just for my dex
pokemon,not_removed,my team scrambled around with every trial so heres a list of pokes i used that didnt make it to the decidueye grubbin butterfree alolan meowth pikipek wingull magnemite crobat growlithe wishiwashi fletchinder mudsdale greninja minior and lunala my main team in the end was lycanroc day metagross salamence ariados mimikyu and gastrodon
pokemon,not_removed,primarina lurantis mudsdale mimikyu growlithe and lunala i pretty much worked out most of my team before getting the game but growlithe took the empty spot i had left
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye raichu crabominable salazzle araquanid flygon
pokemon,not_removed,team through decidueye vikavolt toucannon lunala salazzle sylveon
pokemon,not_removed,snorlax raichu ariados umbreon archeops lilligant i didnt really use the starter primarina is arguably the best gen water type for ingame with how hard wimpod is to levelup but i didnt have a water type so it was k i generally use teams from that generation though i used absol milotic roserade gallade emolga and torkoal for oras essentially from gen
pokemon,not_removed,my sun team was incineroar roxie vikavolt rail crabominable tommy ray lycanroc lady salazzle aphrodite mimikyu vidachu named after one of my friends usernames my moon team is vulpix aurora gible gabby eevee zapp rockruff rufio staryu capricorn cottonee ariel
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye hariyama lycanroc midday magmortar and golisopod i finished the game with solgaleo as my sixth its switched around postgame its been raichu silvally greninja passimian espeon and a few more
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye toucannon lycanroc midnight salazzle togedemaru komala
pokemon,not_removed,incineroar lycanroc midnight tsareena deino golisopod and alolan dugtrio had to swap golisopod for lunala though i also used munchlax slowpoke and gumshoos at the beginning
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye mudsdale salazzle araichu aninetales and amuk i just picked a mix of my favorites new pokemonforms and balancing
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye mimikyu kommoo arcanine golisopod vikavolt i also used midday lycanroc salazzle alakazam braviary and aninetales for a part of the game but the ones above were the ones i took to the elite four
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye lycanroc midday salazzle araquanid toucannon vikavolt lycanroc carried me surprisingly
pokemon,not_removed,incineroar ashgreninja aexeggutor slowbro gumshoos skarmory
pokemon,not_removed,i just use my favorites when im building a team to play through the main game this time i used my favorites from alola my team was golisopod lurantis primarina ribombee toxapex and turtonator
pokemon,not_removed,finished the elite with incineroar vikavolt salamence metagross aninetails and krookodile
pokemon,not_removed,my team for the was decidueye greninja snorlax mimikyu golem and solgaleo my current team decidueye hydreigon xurkitree silvally toxapex and mimikyu
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye feraligtr incineroar magneton mudbray and sandslash i had never really used a ground pokemon before in any of my teams but i loved mudbray so much when using zmoves that i kept it the type came in very handy at times
pokemon,not_removed,my current team is decidueye lunala celesteela was snorlax for most of the game salazzle tapu koko was alolan raichu for a while golisopod at the moment ive got necrozma and im trying to figure out if i should work him into my team not sure where though
pokemon,not_removed,torracat mimikyu mudsdale araquanid snorlax raichu were what i had for my first honorable mentions to the persian crobat and ribombee i swapped out through the game
pokemon,not_removed,i used primarina magnetonlater replaced by zygarde snorlax oricorio metagross lampent
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye muk golem mudsdale and snorlax were my core the last slot i used to evolve mons for the dex
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye as my physical attackerspecial wall ribombee as a quick special attacker lycanrock midday as a quick physical attacker toxapex as my tank magnezone as the special attacker kommoo as an all around pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,i had a rotation partly because i didnt want to be overleveled and partly because i didnt want to box anyone my championship team was incineroar mudsdale lurantis snorlax toucannon and kommoo then i had crabrawler vikavolt lycanroc bewear muk salazzle and golisipod in rotation
pokemon,not_removed,i went in completely blind my team was incenaroar crobat vikavolt mimikyu mudsdale and ninetales caught just before the end of the game before ninetales i used dhelmise and kommoo in its place since i went in blind i didnt know what to expect my team is very weak to certain types and all my pokemon have relatively low defenses
pokemon,not_removed,primarina salazzle lycanroc midday lurantis toucannon snorlax
pokemon,not_removed,first team was decidueye vikavolt mudsdale salamence gyarados and arcanine as soon as pokebank lands and i can transfer everything so i can keep it my second team will end with whimsicott alolan golem alolan sandslash alolan ninetails golisopod and lucario
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye salazzle toxapex magnezone toucannon passimian i went through chaining for a male igglybuff with cute charm just so i could find a female salandit more easily it took hours but it was nice to have her on my team
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye because i play destiny snorlax utility holdbackblockhappy hour ashgreninja golisopod finally so any good bugs this game mimikyu the one from the trial was just so damn cute agolem back railgun is so cool
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye snorlax magnezone alolan raticate lycanrock midday salazzle
pokemon,not_removed,went for a ground type only run which meant there were some slim pickings especially since i didnt want to use ground types i had used for previous games the restriction kind of forced me to use some crappy pokemon that i wouldnt have otherwise used started with rowlet then rushed my way to the cave with the first trial and caught an alolan diglett i then wonder traded rowlet away which made diglett my effective starter which made hala a pain in the butt because of a digletts steel typing just beat the game today this was what my team looked like after facing the elite alolan diglett♀ honey lvl mudsdale♀ milk lvl forme zygarde peaches lvl palossand♀ cream lvl whiscash♂ nicotine lvl rhydon♂ gravy lvl caught using the island scan palossand zygarde and mudsdale were real mvps rhydon was mostly useless with a lot of incredibly common weaknesses weaknesses and garbage sp def everyone else had their redeeming qualities whiscash even haxed the champion by enduring like hits that should have kod it long story short dont think so much you may even want to put together a suboptimal team ive found they give the game a little bit of challenge and make playthroughs more memorable
pokemon,not_removed,incineroar gyarados alolan marowak metagross snorlax and solgaleo
pokemon,not_removed,for a good chunk of the game my team was incineroar amuk ribombee golisopod then on the last island i picked up dhelmise and lunala
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye minior magnezone and wishiwashi didnt use anything else outside of those since the games trend towards being too easy that bit me on the ass this gen v
pokemon,not_removed,primarina vikavolt salazzle tsareena aninetales my ace toucannon i actually debated a lot with tsareena and lurantis both of them are level and now i chose to settle with tsareena
pokemon,not_removed,for me it was primarina salazzle araquanid tsareena lycanroc lunala after catching it forgot who i replaced it with
pokemon,not_removed,my moon team was incineroar minior palossand ribombee araquanid and togedemaru who surprisingly ended up as my mvp my sun team was primarina silvally muk golem dhelmise and bewear
pokemon,not_removed,i did primarina lycanroc midday mudsdale my mega op pokémon araichu aninetales and tsareena might not be the best team compared to others but my team carried me through and we never had any problems i also used toucannon for a while but mainly on the first two islands sorry for any misspellings im trying to remember the names and spellings without looking them up xd
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye slowbro arcanine toucannon solgao and ninetails toucannon is my power hitter and slowbro is main tank 😎
pokemon,not_removed,decidueye arcanine hariyama aninetales araquanid and solgaleo
pokemon,not_removed,primarina lycanroc day form snorlax alolan marowak mimikyu and alolan exeggutor my team was nothing at all like i had anticipated it to be save for prima and maro exeggutor was really just for filler i think i used him once to kill kukuis lycanroc with leaf storm lol
pokemon,not_removed,incineroar toucannon araichu ribombee vaporeon tsareena i think they worked pretty well together
pokemon,not_removed,primarina snorlax tapu koko these are my primaries i am working to train a few to take to the batter tree still trying to decide which metagross pinsir sableye pyukumuku vikavolt dragonite
pokemon,not_removed,primarina snorlax persian oricorio tsareena flaarionzygardesolgaleo
pokemon,not_removed,my current team is primarina sylveon mimikyu arcanine haxorus and raichu
pokemon,not_removed,i was adamant about using my favorites i know the typing is awful with very common weaknesses that dont cover each other at all decidueye starter muk because it is my favorite magnezone because i caught it early i was surprised to find the magnemite line so i caught it for early game electric support and it won me over slazzazle because i loved the look of it and i wanted a venoshock poison team golisiopod because it is kind of the new magikarp and looks amazing toxapex because i am a masochist and love having pokemon die to earth power also i really wanted a poison team and it is excellent at stall and toxic spike setting for venoshock slazzazle
pokemon,not_removed,i havent beaten the game yet just found the sun flute i have decidueye starmie aninetails agolem salazzle and magneton i havent decided what i want to have as my sixth to replace either electric pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,my team has always been incineroar ribombee lurantis toxapex palossand and lunala i didnt use any other pokemon throughout the story i had it planned out even before i got the game
pokemon,not_removed,coming up with a team for sm was the hardest i have ever had to do but not because of the reason used to be the hardest where there were so many pokemon i wanted to use in game but the opposite there werent even six alolan pokemon including alolan forms that i liked i had to use i like and i dislike but in the end my team was primarina like alolan muk alolan golem mimikyu love tsareena oranguru this is the first generation ever where i do not like more than or pokemon in the whole game
pokemon,not_removed,wicke is thicc
pokemon,not_removed,tiddies
pokemon,not_removed,pew lad
pokemon,not_removed,i actually vocally involuntarily said damn
pokemon,not_removed,thats absolutely wicked
pokemon,not_removed,thicke wicke shold be given the dicke
pokemon,not_removed,lewd
pokemon,not_removed,thicce
pokemon,not_removed,w i c c
pokemon,not_removed,thicke
pokemon,not_removed,malasadas big malasadas
pokemon,not_removed,oops look like i ate the whole thing already
pokemon,not_removed,cant blame you
pokemon,not_removed,to this day i still wonder why lugia is not a waterflying type
pokemon,not_removed,deviantart link
pokemon,not_removed,waterdragon wouldve made sense too
pokemon,not_removed,this brings up another point instead of being a waterdragon type why isnt palkia a psychicdragon type
pokemon,not_removed,space is fluid time is solid
pokemon,not_removed,time is fluid not solid though hm though i just read a source that made a good point but he said its only a guess on top of representing time space and antimatter dialga palkia and giratina also represent the wellknown states of matter dialga steel solid palkia water liquid giratina ghost gas which may explain why giratina is not a darkdragon type
pokemon,not_removed,the way i see it is space is vast an empty like the ocean and most of the ocean is unexplored and filled with alien like creatures time is rigid because you can only move forward plus the solid steel of the gears of a clock that represent time
pokemon,not_removed,been forever since ive drawn last but it sounded fun so here i mean the joke was obvious basically a usb stick and a bee normalghost the nobodypokémon nothing is known about this pokémon even its typing is only guessed it is never seen without its paper bag then it got tricky but hey i present to you the triple form pokémon jokesquerade httpiimgurcomdoriiyvjpg the ragepokémon it is the center of every party and its jokes are hilarious it is mostly found in the alolaregion jokesquerade has a new special attack called total darkness which creates a pitch black surrounding during the battle for rounds this looks so bad tbh i abandon this to the place where mr mime and jynx should be sometimes jokesquerade takes it too far when suddenly the joke is on itself it becomes a true nightmare until it calmes down or the party is over you mostly find this forme during the night time when it is dark during the battle it has this form its stats rise to the max httpiimgurcomjoqrbhxjpg when it is exposed to rays of the morning sun it realizes its fault and becomes extremely weak and small so basically it gets this form when it is exposed to sunlight also its stats fall to the minimum
pokemon,not_removed,this actually sounded kinda fun so in order to procrastinate from my work hone my art skills i did a quick sketch inspired by your letter x topic it started off as a zebra but ended up as a giraffe anyways english xyloraffe xylophone and giraffe japanese コトリン こと koto and キリン giraffe normalsteel xyloraffe was a pokemon brought from a far away region by a traveler long ago it since escaped into the wild and assimilated into the ecosystem of alola xyloraffe bang the two bonelike spheres on the ends of their split tail on the hollow spines of their back to make a beautiful noise this noise is used to calm any potential predators eventually people figured out that the hairlike supports for the spines sounded just like a stringed instrument when played humans would often play together with xyloraffe with them plucking the strings and the pokemon pounding the spines to create a beautiful sound that many people from johto say reminds them of home xyloraffe has a new ability that no one has ever seen before with the sonata ability pokemon on the enemys side deal less damage with contact moves essentially the ability halves the attack stat of enemy pokemon the moveset features a bunch of sound moves such as boomburst and metal sound and a decent variety of special moves like flamethrower and flash cannon
pokemon,not_removed,easy name scurvea the name made me think of curves thus the shape medium typing dragonghost its probably a legendary hard concept i was going for the fossil but then realized entirely new probably meant a made up creature not based on any known extinct animal as opposed to just one that hasnt been done before i tried to salvage it with the name theres also raikou so im even less original
pokemon,not_removed,i decided to go with the fossil prompt and came up with a baby canadian stegosaurus though he half turned into a raptor oops here he is though holding a pecha berry because i didnt know what to do with his arms nbsp name lacertid the maple leaf pokemon from acer lacertas and aphid type rockgrass ability chlorophyll dex entry resurrected from a fossil lacertid thrived in the tropical forests long ago it likes to sleep in the treetops where it can avoid predators and absorb the most sun it is believed to be the ancestor of pokemon such as bulbasaur bw bonus to better blend with the trees it changes colors each season nbsp edit just realized the entirely new fossil thing but oh well maple dino was still fun to think up
pokemon,not_removed,scurvea grasswater the buoy pokemon scurvea are known to follow alongside ships to help in case of emergency any ship that counts a scurvea among its crew is said to be blessed with good health ability rain dish with a name like scurvea two obvious elements come to mind citrus and the open sea so i based this pokemon on a lime and a lifeboat the main body is supposed to resemble a large seed but it ended up looking just as much like a juicer which is pretty funny as well shandom normalghost the enigma pokemon shandoms shadow is part of its body researchers theorize that this pokemon has a separate brain in its shadow but have never been able to confirm this theory ability limbo this pokemon is never normalghost type rather after selecting a move either normal or ghost type is chosen randomly and shandom becomes that type for the duration of the turn shandom still receives stab on both types regardless of which it is at a particular time this is a fakemon ive had bouncing around in my head for some time so when i saw normalghost i knew i had to finally get it onto paper its tangible side is wearing a paper bag similar to mimikyus costume xylash grassfairy the growing pokemon xylash will do anything to protect the health of its flower the tears of this pokemon are popular as a home remedy for illnesses ability natural cure chlorophyll instead of the more obvious x words i went with xylem a type of plant cell as the basis for this pokemon the most wellknown type of xylem is wood which is what xylash is made of this is my least favorite of the three but i still think hes cute
pokemon,not_removed,easy grassghost it hides on the trunks of trees and waits for prey to pass by when something comes near it assaults them with a barrage of powerful attacks medium firewater smokrab live on the ocean floor at the very bottom of deepsea chasms where it is nearly impossible for humans to explore because of this it was not discovered for many years hard httpsimgurcomgallerypogvv land form dragonground adapterrain takes on this form when battling on land or when it holds an item that boosts groundtype moves they usually live in difficulttoaccess mountain valleys which makes this pokemon rare sea form dragonwater adapterrain takes on this form when it battles while surfing or diving or when it holds an item that boosts watertype moves they live in groups of ten individuals out in the open ocean sky form dragonflying adapterrain becomes this form when in a sky battle or while holding an item that boosts flyingtype moves they spend almost all of their time in the air only coming down to the ground to sleep
pokemon,not_removed,a fossil pokemon i created their name is mermiren the one on the left is the deep sea form and is rock ghost and the one on the right is the shallow shores form and is rock fairy the designs of mermiren vary depending on where you find the fossil in the ocean and they are varied in personality they ghost one seems to like to hang around lost sailors to spook them out and the fairy type helps them find their way home
pokemon,not_removed,i might update this post with more but for now i have normalghost sorry for the stupid watermark based on schrodingers cat not an entirely original idea i think i saw a text post about it somewhere on the sub before
pokemon,not_removed,no one has made the keyboard pokemon or a psychic bug and thank you for the upvotes
pokemon,not_removed,xylophone was the first thing that occurred to me as well
pokemon,not_removed,looks like heman went to the pet store
pokemon,not_removed,would you consider doing another thread like this it was really fun
pokemon,not_removed,your prayers have been answered
pokemon,not_removed,i have the new games and i am still trying to mm a larvesta sometimes usually giving it hours a week or so of mm
pokemon,not_removed,lol im still kicking back with the gen games while i hunt for my lost
pokemon,not_removed,currently playing moon but both myself and a friend get together when we have spare time at a local coffee shop or pub and do super multibattles in oras it is the last trophy we both need to beat everything in the maison i have started a nuzlocke of black which i play here and there
pokemon,not_removed,i have yet to finish as as i got lost in the ocean for a bit because well there really was too much water so i still play it in hopes to finish it soon prior to getting lost i was playing yellow alongside as trying to figure out how year old me did better than year old me so dont feel too bad the games arent gonna anywhere just stay away from spoilers and keep catching em
pokemon,not_removed,i too sometimes play silver on my gbc when i dont have my on me
pokemon,not_removed,im sring for a shiny giratina on platinum on my old af dsi picking up a and pokémon sun tomorrow
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,edgecario
pokemon,not_removed,my favourite mega of them all so badass
pokemon,not_removed,those spikes though
pokemon,not_removed,animation ive ever done i clearly need more practice
pokemon,not_removed,the kiddos i teach would friggin go nuts for this
pokemon,not_removed,that sounds very sweet how old
pokemon,not_removed,elementary physical education so most like pokemon and most enjoy dabbing
pokemon,not_removed,hope we manage to complete this
pokemon,not_removed,we need to bring back the magnemite coil from the join avenue days
pokemon,not_removed,as long as people arent hoping to get legendaries in exchange for bs pokémon
pokemon,not_removed,for anyone that wants to register heres the problem
pokemon,not_removed,this ones in the bag like nebby sorry
pokemon,not_removed,literally just do yungoos for yungoos guys no items yungoos only gts
pokemon,not_removed,it was also undergoing maintenance two hours ago when i checked it hopefully it comes on soon this one seems much easier than the last two
pokemon,not_removed,apparently you also get a rare candy if you make at least five gts trades and if we hit by some miracle everybody gets a friend ball too figures that getting a second johto ball would require something that insane
pokemon,not_removed,magnemite away
pokemon,not_removed,this one theres no way we can fuck up this time right
pokemon,not_removed,when is the deadline i try to make at least per day
pokemon,not_removed,guys come on we got this there was a vivillon event that was given out to everyone who participated in the last gts trade pokemon global mission we got this in the bag like nebby jacked up on pokésteroids
pokemon,not_removed,bois
pokemon,not_removed,i want to know why i havent seen aything about this anywhere but this reddit seems pokemon need to be posting that its started even serebii doesnt have anything up yet
pokemon,not_removed,time to harness the power of join avenue magnemites
pokemon,not_removed,why is it gts why couldnt it be wondertrading that would be super easy
pokemon,not_removed,third times the charm guys
pokemon,not_removed,this one is in the bag i expect us to be done by the end of the week
pokemon,not_removed,im cautiously optimistic about this one weve already hit of the goal as of this post about hours after launch hopefully it doesnt slow down too much
pokemon,not_removed,what is the reward for completing these global missions anyways
pokemon,not_removed,one million we got this
pokemon,not_removed,yeah just use trainer fly glitch to get loads of mewtwos and trade them
pokemon,not_removed,we better do it
pokemon,not_removed,i will trade out all my wimpods for common mons
pokemon,not_removed,this should be easy
pokemon,not_removed,how do you participate for this to get the rewards
pokemon,not_removed,i have a bunch of sneasel cubone and slowpoke breedjects that i will upload after work today if anybody is interested
pokemon,not_removed,ok ditto lets get working
pokemon,not_removed,is there some way to organize this like everyone just trade magikarps for magikarps or do we know if they are looking for unique trades ie if person a and b trade then trade back the net trades is
pokemon,not_removed,i wish it was wonder trade instead that would be way more achievable
pokemon,not_removed,im doing my part come visit my gts giveaway
pokemon,not_removed,is this through gts or can wonder trades work if it has to be through gts good fucking luck
pokemon,not_removed,any idea if wonder trade will count towards this
pokemon,not_removed,same i feel like wed be able to finish it easy with wonder trade but im not sure about the gts
pokemon,not_removed,just trade a shit ton of magnemites yo
pokemon,not_removed,come on man thats like of how people use gts sadly
pokemon,not_removed,luckily they actually have a filter for this now
pokemon,not_removed,looks like im not participating or getting any of the unreleased mega stones fix your shit pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,woah thats depressing hopefully they have it fixed before the mega stone competition goes live
pokemon,not_removed,dont jynx it
pokemon,not_removed,so that means were screwed
pokemon,not_removed,yungoos stock exchange
pokemon,not_removed,but if we did vulpix it could literally be fox only
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i hope they took a look at the numbers for the first two and adjusted this actually seems attainable
pokemon,not_removed,at least this one seems a lot more possible than the last few
pokemon,not_removed,yeah doubt it so easy to do
pokemon,not_removed,looks like serebii has february as the end date i saw the info screen once before i got the maintenance error and cant see it again so hopefully well have that confirmed shortly
pokemon,not_removed,wait but nebby never stayed in the bag
pokemon,not_removed,sees bottom of image well this is gonna cause confusion and a bunch of people asking why is this guy naming magnemite after the grasstype captain
pokemon,not_removed,probably because maintenance serebii probably will posted after the maintenance
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i wish theyd promote these more hopefully we wont be the only ones carrying this
pokemon,not_removed,because while its imprecise wonder trade is popular that or they are saving that for a later mission
pokemon,not_removed,nice by the time maintenance was done since i live on the east coast it was kind of late so i didnt have a ton of time to trade too many pokemon but tonight and any free night i have until the end i plan on doing a lot so heres to victory
pokemon,not_removed,festival plaza points
pokemon,not_removed,in festival plaza go inside the castle and talk to the woman at the desk on the right next to the computer shell give you information and you choose to participate there also you need to be signed up and have your game linked through the httpswwwpokemonglcom but once thats done go get to trading
pokemon,not_removed,actually there is something going on called magnemite coil check out the sticky on the front page for more info get magnemite and get ready to trade them all over the place
pokemon,not_removed,gts trades
pokemon,not_removed,dont think so i think its gts trades only
pokemon,not_removed,magnemite coil offer magnemites for magnemites and search for magnemites for magnemites
pokemon,not_removed,ehh the good trades just go more quickly
pokemon,not_removed,i know but i dont have legendaries to give requesting pokémon would still register right as long as the trade actually went through i could be part of the im breeding miniors with close to perfect ivs let the games begin
pokemon,not_removed,thats actually not true at all any trades that are reasonable get traded very quickly trades that are unreasonable are never accepted thus they sit there on the gts forever try depositing your own pokemon instead of searching it is usually more successful given you post a reasonable trade
pokemon,not_removed,ft lvl caterpie fw lv darkrai
pokemon,not_removed,they have a filter for this in gen vi too
pokemon,not_removed,i agree i dont really care about beedrill or mawile but there are some i really want such as diancie and gallade complete my dreamteam i even bred a shiny for it and maybe gardevoir and lopunny if i decide to experiment
pokemon,not_removed,some meme
pokemon,not_removed,were already at complete
pokemon,not_removed,thank you that looks doable
pokemon,not_removed,and rare candy and if we somehow make millions we get a friend ball
pokemon,not_removed,thank you it currently wont let me sign into to my trainer account thing but i think there is just maintenance at the moment edit ive researched this and apparently it is a bug with the website that other people are experiencing too if anyone has any idea how to fix it it would be greatly appreciated
pokemon,not_removed,this would explain why im seeing so many mons get posted for themselves lately
pokemon,not_removed,yeah when i was completing my dex i saw a few pkmn up for trade for something reasonable and by the time id consider the trade and go to my boxes the pokemon was gone on the otherside i put a lvl blastoise up for trade for oranguru and it was gone in minutes
pokemon,not_removed,i completely gave up on using gts since people are fucking ridiculous they want a goddamn level zekrom for a fucking rattata like what the fuck it makes me so angry that i just gave up on it completely really
pokemon,not_removed,i still have celebis and a registeel i cant get rid of because the gts lets you ask for event pokemon but doesnt let you trade them gts says my celebis are special but thats bs because i kept the best of the and leave the other in my trade box they are not special to me at all d
pokemon,not_removed,i can hack in a megastone and trade you just the stone on some low level pokémon of course if you cant get the stones that you want
pokemon,not_removed,worth
pokemon,not_removed,ive been having luck with depositing pokémon and requesting realistic things just have to work around the system a little
pokemon,not_removed,i found out its not that people only request legendaries its that the common senseattainable trades go so damn fast that they disappear almost as soon as they get posted
pokemon,not_removed,options people asking for special pokémon dont include
pokemon,not_removed,if you could hack in diancite and galladite i can send you a legendary in return edit youre only doing released ones then ok
pokemon,not_removed,the hero we need
pokemon,not_removed,was there ever a time when gts was good its in gen right was it usable then cause i know by it was the same as it is now
pokemon,not_removed,ill send them to you once theyre released that way i dont feel guilty if anyone gets banned because of a mega stone i got for them ill definitely give you one but not now
pokemon,not_removed,will this be a giveaway idea ill see what i can do for yall after the first competition see if i can make it a regular thing
pokemon,not_removed,gen gts was half worthless because you had to have a pokémon registered as seen or caught in your pokédex in order to search for it you couldnt just type in the name if you hadnt encountered it yet so dumb
pokemon,not_removed,gen had gts
pokemon,not_removed,ok guess some twit would try to take them online
pokemon,not_removed,it would help a lot of people who cant register on the pgl such as myself or are late to the party when it comes to events
pokemon,not_removed,plus you were limited to results guaranteeing that the youd only see the unreasonable trades unless you heavily the results by species gender and level
pokemon,not_removed,gen is the same i couldnt search for a fricking shellos in x
pokemon,not_removed,thats were it originated had its own building and everything always been pretty bad lmao
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,thats fair enough the sign up happens in midfebruary and the games start late in the month if anyone cant sign up or play games ill host a giveaway for the released mega stones
pokemon,not_removed,oh god id forgotten about that finding a good trade on there really was a miracle
pokemon,not_removed,it was three or five unless youd recently done a trade gen v made it so that youd always get seven provided there were enough people and increased the number of search filters as much of a godsend gen vis gts was at least mythicals could actually be traded on the gen iv and v ones most fucking pointless restriction ever
pokemon,not_removed,you can type the pokemon you want by clicking what pokemon on the bottom of the list
pokemon,not_removed,i just know it was a thing cause the trade evo glitch lol
pokemon,not_removed,they couldnt tell if you had them offline and im not stupid enough to run gallademega on the battle spot so it would have to be someone else
pokemon,not_removed,thats fair but i dont want people to see im giving them out now and then someone else using them and blaming me its only about a month away ill get to them asap once theyre out
pokemon,not_removed,wont it be about a year and a half if they give out two a month
pokemon,not_removed,maybe so ill do one giveaway a month
pokemon,not_removed,you should have used x
pokemon,not_removed,hes quickly becoming my second overall favorite mon the largest sprite ive done yet used over beads and took over hours for it all i used the painters tape method which took a bit longer as i didnt press the tape down hard enough so i had to manually place some beads without the pegboard this led to a few beads not forming together original sprite used httpwwwmypixelpalcom
pokemon,not_removed,i love it amazing work
pokemon,not_removed,damn that looks awesome how much did it cost in total to make it with the pearler beads
pokemon,not_removed,so cool i love everything about this new pokemon d
pokemon,not_removed,ill never be talented
pokemon,not_removed,darn yours does look much better than the one i used maybe ill make a shiny version with your sprite someday
pokemon,not_removed,yours is more detailed but i would say that ops sprite looks more like a sprite you would see in bw as example
pokemon,not_removed,scheisse i was just about to get back into bead sprites and this pixel pal thing is going to be super helpful much better than my old method of using gimp to count pixels
pokemon,not_removed,for bead packs and for beads used different colors so if you wanted to make one like mine youd just need to spend at most
pokemon,not_removed,for me all it took to somewhat get into beadspriting was just getting the basic tools a basic colour palette pegboards and a tweezer plus an iron and paper then you start with copying a few simple things like super mario world powerups as those are not very diverse in colors simple reds amd yellows and then tackle bigger things like pokemon sprites just need some patience to put every one in its place very relaxing hobby now actually creating the sprites is a whole different thing that i hugely respect also op the perler is amazing love it
pokemon,not_removed,yknow i said the same thing a while ago you just have to practice at the thing you want to do it may take a while but you can do it
pokemon,not_removed,you totally have my permission im glad you like it i just started making sprites again after a couple years and this was one of them httpmimgurcomayibsg the second one guy in gold armor was the very last one i did years ago its only there for reference haha
pokemon,not_removed,i found httpwwwhikingdavecomperlerdesignhtm to be pretty useful as well since it tells you how many of each color you need you could also edit any pixel and change bead types to your preference
pokemon,not_removed,oh okay ive wanted to try doing pearler bead art so thank you for the info
pokemon,not_removed,praise the sun
pokemon,not_removed,artorias looks boss as fuck
pokemon,not_removed,ooohhh this one might be better i havent had a huge amount of luck with pixel pal thus far thanks
pokemon,not_removed,iirc magical baby was the localizationtranslation of poket monster franchise in china mainland hongkong and or taiwan whichever allowed imports during the time pokemon was released outside japan so magical baby is acceptable whats not acceptable is carlos wtf carlos
pokemon,not_removed,ahhhh the beautiful carlos region
pokemon,not_removed,according to the bootleg cards eevee is a magic baby actually i cant even argue with that but yeah these look awful also what the hell is that rabbit thing
pokemon,not_removed,wow ive seen some scary bootlegs but this is impressively bad anyone else notice pikachus tail just hanging out down there next to sudowoodo
pokemon,not_removed,lemon is my favorite magic baby of the carlos area
pokemon,not_removed,yeah theres nothing like that in sun and moon
pokemon,not_removed,uhhh whats with the file download
pokemon,not_removed,i was wondering that same thing it doesnt even have a file extension like gif or exe or anything
pokemon,not_removed,i figured it was jynx electabuzz and magmar myself
pokemon,not_removed,i always thought it was the three original eeveelutions
pokemon,not_removed,slowbro is the shit
pokemon,not_removed,my original battle royal team was mimikyu toxapex and ribombee its a solid third as long as you dont mind the shared steel weakness with mimikyu give it a focus sash quiver dance to maximize its effectiveness
pokemon,not_removed,he is but i dont want a second water type i feel like i should spread out the types more
pokemon,not_removed,this is a really cute style
pokemon,not_removed,its waifutastic no really what an adorable humanpoke thingy great job
pokemon,not_removed,cough pokemon crossing cough nintendo pls cough
pokemon,not_removed,twist its a boy

pokemon,not_removed,nah i want to play as my character for pokemon games the whole controlling another character thing worked for pmd but i cant see it working here i dont want to loose access to my team
pokemon,not_removed,would be interesting and maybe a kinda cool way for them to let you play around with pokemon that you wont be able to actually obtain until later in the game id be up for it
pokemon,not_removed,id love it if there were two or maybe three but i think two would be enough characters you could freely customize and play at any time during the story both would have their own teams youd build all by yourself and there would be moments in the story when the game would require controlling character a or character b for some time
pokemon,not_removed,so kinda like some of the segments of pmd explorers of sky sounds kinda cool
pokemon,not_removed,it would only be for a short segment at best
pokemon,not_removed,still personally not wild about the idea for me to enjoy it it would have to be executed like explorers of sky did optional side missions that can be started and stopped whenever
pokemon,not_removed,i feel like the pokemon world tournament should return with them all in it
pokemon,not_removed,its called a critical capture
pokemon,not_removed,its a critical capture httpwwwserebiinetgamescaptureshtml
pokemon,not_removed,critical capture the chance of them increases as you catch more pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,and the next step you take you encounter a wild pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,no made it out fine
pokemon,not_removed,thats so cute ps i recently found out that you can remove the prisma watermark in the app settings
pokemon,not_removed,id love to see the original love the art
pokemon,not_removed,i actually posted it on here before haha
pokemon,not_removed,side note buy a new charger
pokemon,not_removed,eh probably not if theyre bad quality card tears cracking fading general wear and tear which is why many people sleeve cards these days
pokemon,not_removed,collector and tcg professor here im bored so ill look through the cards to see if you have anything of value here ie more than dollars give me a bit though im going to need to zoom into that photo heres the list base set mewtwo about bucks the salamance ex cards would typically be worth something but from the image those look to be in sub pair condition the holo enery are worth about bucks kingdra ex is about bucks if the dark charizard is the holo is around bucks other than that everything else is just bulk commons and some random holo rares which arent worth more than a dollar or two
pokemon,not_removed,thanks man
pokemon,not_removed,well whatever is in that direction is dead now
pokemon,not_removed,this is my favorite character and team pic so far mainly just because the character looks pretty normal but still nice
pokemon,not_removed,awesome i love the dynamic poses did you have rowlet or litten as your starter
pokemon,not_removed,golisopod good choice
pokemon,not_removed,great art style also partial for acknowledging that half of this sub is currently doing that hahaha
pokemon,not_removed,oh wow that looks amazing great job op
pokemon,not_removed,you picked incineroar and crabominableyoure a wonderfull man great drawing btw love the dynamic
pokemon,not_removed,i wish i was that good at drawing great job
pokemon,not_removed,who is the one on the far left
pokemon,not_removed,looks amazing i wish i could draw that well im already pretty great at hand drawn things but digitally i can barely draw a circle xp
pokemon,not_removed,some awesome pokemon there and also incineroar
pokemon,not_removed,pretty amazing i had almost the exact same team as you but had kommoo instead of incineroar
pokemon,not_removed,this is so fcking epic
pokemon,not_removed,very awesome pic and team and we share of our team decidueye a raichu crabominable golisopod switch incineroar and lycanroc for turtonator and a muk so i definitely think youve got a winning lineup there
pokemon,not_removed,i really like this angle some people draw it head on and not in action but this looks really alive great job
pokemon,not_removed,i have the same ingame team
pokemon,not_removed,how do you guys deal with golisopods emergency exit i got him to level and ended up dumping him for araquanid because the fucker just couldnt take a hit im just playing through storyline
pokemon,not_removed,well i enjoyed my team until i had to fight hapu having half my team weak to ground and the other half underleveled was not fun
pokemon,not_removed,wow do you do commissions this is amazing
pokemon,not_removed,its soo goood why must everything i do be outdone by someone else googolfold
pokemon,not_removed,i love this but going further i looked at your related artwork that lillie tribute was gorgeous her character really resonates with me and i love your rendition of her afterduring the ending my favorite ending to any pokémon title
pokemon,not_removed,oh wow you have literally the exact same team as me except i used marowak instead of decidueye nice art too
pokemon,not_removed,i always get a little jealous when i see these because they make me want to see my own team in one but i dont draw three of those are on my team though so its close enough d
pokemon,not_removed,you chose decidueye and incineroar yet no primarina other than that little tidbit great team
pokemon,not_removed,its the squad needed to get nebby back in the back
pokemon,not_removed,thanks i tried to make it resemble myself according to the ingame outfit i had
pokemon,not_removed,rowlet hes one of my favourite pokemon of all time now the entire line i still loved incineroar though so i couldnt turn down using one
pokemon,not_removed,i struggled to find a sixth team member and got wimpod on a whim golisopod ended up being one of my mvps
pokemon,not_removed,thanks i had to jump on the bandwagon too even if this pic is a little old now
pokemon,not_removed,thank you
pokemon,not_removed,im glad you think so d thanks
pokemon,not_removed,i can say that about many other artists too as long as you keep practicing you can be as good as you want
pokemon,not_removed,thats decidueye
pokemon,not_removed,just takes practice ive been using a tablet for over years now and im still trying to perfect the technique
pokemon,not_removed,hey dont shit on my boys any of them t
pokemon,not_removed,i had strongly considered using one of those too but getting it so late on made me decide not to
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i was surprised too
pokemon,not_removed,thank you
pokemon,not_removed,hahaha i agree with that
pokemon,not_removed,if i were better i wouldve loved to do something a bit more dynamic with perspective but this is the limit of my abilities right now thanks
pokemon,not_removed,great minds think alike
pokemon,not_removed,he was pretty bulky for me so it didnt get triggered too much unintentionally abusing first impression with him is the best way to go i think
pokemon,not_removed,i dont currently have my commissions open but yes i do them if youre interested and have a deviantarttumblr account ill most likely post on either of those two when i have them open again httpryairyaideviantartcom httpryaitumblrcom
pokemon,not_removed,listen dude ive just had a few drinks and im a bit sentimental but you just have to keep working there is thousands of artists better than me out there and i feel the exact same way you just have to stay on your own path and work your hardest and youll get to a point where you can be happy with your work acknowledge that your work isnt where you want it to be but dont beat yourself up just because other people are further along the path than you are in this particular moment in time everyone progresses at different speeds have a good year
pokemon,not_removed,im really happy you think so i really tried to capture the feeling of the end of the game
pokemon,not_removed,i absolutely loved using this set of pokemon im sure you did too
pokemon,not_removed,i used to feel the same way it took a long time for me to be able to draw my teams in a way that satisfied me id love to do a few more team pics like this some day but theyre pretty difficult and tedious
pokemon,not_removed,it was based on my regret of not picking froakie as my starter for x i chose fennekin and grew to like the froakie line more despite still loving using fennekin so i decided this gen so i just used two because i loved them so much instead of fretting over it dont worry i still think the whole popplio line is fantastic i just wanted to give the other pokemon a shot too if i end up playing again ill pick popplio
pokemon,not_removed,back in the back
pokemon,not_removed,rnebbyinthebag as is tradition every pokemon discussion on reddit inevitably contains a link there if it goes on long enough
pokemon,not_removed,i guess you got it on a whimpod ayyyyyyyyyyy
pokemon,not_removed,whats bad is im actually a senior art major haha i enjoy the idea of drawing but dont enjoy the task im a graphic design major so i usually just draw quick little sketches to clear my thoughts but the finished work is done digitally
pokemon,not_removed,i see it now oops right on great job
pokemon,not_removed,i wish i had my own drawing tablet to use i only can practice digitally on my pokemon art academy
pokemon,not_removed,i just got one from the gta during the island
pokemon,not_removed,like what references did you use to draw this
pokemon,not_removed,gotcha i havent bothered with any breeding or anything like that yet so none of my guys have ideal nature ivs or anything like that i figured id beat the elite to get access to everything then complete pokedex then hatch everyone and train from scratch i didnt like my mareanie that much either and i played through most of the game with a salamence but i like doing super effective moves rather than just having a really powerful tank that doesnt get super effective moves done to him similarly i had crabrawler for a while but i dont want to bother with crabonimable got rid of my magneton for raichu as well ill have to see how it turns out
pokemon,not_removed,thanks man
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i cried a lot everybodys all lillie is best girl but i genuinely felt attached to her something about her character just sucked me in and found its way into my heart her backstory her design her visible transition into independence and selfconfidence it all felt like the connection to a character i always wanted from pokémon a character so lovable and wellwritten you couldnt help but feel for himher i feel like lillie nailed that for me and in a game with so many other strongly written and designed supporting characters lillie is hands down my favorite character in the franchise and she as well as all the other unforgettable faces you meet in alola made sun tied for my favorite game in the franchise i only hope she returns someday in another title or the sequel to sunmoon if she doesnt i may just be beside myself shes too cool to be gone forever so thats why i appreciate your piece it rocks keep up the good work man tldr lillie is the best thanks for capturing the bittersweetness of her arcs conclusion it means a lot to me i bet im not alone
pokemon,not_removed,oh
pokemon,not_removed,back to back
pokemon,not_removed,thats what happens when you stay up till
pokemon,not_removed,listen here u little shit
pokemon,not_removed,a winpod
pokemon,not_removed,were in the same boat then im also in my final year of a design course at uni but i really have no passion for graphic design and prefer drawing instead haha
pokemon,not_removed,thank you
pokemon,not_removed,you can get some for some pretty affordable prices that work excellently like the basic wacom intuos tablets you should save up and buy one
pokemon,not_removed,i love catching my own pokemon though feels nicer to me in a sense obviously couldnt do it for litten though
pokemon,not_removed,none really just the model references to see how the pokemon looked and how my ingame character looked its a bad habit of mines not to find pose references i just kind of chip at them till they look right
pokemon,not_removed,golisopod isnt so much a tank as a revenge killer hes very similar to scizor is that respect he relies on priority moves and recovery from leech life whats interesting is that you can leave him in longer than you normally would because of emergency exit
pokemon,not_removed,screw the bag you need a box to hold solgaleo cats love boxes
pokemon,not_removed,no u
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i think i might as well thanks for the advice
pokemon,not_removed,what is the price range on good drawing tablet
pokemon,not_removed,its not a bad habit it makes your art more original also how long did it take to draw this i might do this sometime in the future so i wanna know final question i think what drawing program did you use painttool sai
pokemon,not_removed,no u
pokemon,not_removed,no problem
pokemon,not_removed,honestly anything from around up as long as its from wacom thats the only tablets ive ever used another brand that ive heard good things about is huion but i cant say anything about them personally
pokemon,not_removed,if i had to estimate id say somewhere between hours not in one sitting over the course of two days also i use clip studio paint it goes on sale fairly frequently for around £ about for pro and it is such a massive improvement from sai which i had used for years before switching over
pokemon,not_removed,i wanna try it im not good at drawing but i enjoy it i took a course in digital arts and i enjoyed it
pokemon,not_removed,ok thanks i thought it wouldve taken you a much longer time though
pokemon,not_removed,you dont have to be good to have fun as long as you dont beat yourself up about it drawing for the sake of drawing is very relaxing
pokemon,not_removed,ive always been a person who rushed my art to the extreme it has had its pros and cons for example i can usually do any pic in way less time than people would expect but they always end up a bit messier too because of it i lose interest in pictures if i cant finish them in one or two sittings
pokemon,not_removed,just like video games xd
pokemon,not_removed,ok
pokemon,not_removed,exactly d
pokemon,not_removed,why do i get the feeling that renders will be the next trend to get banned here
pokemon,not_removed,thanks to ucosmiclandshark for all your help
pokemon,not_removed,such a beauty awesome job my dude
pokemon,not_removed,how long did it take to make how would you go about fixing the larvitars eyes
pokemon,not_removed,cool what software did you use for this
pokemon,not_removed,you made this in blender right might want to turn up the render settings to full looks grainy otherwise looks good
pokemon,not_removed,dont forget for ripping the models out of the game unfortunately he doesnt have reddit not that i could find anyways so i cant do a u mention
pokemon,not_removed,looks good
pokemon,not_removed,the model for larvitar was mapped with a couple of mistakes the eye textures being one of them
pokemon,not_removed,its shedding
pokemon,not_removed,thanks man
pokemon,not_removed,id have to go into edit mode and basically push the vertices of the eyes inwards i might try to make it flush later on
pokemon,not_removed,blender
pokemon,not_removed,will do im basically finding stuff out as i come across it with this program
pokemon,not_removed,i was more so referring to what happens usually one type of post becomes popular and everyone posts similar content to get karma people complain about said type of post flooding the subreddit and the mods ban it because of the complaints
pokemon,not_removed,i approve of your flair mate
pokemon,not_removed,damn all mine does is mix things im joking i dont have a blender
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i find that kind of mod action annoying as well not nearly so bad as what i was talking about but still a power i fewl like they should use a lot less and only only ever as a temporary thing to deal with floods of posts on a given day or week
pokemon,not_removed,is it easier to grow berries in xy i always struggled to keep track and prunetake care of my trees in xy and in oras just used the berry masters field to water them once maybe twice and get a solid berry return
pokemon,not_removed,i think it would be cool if you had your own decisions to make rather than being led to everything like once you make a decision you cant go back and you have to ride it out and have to play again to make a different decision or multiple save slots that would be bad ass
pokemon,not_removed,i would love a global marketplace imagine what people would put the price of rare candies tho
pokemon,not_removed,personally i would love an item bank addon for pokemon bank it solves the big issue of transferring items between games you own while making it harder to tank the economy by throwing of master balls or ability capsules on the trade network
pokemon,not_removed,xy has the one big field oras has the berries spread out
pokemon,not_removed,railroading can be annoying and multiple save slots should be common sense by now only having one still is a bit odd
pokemon,not_removed,wasnt one of the main reasons for single save files to maintain scarcityprestige of rare pokemon disregarding all of the illegitimate ways to get a pokemon if you could have even two save files you would have access to an unlimited supply of every pokemon you have you could trade the mew from one file for an arceus then transfer the arceus to your other file where you still have mew
pokemon,not_removed,it would only work if the games were completely hackproof so long as people can add everything to their bag give themselves event items etc then its all worthless as far as the market is concerned
pokemon,not_removed,there are things that are worth far more than rare candies
pokemon,not_removed,gamefreak could also use fixed prices or a price cap to prevent unreasonable inflation
pokemon,not_removed,the route east of mauville has the berry master house or something isnt that a good enough place for planting berries
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i know theres the big field but i thought the mechanics in xy were a little harder
pokemon,not_removed,its a surprisingly primitive limitation for this day and age there is no good reason for this
pokemon,not_removed,gf wants your
pokemon,not_removed,yeah didnt think of that
pokemon,not_removed,yes i know but i dont think that they would allow master balls to be sold
pokemon,not_removed,true true
pokemon,not_removed,at this point its a design choice i cant remember where it was from but i think it was said that they thought it encouraged the feeling of a personal adventure not sure i agree but there you go
pokemon,not_removed,not so much a limitation as it is a way to sell more games two saves slots one game among two siblings while one save slot two games among two siblings
pokemon,not_removed,there are things that are worth far more than master balls
pokemon,not_removed,in other words one game per file is like buying extra files for the price of another game its for profit
pokemon,not_removed,i believe it was on the same conference where they revealed noivern
pokemon,not_removed,i kind of think part of it has to do with grinding a lot of legendaries from multiple saves they wouldnt be so unique arguably they arent anyway these days
pokemon,not_removed,i suppose thats true but youre still limited in that scheme because you then cant trade with your sibling if both slots are same cartridge plus you also couldnt play concurrently with eachother which i always did growing up with my best friend i think those are enough incentive that people would still each want their own gamepak
pokemon,not_removed,isnt that what multiple versions are for
pokemon,not_removed,ability capsule cant think of much else enigma berry is pretty easy to find on gts or wondertrade breeding and training items are easy to find and everything else you get a free one in every game and thats the only one you ever need
pokemon,not_removed,the things that let you change ivs
pokemon,not_removed,but this can already be done in the same amount of time wo the bank catch it bank it rinse repeat
pokemon,not_removed,interesting points as well
pokemon,not_removed,that was more for two games and two systems for the lonely gamer who doesnt like talking to other people
pokemon,not_removed,doesnt mean they dont want to make even more money p
pokemon,not_removed,the eon ticket maybe
pokemon,not_removed,sure but a lot of people dont want to lose their main saves at least applies to me and a lot of people who i know we have collectively bought a few extra copies of oras to get the legendaries
pokemon,not_removed,can you transfer eon tickets as it is i thought you could only streetpass or use a code to get it
pokemon,not_removed,i dont like to lose my main save either but the bank has made it easier i will probably never reset my or though first game i finished the dex and i was able to pretty easily get other version legendaries through gts so while i couldnt catch them myself i still got them
pokemon,not_removed,honestly i dont like the artificial scarcity of legendaries itd be great if theyre all catchable so i appreciate what oras did making most of them available
pokemon,not_removed,dope as hell really dig it
pokemon,not_removed,ive loved robezs music for ages glad others are enjoying it too
pokemon,not_removed,im a fan of httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvaerfzoszdeo of the lake theme

pokemon,not_removed,talonflame venusaur delphox greninja lucario and raichu this was my gen team i hadhave when i finally got pokemon bank they were also used time and time again post game to get to lvl let me tell you something venusaur is a bitch to get to level without rare candies
pokemon,not_removed,i build my team based on role i have a scout noivern a status absorber roserade a physical softener arcanine a general wall a setup sweeper gyarados and a dancer oricorio
pokemon,not_removed,i tend to take along my mega mewtwo x on a lot of teams most commonly tagging my alomomola harocky helmet weavile sigilyph magic guardflame orb chesnaught haleftovers and sylveon boldcute charmlife orb alongside it youd be surprised what a bunch of trading and breeding over months can do

pokemon,not_removed,im a hoenn person kyogre claydol camerupt flygon cacturne magnezone
pokemon,not_removed,my favorite battling team thus far is tyranitar garchomp chandelure galvantula ninetales alolan so much fun to use it
pokemon,not_removed,blaziken mega greninja talonflamepalossand jolteontapu koko aegislash hitmontopincineroar had to edit my team for alola so thats why there are pokemon in one slot

pokemon,not_removed,this is my favorite team for emerald blaziken sharpedo bellossom skarmory manectric and flygon
pokemon,not_removed,rock and ground types always find a way into my team mostly more then other then that its always a water starter and keeping the regional bird except swellow returning pokes in different games kadabra magmar aggron and ampharos
pokemon,not_removed,i love smallcute pokémon and i always have whimsicott and flareon in my team them being my favorites design wise now that i have a shiny for both in sun im definitely keeping them forever i also prefer doubles than singles the rest of my team consists of alolan marowak ribombee and mega mawile whimsicott acts as the earlygame or lategame prankster depending on which format im using shes not meant to last very long after tailwind is up flareon doesnt last very long either since shell mostly be flare blitzing with a choice band shes used to punch holes in the enemy team earlygame to maximize her potential alolan marowak will activate her flash fire ability allowing her to ohko most pokémon who dont have resistance to fire hes also there to fuck up tapu kokos is the fat duck fat duck is great acts as an endgame special attacker ribombee is the healer shes able to help flareon stay in the fight longer if needed acts as a special attacker if needed last but not least mega mawile is the lategame physical sweeper and pseudotank hits hard harder than flareon and alolan marowak also really cute mega arguably cutest mega great against filthy tapus and droggos
pokemon,not_removed,that is a damn solid team
pokemon,not_removed,i never thought id meet someone else using alolan raticate
pokemon,not_removed,i might need to give this build a try has a couple of my faves in there
pokemon,not_removed,no wonder i might have to try that team
pokemon,not_removed,i enjoy using hyper offense with mons that people dont usually like
pokemon,not_removed,and im not sure you ever will
pokemon,not_removed,its a good idea i think ive always picked the least popular starter i have thing for those who show potential haha
pokemon,not_removed,wow i completely misread that i need more sleep and less hope
pokemon,not_removed,if you havent already give special toxicroak a try catches a lot of players off guard and has awesome sweep potential if you can set it up
pokemon,not_removed,you click on take a break when youve finished a battle then save
pokemon,not_removed,you can unless you maybe turned it off too soon when you reselect super singles it will continue
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i need to delete this it acted like i was starting newbut i just found out i was on battle the game was clearly deceptive
pokemon,not_removed,hahaha good luck getting to
pokemon,not_removed,thankslost on eye roll
pokemon,not_removed,hahahahahaha
pokemon,not_removed,getting a wrong answer pretty much does nothing except giving you the chance to choose again so you can get through it just by trial and error as many puzzles are done in a bunch of videogames
pokemon,not_removed,i did think this they could have easily done something like sophocles saying we need to get through some locks hows your hearing and if you say not good he could reply with no problem ill handle the audio side theres another unlocking system here and then you perform some sort of visual quiz anagrams or the sort
pokemon,not_removed,you are overexerating on the trial you can easily trial and error it and it will only take you maybe seconds longer than someone who isnt deaf
pokemon,not_removed,i played most of the game with the sound off since i usually play on the couch next to my wife while we netflix that trial takes like tries total without playing the sound still its not great for deaf people they should have had an optional deaf mode and a colorblind mode while were at it
pokemon,not_removed,he was understandably pretty shaken up about it that is not understandable unless hes a child had this been an issue making it impossible to pass id agree but you literally just have to choose more options with no penalty
pokemon,not_removed,its an unfortunate oversight but considering how simple it is to guess at least it doesnt make the game unplayable not sure if theyll fix it at least not unless someone points it out to them which id consider unlikely
pokemon,not_removed,i mean theres no penalty for getting it wrong so to me it seems like they made it and mid way through realised it would be impossible for deaf players so made it unlosable it seems like a complaint for the sake of complaining
pokemon,not_removed,oh wow how they would tackle that issue is interesting could there be an alternative trial i have no idea
pokemon,not_removed,a friend didnt even bother turning on the sound for his ds for the trial and managed fine is it a mild inconvenience sure but hardly a large barrier the totem trials are mostly jokes anyway
pokemon,not_removed,complaints like this feel like such a world problem i cleared the trial w the sound off since i was watching a movie at the time people really shouldnt complain about stuff like this it was a cool little puzzle which just makes the people who listen to it appreciate the sounds in the game a little more and shouldnt create to much of a hassle for people who cant i know you probably just wanted to bring it up for the sake of discussion but some stuff should just be appreciated for what they are
pokemon,not_removed,and here i thought this one was completely unique and enjoyable because it did something way different than press a on the object or answer the truefalse made for an year old oh well
pokemon,not_removed,id say theres no real point in saying anything here but try to get word out to gf so they have feedback for next time
pokemon,not_removed,i totally agree that its an unfortunate oversight that should have been caught but the examples you are providing arent even a little bit close to the same thing
pokemon,not_removed,which trial was that
pokemon,not_removed,you literally cant get through the trial without being able to hear oh then how did i stop fucking overreacting you just want pity this challenge is not a problem in any way you literally have to click max two more times to get the answer right and theres no penalty for choosing wrong
pokemon,not_removed,it is disheartening to see the people commenting on here how it is no big deal if you are someone with the ability to hear then please keep degrading comments to yourself you are not capable of understanding the daily struggles deaf people go through just try to be supportive
pokemon,not_removed,im deaf and i got through the trial in maybe minutes had weak mons its not that hard and everyone in the comments bitching about how it insults deaf people is stupid its not a hard trial and requires no effort
pokemon,not_removed,yeah at least its not randomised each time maybe thats how it got past qa
pokemon,not_removed,how they would tackle that issue is interesting you could bring the option to choose between a sound quiz and a silhouette quiz where you see the pokemons outlines and need to say what it is would have been like of extra work to do a couple ifs
pokemon,not_removed,yeah the complaints of the disabled are first world problems how dare deaf people want to be able to play a visually based game with minimal intrusion by things they actually cannot do you are a hearing person clearly so you saying that not being able to hear it shouldnt be much of a hassle is really ignorant and completely disregards that even if its an easy trial to get through its still stressful in a way that it should not be
pokemon,not_removed,wow what a stretch daily struggles is a separate thing but a single trial in a pokemon game isnt especially since there is an alternative method of solving the puzzle without hearing
pokemon,not_removed,theyre basically saying the same thing as a person in a wheelchair doesnt need a ramp to go to the grocery store because they already have some groceries or its okay if a blind person cant see something important because they wont know its important if they dont see it i understand that the trial can be done without the sound via trial and error but that doesnt negate that the game doesnt tell you that the stress of thinking shit i might not be able to actually get past this part because i cant actually hear is not a little thing its a big deal even if the outcome is the same for everyone there is no precedent in pokemon for thinking you can get past a trivia trial while getting the answers incorrect none
pokemon,not_removed,even something as simple as that is at least several extra days work for a couple of staff members though i agree that the solution shouldve been there
pokemon,not_removed,how on earth is that stressful people in this threat make it more of a problem than it is its not more stressful to guess the answer if you cant hear than if you can hear but have the sound off
pokemon,not_removed,going to play a game is one small part of the daily struggles im not implying that this incident is in fact their daily struggle it is a compilation of things that remind them in their every day lives that they live in a hearinggeared world i dont consider guess until you get it right as an alternative method
pokemon,not_removed,no those are not at all the same not being able to get into a grocery store is completely different from having to spend less than a minute guessing answers if you are deaf you are at worst slightly inconvenience by this trial for everyone else its a neat new challenge as far as no precedent goes look up the last electric gym lumiose city wrong answers there did not impede your progress wrong answers in any pokemon game generally do not impede progress as far as i can tell because the games are made for children the only counter example i can think of is the password in which you need to enter from a full keyboard
pokemon,not_removed,exactly it is simply the constant reminder that they unfortunately live in a world where people dont care about their disability
pokemon,not_removed,yeah it would have been more work for sure but at least your game would have been more friendly towards people who arent able to listen to the sounds or you could have done a completely different trial if the theme was electricity we could have had a couple switches to turn energy barriers off and on doesnt matter now game is done
pokemon,not_removed,spoken by someone that can hear its a reminder that the world wasnt made for the deaf and that if we have inconveniences in the world that they arent important plenty of comments explain how this is stressful but you were very successful in ignoring them because you can hear and it doesnt affect you also if you are playing with the sound off you could turn it on the deaf cant turn their hearing on
pokemon,not_removed,but the quiz itself is about guessing
pokemon,not_removed,guessing is a completely reasonable alternative especially when it is so short thats just life sometimes when you have a disability the alternative doesnt have to be which it cant actually be its similar to using a ramp vs using stairs the ramp takes longer but it still allows access this is just an example and isnt really a core concept though
pokemon,not_removed,if you are deaf you are at worst slightly inconvenience by this trial bbbut muh minutes s
pokemon,not_removed,not really you are exposed to most if not all of the sounds before and during the trial this also isnt the point at all you are missing it
pokemon,not_removed,im not speaking sjwim speaking i have a disability and youre disregarding my opinion because it inconveniences your feelings
pokemon,not_removed,but you can literally just do trial and error for minutes and youll be fine lmao
pokemon,not_removed,i will never not be pissed that luvdisc doesnt evolve into fucking alomomola
pokemon,not_removed,i dunno mega evolution gastlyhaunter or some such
pokemon,not_removed,sing it with me kids if you want to be possessive its its but if you want it to be a contraction its itapostrophes scallywag
pokemon,not_removed,came here to say this folks would luv the disc a lot better this way also butterfree venomoth sprite swap
pokemon,not_removed,i still dont see the resemblance outside of reaching

pokemon,not_removed,i want to say snorlax
pokemon,not_removed,knights and ladies gallade bisharp escavalier gardevoir lilligant florges food farfetchd vanilluxe slurpuff cherubi tropius heat rotom
pokemon,not_removed,rattata sentret zigzagoon bidoof patrat and bunnelby dont even evolve them the top percentage team
pokemon,not_removed,forgotten pokemon finneon slugma maractus mothim glameow and corsola or any pokemon that you have never used or forgotten that it existed
pokemon,not_removed,ah ive been toying around with the concept of a fantastic hair team so probably with pokemon like mega ampharos suicune whimsicott furfrou elemental monkeys etc i should really get on making the team there are just so many good options
pokemon,not_removed,forget bouffalant go with tauros great plains also add fraligater american alligator deep south crawdaunt lobster northeast magnezone ufo roswell southwest sawsbuck elk or deer rocky mountains rotom heat chicago style pizza midwest
pokemon,not_removed,accelgor is more of a ninja than a knight what about escavalier
pokemon,not_removed,thats who i was thinking of theyre counterparts so i get them mixed up easily

pokemon,not_removed,if youll notice the only picture of the male veteran trainer from blackwhite is a rip of his sprite
pokemon,not_removed,zygarde has anywhere between and attack i mean not really a big discovery but thanks
pokemon,not_removed,i congratulate you for doing such amount of calculations y
pokemon,not_removed,well those are the most extreme possibilities taking the simple mean would equal to attack but its more likely to have been two pokemon with no investment and zygarde attack being about
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i agree we need a third stage to phanpy or maybe mega donphan because a mega donphan would be badass as fuck also why the fuck does noctowl not have psychic type i always thought it was psychic type up until just now it can learn nine psychic moves up to gen vi but is normalflying type i just dont get that
pokemon,not_removed,unfortunately the whole point of farfetchd is that he is incredibly lame a duck served with its own garnishment which is sad because i love just how silly he is but itd be like giving stunfisk a mega
pokemon,not_removed,i highly doubt gyarados would get an alolan form since it has a mega
pokemon,not_removed,the read we dont have auto save is for soft resetting
pokemon,not_removed,i know right it always messed with me when i would have my noctowl go against a fighting type only to get serious damage because of its normal type status lol
pokemon,not_removed,gen did a couple of odd things in order to whack psychic with a good old nerf bat
pokemon,not_removed,an evolved form wouldnt need to be lame though im just trying to convince myself lol
pokemon,not_removed,yeah its too bad though like i get they want to spend time on new pokes and maybe some that are under loved but still

pokemon,not_removed,team plasma and team skull themes
pokemon,not_removed,that was my favorite song when i felt edgy loved it as a kid
pokemon,not_removed,how does pokemon even work in the this has to be some scifi alternate stuff also it says theres like comments in the thread but only op shows up
pokemon,not_removed,wait i have to fill out an application to play on a server theres plenty of good servers to join just by clicking and if theres a no deny policy then why the applications
pokemon,not_removed,we got permission to selfadvertise every weeks
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i saw this thread earlier and it had a couple unkind but possibly not untrue comments they mustve gotten the mods to remove them which honestly kinda turns me off the server
pokemon,not_removed,because we will never deny an application we just wanna make sure people know what theyre doing on the server and an application is a good introduction to the server as we said but thats just to cover basic rules and character creation we just want to make sure people know whats going on and that they have well written character that fit well in the toro region if you have any other questions please ask
pokemon,not_removed,please dont
pokemon,not_removed,theyre having comments remove because they werent kind what kind of space safe sjw stuff is this even if theyre unkind they can just downvote and move on or reply to the dudes
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i dont know if thats the exact reason but i saw this and i thought it was cool so i ear marked it but i came back and the comments had just vanished one said it was autistic and the other was something about year olds i cant remember too well
pokemon,not_removed,im not trying to be mean event though it does come off this way i just dont want to see something posted every weeks 😅
pokemon,not_removed,this whole thing just sounds kind of weird now and kind of crappy if theyre having the mods remove comments they dont agree with
pokemon,not_removed,yeah idk man maybe theyll see these comments and clear it up
pokemon,not_removed,maybe i guess well see
pokemon,not_removed,hey yeah sorry for not getting to these sooner to explain some people left some rather destructive and rude comments as you saw on our post and thus we did have them removed by the moderators we reported the comments mentioned not because they were unkind but rather because they were obvious attempts of trolling and have no valid criticism one of the users even had no other posts besides the one calling the server autistic they were then removed because the subforum mods mustve agreed we apologize for any confusion this caused
pokemon,not_removed,i checked for him in the pokedex as soon as i got it why cant he just register himself
pokemon,not_removed,from what i understand the rotom dex isnt a new thing so theyve obviously met plenty of rotoms before the only reason i can think of is if the rotoms are imported from another region so theyre not present in the dex because its only species local to alola if thats the case why isnt charizard in there i get lifts from them all the time same reason maybe but still p
pokemon,not_removed,the way i rationalize charizard is that it belongs to kiawe he has one in the anime as well
pokemon,not_removed,its best selling game
pokemon,not_removed,i think pokemon go definitely helped out here that and rby being released on the virtual console got people out buying
pokemon,not_removed,havent they outsold xy too i think they sold million units
pokemon,not_removed,usually a remake does not surpass in sales the new games of a new generation and it is to be expected but to wait if sm surpasses xy
pokemon,not_removed,i think oras were great and had a lot of really great lore revelations conceptsi really miss soaring and probably ranked high on nostalgia value for a lot of people last year though being the anniversary celebration and with go and the fanfare around that i think it just was the perfect storm for the start of generation
pokemon,not_removed,makes me happy to see so many people enjoying pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,breaking into the top is gonna be rough for any game i think sunmoon can do it if it gets a second wind i think this puts it at for most sales might be wrong but without a version i dont think it can catch up to gen ivs million which is currently the third best selling gen and no pokemon will ever catch up to rbyrse
pokemon,not_removed,yet people still say it is a crap game i am having a great time
pokemon,not_removed,and so fast too this is a complete success
pokemon,not_removed,is an article about this including sales numbers for all the main series games
pokemon,not_removed,outselling oras doesnt really mean much the first games in a new generation always outsell the third versions sequels and remakes its too early to tell how it stacks up with the other main series games that are the flagships of their generations but the hot selling period is already over between the initial release and the holiday season
pokemon,not_removed,still much less than diamondpearlplatinum
pokemon,not_removed,not surprising the remake games dont sell that much units compared to the entry games
pokemon,not_removed,wow im really surprised smash isnt a few places higher
pokemon,not_removed,the list for the wii u is really sad
pokemon,not_removed,wow tomodachi life outsold oot and mm
pokemon,not_removed,for now
pokemon,not_removed,just needs to overcome x and y
pokemon,not_removed,im shocked that sun and moon sold that much in such a short amount of time just incredible lifetime sales can hit million and come close to the crazy number they used to have im excited too more salesmore games
pokemon,not_removed,i agree even on this subreddit ive seen so many people who played pokemon go and decided to get back into pokemon for the first time since childhood if you noticed prices of the pokemon games no longer in print skyrocketed after pokemon go so no matter what you think of pokemon go you gotta give it credit for bringing back so many people
pokemon,not_removed,yeah im still hesitant to believe go had much to do with it the crowd that went along for the go ride is not the same crowd willing to spend on game and console plus consider how many of those people quit go once the hype died sure it helped a little bit but not nearly as much as you might be thinking at least not compared to pokemons improved marketing strategy when it came to trailer content and releases edit some wonderful anecdotes here but doesnt really say much for example none of my goplaying friends bought a ds nor would they ever in a million years but im not basing it off that the is expensive and pokemon go is free thats really all im saying
pokemon,not_removed,xy has million copies sold and is game
pokemon,not_removed,its
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure ddpt sold more than rse actually
pokemon,not_removed,thats an odd way of spelling redblue
pokemon,not_removed,and dppt is still much less than rgby so what
pokemon,not_removed,it competes with itself in another console the wiiu version and it still only lost to mario pokemon and one ac it also outsold melee long ago already and is even more recent than xy im surprised that monster hunter is not up there actually
pokemon,not_removed,i never even considered smash on it would feel weird to play and im scared id break the circle pad lol
pokemon,not_removed,in my anecdotal experience smash lost a lot of people when they made it more casualfriendly after melee all of my friends that would get together to play melee tried brawl but quickly went back to melee and havent really touched the newer games
pokemon,not_removed,you should check out the list for wii it always surprised me how much wii sports sold maybe its cause it came bundled with the system maybe its cause its used in hospitals for motor rehab idk but units sold seems absurd its a shame the wii u didnt have a record breaker like that
pokemon,not_removed,to be fair theres a ton of versions of oot
pokemon,not_removed,it was originally a japan exclusive series tomodachi collection the first game so some people were probably dying to try it plus it got a lot of recognition from vinny from vinesauce playing it a hell of a lot though that probably only accounted for half a million to a million still there are things that account to it and as uicalasari mentioned oot and mm on the are remakes
pokemon,not_removed,i agree my friend who enjoys gens so a i guess is seriously considering getting a and either sun or moon i am doing all i can to persuade him he also wants to get back on the go hype
pokemon,not_removed,yes theres no doubt about it still the worst pokemon game ever imo but thats neither here nor there
pokemon,not_removed,i think im in the small group who stayed playing go until it got too cold to go out then full out bought a copy of sun with a i had never played pokemon prior to pokemon go
pokemon,not_removed,did a whole bunch of people drop go yeah but a crapton of people kept playing it outside of the people that played it because of the fad the second largest group to drop it was probably diehard fans of the franchise ive read story after story of people who hadnt played since gen or that picked up a and games purely because go reignited their passion for the series smartphone users tend to spend hundreds every year or so on a new phone mobile gamers spend lots of money on games through microtransactions the fact that they a have this capital and b are willing to spend it isnt out of the question the trailer content doesnt do anything to bring people in
pokemon,not_removed,i dunno i know three people who did more or less exactly this after being avid go players all summer
pokemon,not_removed,nintendo published data showing sales spiking the immediate months after go came out it definitely made a big impact on sunmoon sales
pokemon,not_removed,ive been a pokemon fan almost all my life having played the tcg watching anime reading manga but pogo got me to buy a ds and moon
pokemon,not_removed,the crowd that went along for the go ride is not the same crowd willing to spend on game and console with the sample size of people that played goyou cant just go on and say that the crowd that played go aint the crowd thats gonna shell money this the sample size is just way too big remember that go was big enough to help skyrocket nintendos stock and somewhere a long there will be a considerable amount of people who helped sun and moon sales unrelated to your comment it also doesnt hurt that the reviews were mostly positive this is why in oras altho a good score by igns metrics was detrimental to the games sales ign as a big gaming review site knew exactly that the largely influenced a buy or no buy for many potential customers
pokemon,not_removed,the thing about go is that was a massive awareness that pokemon exists in a way we havent seen since the pokemania that awareness alone is a huge deal
pokemon,not_removed,i bought a and got into pokemon only because of go and i still play both versions
pokemon,not_removed,where i work several people got sun and moon after being reinvigorated by pokemon go they hadnt played pokemon since red and blue and still went out and bought a small sample size i know but if it happened to people i work with then im sure it had a pretty large impact
pokemon,not_removed,i liked the anime as a kid and played through part of emerald before but go actually got me back into pokemon enough to buy a for moon
pokemon,not_removed,i think its more that pokemon go reminded everyone of why they love pokemon and made pokemon fresh in everyones minds
pokemon,not_removed,not the same crowd willing to spend on game and console i mean you can get one with pokemon for € wich translates with the stupid convertor to somefuckinghow so yeah
pokemon,not_removed,give it a few months i bet it at least gets close to that range its still early in their life span
pokemon,not_removed,i was saying top for pokemon games rby has never had any competition for how many it sold and dppt has held on with for years of games now
pokemon,not_removed,smash lost a lot of people when they made it more casualfriendly after melee false rumor actually brawl did it better
pokemon,not_removed,brawl outsold melee a decade ago so your anedocte has nothing to do with what he was talking about the sales of an entirely different version if any smash is not higher and its not bad either just not beating pokemon iirc it already surpassed melee too because all the focus on the series went to the wiiu version while the one remaining as the one to people who didnt wanted to buy a console just for smash its not really a game you use to play in groups friends tourneys etc like console versions of smash neither
pokemon,not_removed,fyi already surpassed melee
pokemon,not_removed,bundled
pokemon,not_removed,its not even a pokemon game just a casual app for killing some time while walking
pokemon,not_removed,i hope you like it
pokemon,not_removed,how many games have you played of the series so far
pokemon,not_removed,i also got the sun pokemon go got me back into pokemon and i had skipped over sixth gen completely until now
pokemon,not_removed,would love a link or at least a clarification on spiking as well as the utmost confidence that it was go that caused these spikes and not general hype for sunmoon as built by the trailers etc
pokemon,not_removed,for sure
pokemon,not_removed,ah mb i didnt fully read your comment
pokemon,not_removed,and the fact that brawl outsold melee has no meaning unless the stat is able to be broken down into people who consider themselves casual players and people who consider themselves more hardcore players the wii and wiiu created this ocean of gimmicky content that got the casual crowd to gobble up the consoles so all arguments of this nature have to take that huge influx of people who arent typical gamers and who usually dont keep focus on one game for too long into account im not saying brawl isnt a fun game i liked it but its too busy and they removed the more technical aspects of battling while adding in unnecessary frames into most of the animations thus slowing the gameplay down it made me and all of my friends not even give smash or smash a second glance
pokemon,not_removed,ive played sun and it was amazing great fun so i decided to buy a copy of omega ruby so ive kinda played it a bit backwards but it will be two
pokemon,not_removed,here you go and here you go theres also an analysis from that famous twitter analyst dude that loves dynasty warriors but im in class and really dont want to dig through his tweet archive right now
pokemon,not_removed,heres the twitter analyst i was referring to by the way immediate data is there and more in the replies to himself
pokemon,not_removed,has no meaning unless the stat is able to be broken down into people who consider themselves casual players and people who consider themselves actually not true the other user the post he replied my post and the whole thread is talking about sales and sales dont differ or have no meaning just because you consider someone else less of a gamer their money is worthy the same even if they waste it on angry birds you considering yourself part of a subculture has zero bearing too as your information is anedoctal as you said it having any bearing here is factually wrong youre complaining about a game you never played because you disliked brawl thats a whole different game and that we proved didnt lowered the sales again what were discussing here he said hes surprised smash is not higher you implied it sold bad because hardcores never tried it i said its not true as not only it sold well but it also outsold melee so this elitist talk has zero to do with the subject the sales
pokemon,not_removed,right i forgot only sales to hardcore players count when looking at sales data of course
pokemon,not_removed,definitely consider getting one of the virtual console games theyre cheap and you can transfer your pokemon out of them
pokemon,not_removed,you can transfer your ruby team to sun if you get pokemon bank when youre finished too
pokemon,not_removed,just curious who were your starters in omega ruby and sun
pokemon,not_removed,rowlet and treecko i just havent heard of many people using sceptile and ghost type is one of my favourites
pokemon,not_removed,thats weird people arent using sceptile cause he is my favorite grass type also me and you chose the exact same starters have you beaten omega ruby yet if so what was your team
pokemon,not_removed,i have indeed beaten it and my team was gallade sceptile sandslash sharpedo charizard and manectric i received a charmander from wonder trade and it was too good a deal to pass up
pokemon,not_removed,did you have mega charizard also did you beat the battle maison yet i am doing it right now
pokemon,not_removed,oh no im still trying to finish the rayquaza stuff in the post game
pokemon,not_removed,oh the delta episode have you grabbed your johto starter yet
pokemon,not_removed,nope at the moment im just trying to get hold of a ditto
pokemon,not_removed,just go inside your house leave out and then the professor will call you telling you to choose one
pokemon,not_removed,there were no remakes in gen and we got sequels to blackwhite instead of a third version so the pattern of two was broken right there xy had many hints for sunmoon including an npc who told us he was from a far away region that wasnt any of the ones we currently knew about said that wed see it for ourselves soon and even gave us an item from there that directly referenced hawaii so its pretty clear that this was the intention all along there was never going to be a z version and any hanging plot threads can easily be continued in the new games
pokemon,not_removed,as far as we know it was never in development so you cant say to bring it back and also masuda even said that they most likely would not do a z and i can see why zygardes story probably wasnt very different from xerneas and yveltals
pokemon,not_removed,no we havent had a third version in almost ten years we dont need them not every legendary pokemon needs a game
pokemon,not_removed,patterns are perceived not correct if you look back theyve never done the same thing twice gen paired release redgreen release blue special release pikachu gen paired release goldsilver release crystal gen paired release rubysapphire remakes fireredleafgreen release emerald gen paired release diamondpearl release platinum remakes hgss gen paired release blackwhite paired release gen paired release xy remakes oras gen paired release sunmoon
pokemon,not_removed,first off emerald wasnt the first of its kind japan got the original red and green then came blue which used better sprites a redesigned cerulean cave and bug fixes then came gold and silver followed by crystal which added suicune to the plot and threw in a wireless connectivity service via cell phones japan only as for z it aint happening masuda himself said that theyre doing away with third versions mostly to keep fans guessing
pokemon,not_removed,i think weve seen from gen that theres going to be no more grey or z versions coming out anymore masuda has said in the past that he doesnt want pokemon to fall into a predictable format where everybody knows each release before it is even announced also if you look at the sales of crystal emerald and platinum theyre really not as good as gs rs or dp neither were frlg hgss or oras for that matter when compared to the main games in their generations it might be because people are expecting those kinds of releases and thats exactly what game freak doesnt want for the series it could also be because the revenue for those games just isnt worth it to go in and pretty much retune the overworld and add in even more stuff to it
pokemon,not_removed,what is with pokemon fans and patterns anyway
pokemon,not_removed,im honestly all for switch ups rather than third versions zygarde might get ha redemption in sm watch the post game be us collecting the zygarde cores if not watch the anime and get your zygarde fillhisory there it seems like the zygarde story is unfolding in the anime thats part of the world of multimedia franchises
pokemon,not_removed,it certainly would have made the final confrontation a lot more exciting in my opinion if done correctly though
pokemon,not_removed,well more like
pokemon,not_removed,he literally said they were stopping that because it became too predictable at this point
pokemon,not_removed,autism
pokemon,not_removed,lets be real we have no idea why they really decided not to do z beyond the canned pr response i would honestly bet that the reason is closer to the fact that to do xyorasz for gen vi and then have sm as gen vii would mean theres been a new game per year since around
pokemon,not_removed,we actually do know why theyre not doing z masuda said he doesnt want to make something people expect and predict not only that but the sales for the third wheel versions have not only been lower than all of the other games but theyve been consistently dropping
pokemon,not_removed,except that doesnt account for the fact that the game simply does not exist it does not exist as a sequel like a prequel or any flavor of gaiden let alone a third game the itd be predictable answer would fit if we did get z mind you im using z to refer to any zygardecentric game because it would explain why z appeared as a sequel or prequel or a nonthird version game however z does not exist sales cant necessarily be a primary factor although they may be a contributing factor given that despite not being bona fide third game still sold less for a few reasons game freak is a private company its not dependent on pleasing its shareholders with sales figures they still make lots of money copies at usd and not factoring in any costs generates like in revenue and likely at a higher profit margin since they build off of something already there and declining sales is irrelevant because those sales are dependent on handheld sales which have also been declining and thus so must pokemon game sales but also because pokemon game sales on the whole have been declining again we really have no nonpr reason why z again as a generic third zygardefocused kalos game was never released
pokemon,not_removed,hidden power ice is more useful because its super effective against grass dragon and ground all types jolteon would otherwise be unable to do substancial damage not to mention there are a lot of common pokemon who are good switches against jolteon who have abilities that negate water moves like gastrodon
pokemon,not_removed,jolteon is not very bulky so wish is fairly useless on him substitute is best used for baton passing or setting up stats give him baton pass and agilitywork up if you want to use substitute even then jolteon would be better just sweeping hp ice is simply better than hp water it covers grass ground and dragon which electric is weak or immune to hp water only covers ground vswitch and tbolt are both good although if you have to get rid of one id keep vswitch in terms of an item choice specs works nicely on jolteon assuming youre only running attacking moves otherwise a statboosting berry could work for a baton pass set and life orb could work if you keep your support moves
pokemon,not_removed,ground isnt the only type jolteon needs to worry about grass and dragon both resist electric and hp water is resisted by both of those types as well ice has great offensive synergy with electric as it has neutral coverage on almost every type combination try a choice specs moveset with thunderbolt volt switch hp ice and signal beam it will do a ton of damage and volt switch helps jolteon avoid hits as you move into flying types or levitate pokemon while expecting a ground type move
pokemon,not_removed,rstunfisk might be able to help you a little more though youre getting pretty good responses in this thread good luck with your jolteon hes my fave eeveelution
pokemon,not_removed,yes
pokemon,not_removed,theyll struggle once any pokemon runs out of pp they struggle
pokemon,not_removed,this is my set up for smeargles and dittos smeargle recycle na na na persian switcharoo any any any holding leppa berry sneasel brick break false swipe snatch na for smeargle you start with smeargle and use recycle it will then get sketched then you will switch to persian and use switcharoo giving the leppa to the enemy smeargle then switch to sneasel and false swipe then brick break the called smeargle what will happen is the smeargle will start to use recycle till it runs out the leppa will kick in and he will get to recycle again this also works with dittos he will transform into the smeargle just remember to get rid of sketch from your smeargle i got this idea from
pokemon,not_removed,couldnt you give a pokemon a pp adding berry and have the mon use the move that switches items
pokemon,not_removed,thought so cheers
pokemon,not_removed,thats a nice build will definitely save that for after ive finished getting this one thanks
pokemon,not_removed,yes check the thread i just created lol rip dont make the same mistake
pokemon,not_removed,i kept losing track of its pp was getting me a bit panicky especially as i dont want my owl guy to run out of false swipe pp too early on do you know how many you chained to encounter the shiny smeargle in the end at now
pokemon,not_removed,should probably keep track but i really havent im doing it while watching streams on twitch and such super distracted if i had to guess id say it was around but in like different chains lol and thats with the shiny charm need to find a counter or something i can just tap maybe two even one for turns and one for the chain
pokemon,not_removed,the setup im using atm is s smeargle with hold backsporesoaklick i hold back the first smeargle he sketches hold back i switch to greninja use an adrenaline orb he calls for help i just kill the help with water shuriken when he either doesnt call for help or help doesnt come i skip a turn using another adrenaline orb and or using a leppa berry which i farmed of in poke pelago depending on the pp status of water shuriken then a few turns later when he once again doesnt call for help or help doesnt come i switch to my smeargle and hold back on the new one then kill the original one to keep the chain going with pps on the new smeargle its pretty easy once you get the hang of it just dont be distracted like i am i think ill just start killing the older one sooner id rather waste time than waste the chain
pokemon,not_removed,ye thats a nice set up getting a bit worried as i have like pp items i saw a nice build using a false swipe smeargle holding a leppa berry with refresh or whatever the move is so it has unlimited pp essentially thats why im trying to chain a nice little smeargle
pokemon,not_removed,also nice job on getting the shiny charm already im not even in post yet
pokemon,not_removed,at about i got the shiny encounter false swiped it switched to gengar to sleep it cursed body disabled the shinys move i slept it hoping i could switch and kill the other in time it woke up after one move and it died
pokemon,not_removed,sos are more likely to appear if you use a super effective attack btw
pokemon,not_removed,just farm leppa berries in poke pelago its exponential lick is just because i plan to maybe sos chain for a mimikyu or sandygast
pokemon,not_removed,woot i love sos chaining
pokemon,not_removed,i figured i have such crap luck with stuff like that usually it was just better for me to get the shiny charm before hunting for any
pokemon,not_removed,ahh first i hear thanks thats good info i might switch to my machamp to farm those then
pokemon,not_removed,nice
pokemon,not_removed,looks amazing what kind of paint do you use
pokemon,not_removed,this is so cool this reminds me of when nintendo announced the new wouldnt be coming to america and i was sad that we wouldnt be getting the cover plates since they were
pokemon,not_removed,godammit thats beautiful
pokemon,not_removed,pretty shit make me one
pokemon,not_removed,this question could use some clarity but ill answer what i can see with the exp share on all pokemon in the party should get evs from the defeated pokemon that includes sos battles using false swipe to drop the pokemon in the slot to hp will cause the pokemon to call in an ally to the slot defeating the pokemon in the slot should yield evs to the entire team
pokemon,not_removed,mine works perfectly fine you sure the exp share is on
pokemon,not_removed,im sorry if i wasnt clear im stressed and sleepy my question is should absol or primarina be holding the power bracer and if the exp share trick works
pokemon,not_removed,it wouldnt make sense unless i played with exp share off all my play through which i doubt ill double check i guess
pokemon,not_removed,its not a trick its designed to do that the pokemon that you want to affect should hold the power item lets give you and example i have a geodude that needs max evs in attack i start by giving the geodude a power bracer modifies evs to attack i make sure my exp share is on i then start battling drowzee and use my marowak in the party lead spot because it has false swipe then i use an adrenaline orb in the fight and start attackingdefeating the called drowzee each giving the team experience and evs each drowzee gives evs and the power item modifies the evs gained by the geodude if you still have questions just ask
pokemon,not_removed,wait are you training your primarina if you want primarina to gain evs let it hold the power item
pokemon,not_removed,oh ok so not all my pokemon are gonna have the modification of the power item i get it now i thought that if my false swipe user had the power item it would share the ev it gained with the whole team if only lol thanks a lot
pokemon,not_removed,yeah so primarina should be the on holding the power item not absol so exp share only gives for sos pokemon evs per pokemon even if the leader has the power item
pokemon,not_removed,no problem
pokemon,not_removed,exp only gets partial distribution iirc but evs should be transferred fully let primarin hold the power item
pokemon,not_removed,yeah thanks i get it now thanks 😊
pokemon,not_removed,apparently people dont know that you can use gen evolutions in heartgold soulsilver so a team of gen evolutions
pokemon,not_removed,xy no starter heliolisk crawdaunt toxicroak golurk pansear trevenant
pokemon,not_removed,oras cradily da best whiscash torkoal grumpig swalot hariyama pretty challenging group to play through with but should be fun if you want to sub in a pelipper for a flying type that could work too i just think whiscash is very underrated for a water type
pokemon,not_removed,you mean the ones that are available in the game like togekiss tangrowth yanmega
pokemon,not_removed,no starter is my favorite way to play through older games shove that mudkip in the box to be transferred to diamond tailow is now your starter lol
pokemon,not_removed,yep
pokemon,not_removed,not a bad idea
pokemon,not_removed,its ya boi bowser
pokemon,not_removed,these sound great together nice job
pokemon,not_removed,the hated koopa that steals your princess and never backs down
pokemon,not_removed,those donuts lol
pokemon,not_removed,is gardevoir your favorite
pokemon,not_removed,credit to for their work on this piece
pokemon,not_removed,i love the addition of the pokeballs that they came in which lucky mon got the luxury ball
pokemon,not_removed,on my tiny phone screen those rice balls in snorlaxs mouth looked like eyes i had to count the rest of your pokémon just to make sure the sixth wasnt hiding in the big guys mouth
pokemon,not_removed,that trainers buffer than his pokémon dang gains
pokemon,not_removed,these jelly doughnuts taste great
pokemon,not_removed,the cat or the actor
pokemon,not_removed,why yes it is i caught mine in and have her still today
pokemon,not_removed,my shiny poke aya the gardevoir
pokemon,not_removed,eyes huh i never thought onigris could be mistaken for anything besides donuts p far as it goes the water types are cuddling the fighting types are fighting and the waifu types are stealing glasses
pokemon,not_removed,nothing beats a jelly filled donut
pokemon,not_removed,awesome gardevoir is my favorite
pokemon,not_removed,good taste i havent had mine for quite as long but shes still really special to me she ohkod a mega rayquaza once and shes not even modest
pokemon,not_removed,definitely a special mon
pokemon,not_removed,if you want to play a game with somebody just connect to the internet on your or check out pokémon showdown or even better make real life friends who play pokémon
pokemon,not_removed,didnt you post this an hour ago
pokemon,not_removed,check out his overview hes just asking everywhere to have somebody play with him
pokemon,not_removed,yes i posted it because i want to play with someone none of my friend are interested in pokemon so i tought it will be a good idea to search online
pokemon,not_removed,repetitive posting wont do much good
pokemon,not_removed,i just want to play with someone not battle them
pokemon,not_removed,that isnt what they said at all stop spamming reddit
pokemon,not_removed,hate to break it to you but pokemon is primarily single player if you dont actively battle
pokemon,not_removed,diantha was personally called to the gym by olympia so she can be informed of the kalos crisis its probably because she is the champion diantha learns zygarde and ash and co are involved ash is actually following through with his promise to raise his stamina from xyz so he can handle the strain from the transformation ash falls to the ground while trying to navigate from tree to tree he just doesnt have enough skill to do this despite his failure to keep up with greninja ash still feels that their bond is getting stronger diantha appears before the main characters to inform them of her findings related to the crisis when diantha tells the main characters about zygarde and asks the main characters of any strange incidents they have experienced nobody brings up team flare and squishy i guess villainous organizations attempting to capture pokemon for themselves doesnt qualify as strange to the main protagonists jessie is once again deluded that she is the best actress there is a recurring gag from and she believes diantha a seasoned and renowned actress is nothing compared to her the battle plays out just like last time and ash is getting frustrated that despite getting stronger he still cant land an attack on gardevoir ash finally taps into his instincts to maneuver gardevoir into a position where greninja can attack it oh i forgot this is the first time team rocket has actually seen ashgreninja gardevoir why do you keep spamming shadow ball and reflect its a bit frustrating that gardevoir has access to another move that would have done more damage to greninja ashgreninja almost pushes mega gardevoir into a corner but it appeared that diantha held back so she can give ash and greninja time to use that forme diantha only had mega gardevoir use its full power to break free from one of team rockets traps ash seems to care more about greninjas wellbeing than his own when he regains consciousness typical ash diantha is still not sure that ashgreninja is related to the crisis but she thinks this power may be used to resolve that crisis diantha leaves so she can investigate this more diantha will apparently be present at the kalos league much like cynthia was a guest at the sinnoh league team flare is apparently starting the last stage of their zygarde plan and we still dont know what they are after the episode ends with ashs promises to win his eighth badge and master the transformation nothing new there
pokemon,not_removed,can i find somewhere all discussions about all the episodes
pokemon,not_removed,exactly what transformation did ash go through
pokemon,not_removed,exciting episode got two sweet screenshots out of it too httpimgurcomaarwdp
pokemon,not_removed,rtitlegore
pokemon,not_removed,thank you this summary was so helpful
pokemon,not_removed,this is a pastebin for the ones that i have been able to do
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,wut
pokemon,not_removed,rtitlegore httpsnpredditcomrcanthearyoubot
pokemon,not_removed,users who have completed their poni island challenge can post their screenshot on this comment note that commenting will be seen as agreement to override any existing ball flair please note after this sticky is removed you will have to post them on the weekly hype thread
pokemon,not_removed,some good advice if you dont have a good team for the battle tree just borrow one pokemon company themselves provide two battle tree teams and you can find other rental teams although i cant find more battle tree teams specifically edit more direct links to the pokémon company provided battle tree teams are and
pokemon,not_removed,i had an amazing run tonight in which i made it through a streak in super singles for the first time ever the battle tree lookup doc linked in the op was invaluable on this run its pretty much a necessity past battle having it will put you one step ahead of the competition and allow you to adapt your strategy much more effectively i know i never would have made it even close to without it some notes on how to use the team i always led with minior and went for shell smash on turn use the lookup table to check if your opponent has any priority moves or a quick claw if not you can usually continue to set up shell smashes until you take a hit otherwise one shell smash then start attacking miniors focus sash may even trigger on that first hit activating shields down and doubling acrobatics power if the opponent happens to have sturdy or a focus sash that can also be problematic but you can still bring in mimikyu to finish them with shadow sneak if need be also worth noting is that minior is immune to status conditions except confusion while at hp which the tree ai doesnt seem to understand you can sometimes set up shell smashes while they spam toxic or yawn to no avail while minior can sweep a lot of the time mimikyu is great for picking up the slack when it cant swords dance until you take a hit then go to town beware of play roughs small chance to miss but dont be afraid to use it if you need the extra power over shadow claw or its a better type matchup fun fact shadow sneak will always oneshot any gardevoir or gallade in the tree i am convinced that toxapex hide is the strongest substance in the pokemon world this thing is nigh indestructible dont get too cocky though death by a thousand cuts is still entirely possible if you neglect to use recover and baneful bunker to keep him healthy he is also the undisputed king of stall battle in my run lasted around turns with me just pp stalling a lapras that i couldnt damage because toxapexs only damaging move is scald and it had water absorb use toxapex when you need to tank its also great to bring in after minior if the type matchup is good baneful bunker can poison pesky physical attackers and scald can leave a burn good luck i hope these three serve you well
pokemon,not_removed,i think this global mission will be achieveable many people use it
pokemon,not_removed,those looking to build a team can use this httppokemonforevercomteambuilderphp to help figure out any holes in your team nothing sucks more than getting to round only to get walled by that one typing hole you have in your team
pokemon,not_removed,man this is so much more fun then spam trading can actually play the game this time
pokemon,not_removed,seriously its not unheard of for a single person to get several thousand bp in a day this is a really low bar especially considering the gts trade goal was million if you have supers unlocked racking up bp is way easier than racking up gts trades even taking magnemite coils into account
pokemon,not_removed,wow it hasnt been hours yet and weve reached yeah we definitely got this
pokemon,not_removed,another tip if you think you kinda suck at battle tree battling you can get in battles in the regular singles be careful for battle lefend red though hes worth
pokemon,not_removed,well that was pretty fast now lets all go towards the pootis heavy ball
pokemon,not_removed,just a few hours and were already a tenth of the way there sweet i wonder if theyll have another apricorn ball for bp
pokemon,not_removed,suck at battle and have a heavy type bias not really for me tried regardless rekt by red naturally then stopped at round at least i did something
pokemon,not_removed,ill try but im so useless at competitive battling
pokemon,not_removed,hey everyone i just finished a win streak lost to a rain team i used tapu koko kangaskhan garchomp and celesteela heres my qr team and my proof httpiimgurcomgytsspnjpg feel free to ama e forgot to mention this was super doubles
pokemon,not_removed,well we hit the stretch goal that was rather fast
pokemon,not_removed,i think the mods should add a weekly rotation sticky in which players can share their teams that they use for the battle tree would certainly be useful
pokemon,not_removed,quite easy im just in super single to farm bp items are so expensive
pokemon,not_removed,quick question i really hate breeding i really hate battling too i actually havent touched the battle tree since i got the game at launch but i really want the heavy ball so i can use the qr code teams right because if i have to use my own pokémon theres no possibility of me completing this haha
pokemon,not_removed,its been out for a few hours and we almost completed the goal
pokemon,not_removed,just did my first win streak but im just as proud as i am salty the rng made me think i was going to lose several times i played in super singles with garchomp mega charizard y and azumarill very good switchin potential thanks to type immunities i contributed bp and as of this post the gm appears in my game at bp i think were going to kill it in the first day
pokemon,not_removed,color me impressed in the morning before work i saw the news on serebii planned to register after work in the evening now i come back here and its already done
pokemon,not_removed,i wonder how hard this would be for people like me who couldnt give less of a shit about ivs and evs i shall see
pokemon,not_removed,i have a question is it time to unlink the teams from the last competition or do we have to receive the prizes first
pokemon,not_removed,im doing the global mission im using amarowak pheromosa and mega alakazam
pokemon,not_removed,im looking forward to joining in on this once i get home im currently on a steak of my team is as follows mgyarados garchomp and aegislash previously with this team i got to
pokemon,not_removed,just contributed points by using a qr team to beat singles they really set the goal too low
pokemon,not_removed,aww man i like my golden pokémon bank flair but this one is cool too decisions decisions
pokemon,not_removed,is it still possible to get the mission rewards for the third global mission or do they expire
pokemon,not_removed,i was unaware of these challenges if we completed last months are we still eligible for the special flair now
pokemon,not_removed,we won according to serebii edit as of writing over has been earned so entry guarantees all rewards if you earn
pokemon,not_removed,im trying to login to the pokemon global link i tried for the entirety of the last challenge and failed and am failing right now i didnt really care that much about missing the friend ball but if i miss a heavy ball because of this issue or a love ball in a future challenge ill be extremely pissed
pokemon,not_removed,can i still participate in this and get the rewards even though its completed
pokemon,not_removed,can someone explain how fc are awarded depending on how many bps you got how many you need to rack up for maximum payout
pokemon,not_removed,can you guys wait a day or two before completely demolishing the global mission goal next time i want to feel like i actually contribute
pokemon,not_removed,turns out was far to easy oh gamefreak why did you think bp would be hard to achieve
pokemon,not_removed,dragonite megametagross and mimikyu swept through the singles like its nothing over bp so far and counting hopefully they add more prizes for bp
pokemon,not_removed,this global mission reminded me i should probably go to the battle tree last time i went there i got murdered by red or blue no clue who i fought
pokemon,not_removed,yeah im just going to mention to the people i know who play sm that that theres some global challenge thing on
pokemon,not_removed,by the end of the first day of the mission wed gotten more than three times the goal xd
pokemon,not_removed,how do we claim the heavy ball reward for the global mission
pokemon,not_removed,bootstrapping yourself into a reasonable battle towermaisonwhatever team used to be so obnoxious trying to grind points for items while using a suboptimal team qr rentals make the whole thing so much nicer
pokemon,not_removed,wait you need battles in a row for the global mission i thought it was just earn bp edit serebii is saying its just bp you need i coincidentally won battles last night so i guess im good
pokemon,not_removed,nah the battle tree does cheat
pokemon,not_removed,httpimgurcomaqxrjz
pokemon,not_removed,can i have one because i
pokemon,not_removed,httpimgurcomatotir is my battle tree streak
pokemon,not_removed,is this good enough
pokemon,not_removed,heya i have a win streak in super doubles heres my proof httpiimgurcomgytsspnjpg gimmie that flair
pokemon,not_removed,httpiimgurcompbcbljtjpg i lost to an mega audino
pokemon,not_removed,here is my win streak
pokemon,not_removed,apologies for potato quality but httpiimgurcomyxnsbgdjpg
pokemon,not_removed,i lost at
pokemon,not_removed,httpimgurcomhmjvbkf lost to flinch hax and swift swim beartic tt
pokemon,not_removed,heres my streak
pokemon,not_removed,not sure if this is the best place to ask but are these special flair badges available in rpokemon temporarily or will they always be here
pokemon,not_removed,so are we only able to have one of these island challenge ones active at a time or can we have multiple since i got the ulaula one im not sure if i want to try for this one if ill have to give up the ulaula flair
pokemon,not_removed,doing this really gave me an appreciation for huge power azumarill
pokemon,not_removed,heres mine
pokemon,not_removed,is mine
pokemon,not_removed,httpimgurcomcxdhlkq is my streak thank you
pokemon,not_removed,got my httpimgurcomtdimeig done
pokemon,not_removed,httpimgurcomhsacmyc was too lazy to write a new sheet of paper so i used the same for rshinypokemon if its okay
pokemon,not_removed,httpimgurcomavmepq sorry for the ultrashitty premium quality
pokemon,not_removed,i just realized i could have posted here first p oh well if there will be a special flair or reward for getting all of the challenge flairs then challenge accepted d
pokemon,not_removed,got my streak in super singles httpprntscrcomegwkyv posted about it on the new hype thread already but posting here as well just in case
pokemon,not_removed,i took a better picture this time with better lighting i have achieved the battle streak edit i have my flair now d yay
pokemon,not_removed,httpsimgurcomacszcm thanks in advance
pokemon,not_removed,also going to remind people that rbattlefactory is another good spot to borrow teams from
pokemon,not_removed,interesting mimikyu build from pokemon companys doubles team at least haxorus can deal with that mimikyu build
pokemon,not_removed,i hear you with toxapex whenever ferrothorn shows up it adds turns to the battle while toxapex just pp stalls it to death because itd ruin my other pokemon my god i hate running into that thing
pokemon,not_removed,thanks for this i will give it a try considering i have no trained teams of my own to participate in this yet
pokemon,not_removed,just got into a turn battle between your toxapex and an aromatisse she ran out of pp which is what finally allowed me to burn her felt good thanks again
pokemon,not_removed,this is an awesome team ive downloaded it just to check the full build and make my own what i particularly like here is that its a team exclusively composed of new pokemon i like good teams for the battle tree but i want to win with pokemon i like and if possible with new pokemon i like your team is perfect in that regard with both mimikyu and minior having interesting gimmicks and and the stalling ability of toxapex feels awesome im liking the poison type more and more this gen and theyre all gen vii i havent played it yet as im using the slow ev training method and theres still hours left but when its ready tomorrow ill go for a test run i dont know if ill make it but i know it will be fun thanks o
pokemon,not_removed,how do we access the code itself every time i find a team i like it says i have to log in on here and i cant find the teams here normally on the website
pokemon,not_removed,slightly over hours in and weve already got like points weve got this
pokemon,not_removed,only problem i see is that you dont only have to play through the game but also through the post game
pokemon,not_removed,its already been done
pokemon,not_removed,cannot reccomend this team builder it has gaping holes i spotted after tossing one of my team builds into it a doesnt think cloyster can learn ice shard b doesnt think tyranitar can learn dragon dance c doesnt think togekiss can learn nasty plot and thats just trying it out real quick if its missing movelists what else is incorrect
pokemon,not_removed,til three ghosts on my team is not the best idea at least lycanrocmidnight choice scarf can sweep with stone edge im trying that out
pokemon,not_removed,it was about hours ago thats just not right at all i just cant see that happening naturally especially considering the missions cap at and you cant get more than bp per battle normally however i do know back in gen it was possible to activate a code to give yourself however many bp you wanted over and over not directly the game would act as if one of the npcs at the frontier were giving it to you i would bet thats whats happened here
pokemon,not_removed,i heard theyd throw in the rare sandvitch healing item too if we got high enough
pokemon,not_removed,its already done lol
pokemon,not_removed,serebii says the prize is a heavy ball
pokemon,not_removed,well as long as your signed up and are linked to the pgl you should still get the heavy ball and the free fc
pokemon,not_removed,im trash too but i got bp today so ive participated enough for the rewards
pokemon,not_removed,just try your hardest i tried with my ingame team which isnt ev or iv trained and doesnt have good natures and so far i got to a streak of guess im getting pretty lucky p
pokemon,not_removed,quick question how do u use the team i am having a hard time in double battle edit here is the details kokokangchompcelesteela ignore the other lead with kang and koko then fake out and thunderbolt no tricks just git gud
pokemon,not_removed,just figured id thank you again for sharing your team the first time i got to before making mistakes the second time i got to before making mistakes just now i hit and beat blue there some tense moments but for the most part lucky was on my side didnt face a single legendary team going to take a break and see how far i can take it later my main goal was getting the stamp and i thank you for your excellent team
pokemon,not_removed,what would you do against httpwwwserebiinetsunmoonbattletreepriyashtml just got took to the cleaners how would you have approached the battle would you have switched garchomp in immediately for who this is how i did obviously the following is filled with mistake upon mistake she started with zapdos and raikou i started tapu koko and kangaskhan thunderbolt did a good first hit against zapdos but survived my fake out on raikou didnt work because it had inner focus i should have realized this when i didnt see pressure but didnt realize inner focus affected fake out this was mistake zapdos used ancient power and got the boost to all stats this is my luck raikous charge beam got the boost in spa i tried taking out zapdos with another thunderbolt but apparently the increase in spd meant he survived mistake zapdos and raikou proceed to take out tapu koko with another ap and cb instead of having kangaskhan finish off zapdos i attacked raikou which meant both zapdos survived mistake she brings in suicine i bring in garchomp not realizing zapdos has roost i use sucker punch on him hes faster so either way he gets roost off but now i do no damage suicine survives z ground move from garchomp and ohkos him with ice beam now i bring in celesteela i tried setting up leech seed and substitute but was essentially left with just celesteela against to lighting users in azelf used zmove and zapdos again i wasted hrs in battle tree she was i believe i really hate the time wasting that battle tree is
pokemon,not_removed,yes rental teams are fine for the battle tree
pokemon,not_removed,make sure you account is linked and that you at least get bp for that heavy ball last time a lot of people were tokd lies that you didnt need your account to be linked and didnt get that friend ball
pokemon,not_removed,if you hate breeding and battling what do you do in the game
pokemon,not_removed,weve already killed it goals are dead and gone
pokemon,not_removed,your team can be unlinked as soon as the competition ends it doesnt have any effect on rewards the rewards arent even given out for a while anyways so the game making you wait would be a pretty terrible design
pokemon,not_removed,if you previously got to youve already won check with the lady to the right of the entrance and shell say your highest streak take a picture of that post in this thread and youre golden
pokemon,not_removed,i think the code you receive on the pgl website expires at the end of march you got time to redeem it
pokemon,not_removed,yeah for sure
pokemon,not_removed,yes as long as you get at least bp for the rare candy
pokemon,not_removed,if the mission fails you get the lower amount if the mission succeeds you get the higher amount if its linked to i want to say global link its doubled thats all it is
pokemon,not_removed,iirc you can still participate just sign up at the festival plaza it doesnt end until
pokemon,not_removed,wait for the mission to finish
pokemon,not_removed,if you mean in the sense that they use brightpowder and other accuracy modifiers sure but the rng doesnt favor the cpu or anything
pokemon,not_removed,hey there what team did you use to get that with im still looking for a doubles team that can get me to for the stamp and possibly trying for this streak for this challenge edit i see now that you posted it further down in the thread
pokemon,not_removed,hey there you are going to need to subscribe to the subreddit for your ballflair to appear just a heads up
pokemon,not_removed,you will need to subscribe to the subreddit for your flair to activate
pokemon,not_removed,dont worry you still have plenty of time
pokemon,not_removed,users will maintain them as long as we can provide them if we dramatically change the css and can no longer support them then obviously they will be done away with however there are no plans to do that the kahuna challenges will be open for at least the duration of the year
pokemon,not_removed,you can only have the most recent one youve received we may have an award for completing all however
pokemon,not_removed,yeah it is interesting im using it right now and im impressed how effective it is but i think itd be more effective with a level mimikyu wonder why they decided to use a level one
pokemon,not_removed,try logging into the pgl and then clicking the link there should be a button below the team that says display qr code
pokemon,not_removed,we just reached the heavy ball goal on day
pokemon,not_removed,um now we have
pokemon,not_removed,you can get bp at the battle royale its bp per loss so very doable
pokemon,not_removed,not really just beat the elite four right
pokemon,not_removed,yup it isnt perfect but if you can find one that is id like to know
pokemon,not_removed,im using a lycanroc midday and i had to get rid of stone edge cause the accuracy kept fucking me over by having every single freaking pokemon avoid it idk how if you have same problems with the move
pokemon,not_removed,i dunno it is pretty easy to get bp i got about today its definitely more fun than trading magnemite on gts
pokemon,not_removed,being honest here we kinda curbstomped this global mission im already preparing for the next competition
pokemon,not_removed,as does the pgl page
pokemon,not_removed,last time that was only added because we crushed it so hard though maybe we will get another surprise
pokemon,not_removed,theres no ai abuse or anything just play to the best of your ability fake out is an amazing tool so use it to protect koko dont be afraid to waste your z move conserve your pkm if you can but tapu koko prefers to switch in after a ko celesteela is there for assurance you wont lose to double team cresselia and stuff
pokemon,not_removed,i wouldve just switched kangaskhan into garchomp immediately unless it had air balloon tec rage ohko raikou ko zapdos with another tbolt main fear is the set with gigavolt havoc you can also switch tapu koko out into kangaskhan turn so you have fo to stop the next pokemon while chomper can outspeedko a weakened zapdos quick tip just turn off battle animations your runs will go a lot faster also koko and kangaskhan ohko azelf i dont think ive ever seen an azelf set because i ko it so quickly haha
pokemon,not_removed,perfect thanks so much
pokemon,not_removed,wait required its not like i need the heavy ball but is this requirement hidden somewhere
pokemon,not_removed,thanks for the info i linked my account a while back so i just need to do a couple few battles and ill be all set
pokemon,not_removed,shiny hunting its more competitive breeding that gets to be too much for me but i love shiny hunting have just under shinies and counting
pokemon,not_removed,oh is that how you get the pokeballs and stuff in addition to the fc
pokemon,not_removed,i know i did i just dont feel like ive earned anything
pokemon,not_removed,im asking for when the mission is finished
pokemon,not_removed,the rng doesnt favor the cpu or anything except it does in terms of them specifically choosing things youre weak to they get to see exactly what youre bringing which is cheating when you compare it to pvp it doesnt make it hard like they probably believe it does it just makes it cheap their teams should either be completely randomized or they should be done like pvp battles in that you get to select your pokémon after seeing what they might have from six possible pokémon each battle not each session with of course their choices being based on what you might have as seeing what youve definitely brought is nonsense unless youve only brought the required number a little more difficult an ai to program im sure but much fairer while still maintaining a difficulty if theyre properly trained etc
pokemon,not_removed,not the op of the above comment but im currently on a win streak with the following orangurulurantisporygon most of the time you start by protecting lurantis and have oranguru set up tr then you just spam leaf storm and instruct and its pretty tunnel vision afterwards because after contrary boost even not very effective leaf storms will ko almost anything if for some reasons things go bad you have the unkillable porygon araquanid combo coming from behind to save the day its pretty easy to farm bp this way i can share the qr code if you wanna try it yourself
pokemon,not_removed,which subreddit do i need to sub to im subscribed to rpokémon
pokemon,not_removed,whew if there are enough global missions ill definitely get the festival plaza one cant wait to see what the other two are
pokemon,not_removed,hm thats a little disappointing well ill probably fail to get to a streak anyways so i guess its not that big of a deal only just hit last night well maybe ill be able to pull off all i hope you do decide to do an island champion flair i think thatd be a great incentive
pokemon,not_removed,likely to make the ai target mimikyu over her partner so her partner can set up under that set though and considering the ai i would just use trick room rather than destiny bond
pokemon,not_removed,ok thanks
pokemon,not_removed,speaking of the ball goal where do you get the friend ball from the last mission i only got the fc
pokemon,not_removed,you can o thanks for telling me
pokemon,not_removed,no you have to get to the battle tree wich requires to navigate there and beat up some post game trainers
pokemon,not_removed,this one does not show resistances but does give good randomised teams with options to weight the distribution with varying regard to current meta and has no errors on movelistsabilityitems etc httpshonkogithubiopokemonteamgenerator these two in combination give your type resistancecoverages httpwwwpsypokescomdextypeanalysisphp httpspokemondbnettoolstypecoverage the beauty of these tools in combination over having a tidy allinone that takes much more work to maintain for new games is that as the typing ones do not go by specific pokemon species or moves but rather just the types they do not need updating
pokemon,not_removed,idk how if you have same problems with the move midnight has no guard as the hidden ability which causes all moves to always hit so id assume thats what theyre using
pokemon,not_removed,yes easy but still tedious due to how cheap it can be and much more easily cheated than all of the others were precisely because they required a specific activity that you couldnt possibly cheat the number on you could give yourself all the pokémon to trade or master balls to capture pokémon or set your game time ahead all you wanted to reset the qr scanner in the world but you were still taking the time to deal with them that couldnt be skipped assuming the games still operate on similar functionality to give you bp this can be
pokemon,not_removed,im not sure how to use the celesteela on your team should i be trying to set up with it using leech seedsubstitute or am i just supposed to go straight for heavy slam i feel like setting up in the battle tree too much will lead to losing heavily
pokemon,not_removed,thanks for the tips didnt realize you could turn that off just hit after hours turned it off just now so that should help especially with the zmove ill keep your trips in mind next time i see her just another follow up if her zapdos gets an ancient power boost again would you recommend going with protect while garchomp ohkos raikou if zapdos gets boosted it would take hits to kill it with thunderbolt provided i dont get a critical im thinking at the very least tapu koko will survive the turn and see what pokemon turns up to decide further
pokemon,not_removed,nah you only need to join the mission for the ball but if you get you get rare candies though
pokemon,not_removed,even though the site only said it about the bp is just for the rare candy it probably also for the ball seeing how last mission people join but didnt do trades and didnt get the ball
pokemon,not_removed,yeah you had to have registered your game on the pgl site if you havent done it before i dont think you can get the previous global mission additional prizes but its not too late for the current global mission
pokemon,not_removed,ah usually theyll release code you put in for the items
pokemon,not_removed,do you have evidence of this other then anecdotal
pokemon,not_removed,that sounds pretty cool id like to try it if you wouldnt mind
pokemon,not_removed,on the sidebar above your username set your flair pokemon do you have the the box checked that says show my flair on this subreddit it looks like
pokemon,not_removed,if we do it will likely require users to posts all four screenshots at once for verification anyways either way good luck on the future challenges
pokemon,not_removed,yep thats what ive been doing trick room belly drum and when mimikyu finally uses both its disguise and focus sash i destiny bond edit i just lost due to mimikyu being taunted so watch out for that
pokemon,not_removed,you get the code through the pgl
pokemon,not_removed,just a note bp from the battle royale doesnt count the mission is specifically for bp from the battle tree
pokemon,not_removed,repelsbring your full team should be enough not really postgame
pokemon,not_removed,son of a bitch now it makes sense
pokemon,not_removed,actually in gen as well as in gen you gain bp after each battle as opposed to after a set of seven battles for the few people serious about racking up huge streaks it is relatively easy to get bp its bp per victory after the battle legend in the super battles not to mention you have bp earned from getting there if you started your streak from scratch
pokemon,not_removed,just go for heavy slam most of the time steela doesnt really need coverage moves outside of vgc since you basically have a nodrawback stab move at all times its also a great switchin for eqs and such so i mainly use it for pivoting in to a better position
pokemon,not_removed,you actually need the bp for the ball because last mission you needed the trades for the friend ball
pokemon,not_removed,thats a lot not tempted personally but if this is made clearer it couldve lured much more people in and we couldve finished it in hours p
pokemon,not_removed,yeah im registered on the pgl i just didnt realize there were codes for the pokeballs there thanks
pokemon,not_removed,thanks
pokemon,not_removed,here you are
pokemon,not_removed,omg i found it thanks i turned it on now
pokemon,not_removed,just a suggestion why not let us choose between our badges flairs like if we have both the bulu and fini badges maybe i want to equip the fini this month and bulu next month just let us pickcustomize alongside with the set flair text option would be great the flairs would still need to be initially unlocked via providing proofs of meeting the island kahuna challenge goals set by this sub
pokemon,not_removed,ah right i forgot pokemon under level wont scale up to level in the battle tree that would make that mimikyu very fast under tr
pokemon,not_removed,i went on pgl and couldnt find the code for the ball
pokemon,not_removed,well there is redblue
pokemon,not_removed,youre saying im bad at the game i guess
pokemon,not_removed,okay thanks ill give your team a shot ill get back to you on how it goes
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,unfortunately due to the way the css is coded users cannot manually select their ballflair we have to assign it simply put theres already users with ballflairs out there with the number growing weekly due to this competition we have other moderation tasks we need to worry about beyond daily modmails from different users asking us to change their ball flair
pokemon,not_removed,heres what i usually do because i can never find the page for the rewards open a tab and login the pgl next open another tab and use this it should give you a code for the prizes
pokemon,not_removed,weak p
pokemon,not_removed,i reached the battle tree straight after the elite four my team was level just try its not that hard
pokemon,not_removed,last mission people that joined but didnt get trades didnt get the friendball
pokemon,not_removed,my team is level
pokemon,not_removed,i meant to edit it into my last response after i saw another comment of yours but you replied before i could
pokemon,not_removed,okay i have to admit that reaching the battle tree would be really hard with those levels p grind some levels near the battle tree if you have defeated the elite four already and caught more than pokémon you can go talk to kuikui in his lab and he will give you a lucky egg more experience for its holder
pokemon,not_removed,but then i have to stop my egg grind
pokemon,not_removed,im wanting to play though all the games and cam across these
pokemon,not_removed,prosibly for real tho i can tell you that its not
pokemon,not_removed,caleb for really real how can i be sure
pokemon,not_removed,its been proven that ultra beasts arent human or pokémon they do have a connection to humans however is that enough jeca
pokemon,not_removed,wheres the info on that im not trying to prove anything im just genuinely curious haha
pokemon,not_removed,well they clearly arent human and no typing has been shown and if they were pokémon they would have said that by now also theres no denying the connection between and lillie
pokemon,not_removed,it was that connection that made me think of this actually they arent human or pokemon but both
pokemon,not_removed,ashs bulbasaur he was the very best bulbasaur like no one ever was
pokemon,not_removed,how do you not miss brock if you grew up watching with him in the show
pokemon,not_removed,i havent finished xy yet but so far the saddest person to leave for me was dawn she and ash were like best friends and they both helped each other out a lot it was cool seeing them work together and learn things from each other such as ash using contest moves in his gym battles she could also hold her own when she needed to and didnt rely on ash a lot and until the kalos league she came the closest of all the protagonists to accomplishing her main goal place in sinnoh grand festival the episode where she left was sad for me and if i couldve chose any character to stay with ash it wouldve been her
pokemon,not_removed,saying goodbye to butterfree wasis the saddest moment of my childhood so of course i cried during my recent rewatch one i didnt expect to be so floored by was the pikachu fakeleaving episode it had both me and my gf in tears im gonna be really sad when serena leaves provided the writers dont let her confess if she does itll give at least some closure but either way her sendoff will definitely be one of the more emotional ones you make a good point op about how she kinda was ashs gf even though hes oblivious for these past years and that made me feel a lot better about her character leaving confession or not oh one last one goodra fuck man ash helps this poor little goomy realize its true potential and then allows goodra to stay behind with wooper and co in the wetlands i know ash eventually gets goodra back for the league but still even that goodbye was sad
pokemon,not_removed,jesse and james weezing and arbok and the first time brock left
pokemon,not_removed,brock is buy and large the best character in the entire series rose tinted lenses and i cant stand the show without him ive liked both of his replacements but none as much as him also the bond between ash and his sceptile always seemed particularly strong to me which is why im sad that dynamic is gone from the show
pokemon,not_removed,misty butterfree and pidgeot sorry but damn
pokemon,not_removed,serena god damnit
pokemon,not_removed,any of the scenes where they used that traditional sad song usually had me teary that song is well crafted and it doesnt take much to put yourself in a mindset for tears after that this song incase no one knows what i am talking about edit i hope they use it for serena just because i love her so much and i want to really bawl my eyes out when she goes
pokemon,not_removed,if your answer isnt butterfree youre heartless and wrong
pokemon,not_removed,no one has said may yet and it makes me sad may by far had the best character development of any female companion and i miss her the most
pokemon,not_removed,misty pls
pokemon,not_removed,dawns piplup that oshawottpiplupmeloetta love triangle though
pokemon,not_removed,the scene where he dies in the goodbye episode was so weird
pokemon,not_removed,nothing was as sad as watching ash say goodbye to butterfree he was such a little emotional shit in the first few seasons
pokemon,not_removed,come on man its not rosetinted lenses if you dont completely bash anything that isnt him
pokemon,not_removed,dont say it lets live in our dream world for just a few more weeks
pokemon,not_removed,loud sobbing noises
pokemon,not_removed,throughout the generations he was the least picked first gen starter pokemon to me hes always the number one relevant flair checks in
pokemon,not_removed,in every generation except genv and genvii the grass starters are the least picked gotta love how everybody thought its the worst for long time during the rb days but when everybody realized its actually the best everybody took a shock but still venusaur design didnt appeal to many and it was too late that most of people got to love charmander and squirtle already and sadly the internet memes didnt help his case newcomers such as pogo players think he is the worst because facebook and memes
pokemon,not_removed,not everyone can be in bulbasaurs position he will always literally be our number
pokemon,not_removed,will be and that is a leech that sucks reddit off
pokemon,not_removed,hopefully someone can provide a better picture
pokemon,not_removed,this is the best quality i have hope this helps
pokemon,not_removed,i appreciate it hopefully a hd version will be released soon
pokemon,not_removed,thanks i hope there is a release of a full hd version its one of my favorite moments fro the game
pokemon,not_removed,same here definitely brought some feels from me
pokemon,not_removed,just link the
pokemon,not_removed,holy fuck its happening
pokemon,not_removed,this was already posted kinda loses the impact the second time
pokemon,not_removed,for a sec i was like wait isnt this just gnoggins theory but when i saw the gorilla translation i lost it
pokemon,not_removed,i lost it at spirit gorilla
pokemon,not_removed,didnt know there was one
pokemon,not_removed,where was the original post
pokemon,not_removed,same lmfao
pokemon,not_removed,i think it was yesterday
pokemon,not_removed,paralyze or put them to sleep so they cant call their friends
pokemon,not_removed,repel was invented for a reason my friend
pokemon,not_removed,then just run away jesus
pokemon,not_removed,lel
pokemon,not_removed,yea
pokemon,not_removed,the paint skills are strong with this one
pokemon,not_removed,its a ditto just pretending
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think theres even a single character i disliked this gen
pokemon,not_removed,if pokémon does one thing well its come up with puns
pokemon,not_removed,i love how plumeria calls them dumb when you first meet her she also says they are kinda cute in their dumbness to which i fully agree
pokemon,not_removed,definitely a whole better than fatty danceatron coconut pokedex the great pink useless and mommy and daddys little disappointment from xy
pokemon,not_removed,reskull res kull rescue rescue team rescue is actually dead
pokemon,not_removed,this is the only generation of games where i actually cared about anyone beyond the rivalpcprofessor
pokemon,not_removed,team skull wants to make a rescue team im on board with this pmd reference whether it was intended or not
pokemon,not_removed,team reskull should be the focus of the next pokémon ranger game
pokemon,not_removed,team skull has been the most likeable out of any of the team x
pokemon,not_removed,new pokemon ranger featuring team reskull confirmed
pokemon,not_removed,olivia is smokin hot my favorite character in the game
pokemon,not_removed,the only way the two team skull bros could be any better is if they get i laughed my ass off during their reveal in this video
pokemon,not_removed,i want an animated spinoff with these guys now
pokemon,not_removed,imagine pokemon eclipse where team reskull is the good guys doing the aether foundations job and the aether foundation has become some sort of eco terrorist cell
pokemon,not_removed,reformed
pokemon,not_removed,this game really is getting you on crazy levels guysgiven i really adore pokemonif i happen to get enough cash i sure may be willing to straightaway buy all the games i havent so far played yet but by the way you are taliking about this one is it really so magnificent
pokemon,not_removed,i really hated lusamine but because she was a greatly written villain if anything my hatred for her proves shes a great character
pokemon,not_removed,mina comes out of nowhere does nothing gets no development if they had even just made her the poni island elite four rep that would have been a step up from what we got with her
pokemon,not_removed,faba
pokemon,not_removed,slight spoilers if you havent finished the game i didnt enjoy kahili being in the elite vs another kahuna or trial master that we fought earlier in the game i was really wanting hapu to be an member but a ground and a rock one would present too many weaknesses i guess it just bugs me how at least in my playthrough there was maybe one mention of kahili the entire game if that i dont even remember seeing her name before the but we fight all these amazingly developed trial captains and kahunas and instead of all four of the elite being them we get some golfer chick who wasnt a part of the story for the entire game was a huge letdown for me i loved hala olivia and acerola being part of the but i really really dont enjoy kahili so id have to say shes probably a disliked character for me
pokemon,not_removed,i miss lillie
pokemon,not_removed,now that i think about it i agree with you the last time i felt like this about a video game was skyrim back in from the pre release hype to the fulfillment of discovering every little detail about the game gf really outdone themselves this time lets hope the stars rumors are true
pokemon,not_removed,thoughts on hau found him to be pretty damn lame and worthless for the story losing to plumeria to get lillie captured i mean come on was very pleased to have gladion as a legit rival
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt really like gladion the edgelord
pokemon,not_removed,personally im finding myself disliking a lot of the other major npcs not because of how theyre written but just because of the frequency at which they interrupt gameplay i know this gen is putting an emphasis on story which is cool but i guess its just not really what i personally want in a pokémon game im still enjoying it though
pokemon,not_removed,faba is an annoying dick fuck faba
pokemon,not_removed,to me hau couldve not existed and i would be more than happy
pokemon,not_removed,nemu i hate him he does nothing but complain about having to do stuff
pokemon,not_removed,my favorite secret evolution for magneton
pokemon,not_removed,you have realized what idiots all these guys are right
pokemon,not_removed,i wish there was more of her in game she doesnt do much post game either
pokemon,not_removed,fun fact you can meet your rivals parent in xy it is a regular old ace trainer in snowbelle who says that their kid just started on a journey and is about the same age as you also if playing as a girl they refer to him as a boy and if playing as a boy they refer to her as a girl
pokemon,not_removed,they die and become pokemon in the mystery dungeon spin off
pokemon,not_removed,new this summer pokémon a and pokémon b now featuring team x
pokemon,not_removed,did you know that shes still single
pokemon,not_removed,oh my god i never realized how much i wanted this until i watched that video
pokemon,not_removed,for as down on himself about voice acting as jack is he really can be funny
pokemon,not_removed,it changes a lot of things in great ways hms that took up moveslots have been replaced with a device that just calls a pokémon to you with the ability you need surf fly rock smash etc the evil team doesnt have some grand plan to take over the world or anything and characters actually change and grow over the course of the story
pokemon,not_removed,so pretty much ruin everything about them we dont need more minions
pokemon,not_removed,somehow that evil smile she did well how can i say this i got boner
pokemon,not_removed,her actions were outright disturbing and wrong but i dont really hate her after hearing tidbits on her backstory and the effects of nihilegos toxins if anything i feel bad for her and her family for going through so much i dont really think theres a true villain in this game just actions and consequences of a person escalating into disaster
pokemon,not_removed,she was written to be the character you lave to hate
pokemon,not_removed,she is an alright design and plays her part but shes about as well written as a character from a soap opera
pokemon,not_removed,shes a character you love to hate
pokemon,not_removed,shes the first person to give me physical disgust in a pokemon game the writing is great
pokemon,not_removed,she does a bit in the postgame
pokemon,not_removed,eh he was pretty well written as a villain and the scene where he realizes he brought the key directly to the heroes is fantastic
pokemon,not_removed,who
pokemon,not_removed,actually she was forshadowed throughout the game the big fancy hotel next to a golf cour only visible on the map jas numerous npc talking about her and her father owns the hotel also the woman that gives you a free aerodactyl mentions her although without remembering her name it is indeed very subtle but i guess the players who picked up on those clues would feel immensly satisfied if they were able to see her coming
pokemon,not_removed,to be fair though thats the case for the rest of the franchise the members in the previous games were a lot more bland and you dont even get a hint on of them at least in this one they were more fleshed out
pokemon,not_removed,opposite i liked kahili the best because i didnt know her acerola gets a pass because we never get to fight her and thats cool really meh on hala and olivia tbh i love hala but not huge on olivia especially with how easy to beat she is like maybe this is where we should have fought molayne instead of the observatory
pokemon,not_removed,acerola being there in place of nanu was perfect and her dialogue explaining it was great
pokemon,not_removed,most or all of the other games have previously irrelevant elite four characters you may meet like one or two
pokemon,not_removed,i actually kind of liked that she came out of nowhere i didnt see her or acerola coming when i came to the elite four i had prepared my team expecting hapu to be in the so i had to scramble to get myself ready for this random flyingtype chick not as much scrambling for acerola most of my team had moves that were good for dealing with ghosts even though i was expecting nanu instead i guess im also just kind of used to the elite four being well basically just four random trainers the only elite four member i can think of that was not just some random guy is koga and even then he only has significance if you remember him from gen sumo was cool in that were actually people you knew and respected from the earlier parts of the game but that doesnt make kahili bad for not being in the game before the
pokemon,not_removed,i couldnt bring myself to dislike hau hes like a really dumb puppy thats high on life couldnt outsmart a bag of rocks but the idiocy is adorable i kinda find his ability to be stoked as hell for everything enviable
pokemon,not_removed,i got pretty annoyed with hau at points he was way too happy throughout that whole aether foundation mission and in a double battle against a pelipper and mudsdale he made his raichu use psychic against the mudsdale instead of just taking out the pelipper in one hit like wtf dude
pokemon,not_removed,im personally eating it up im a sucker for cut scenes and dialogue even seemingly pointless dialogue is often interesting to me however youre definitely not alone one of my friends almost flips out whenever lillie interrupts the game with a cut scene
pokemon,not_removed,i got that way with lillie she started to annoy me with how much she was interrupting my journey hau i liked for the free exp hed just battle you and wander off
pokemon,not_removed,you have a rival in xy
pokemon,not_removed,lol you know i usually save before the gym leader cause im cautious like thatbut i let olivia beat me the first time me and her battled but then again the competitor in me wouldnt allow defeat so i soft reset and gave it to her anyways i would love for my character to wife her even though my character is a twelve year old girl its so weird
pokemon,not_removed,so we could even be saying its the first great pokemon game historywise since a while ago isnt it
pokemon,not_removed,yeah minions are a plague on the internet username unrelated mine user was based off a nickname not the yellow tater tots
pokemon,not_removed,what a beautiful alola
pokemon,not_removed,shes evil nothing says she cant be hot too she this games milf
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,kono stando
pokemon,not_removed,like a crazy cynthia
pokemon,not_removed,well my man there is a subreddit just for people like you ill give you a hint it starts with poke and ends with porn
pokemon,not_removed,nic cage voice that was the plan
pokemon,not_removed,scaroused
pokemon,not_removed,someone needs to watch some future diary
pokemon,not_removed,we all did ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
pokemon,not_removed,ash youre crazy where did your dignity and pride go gotta catchem all
pokemon,not_removed,especially when she fused with
pokemon,not_removed,i just have an unhealthy love of wellwritten broken characters watching her collapse in on herself like a narcissistic neutron star was amazing
pokemon,not_removed,indaad
pokemon,not_removed,seriously though im baffled at all the praise characters are getting in sunmoon they arent bad but they are no where near deep or meaningful or well written
pokemon,not_removed,in the postgame she comes out of nowhere says something vague and mysterious and then still gets no development
pokemon,not_removed,damn youve convinced me ha
pokemon,not_removed,hes dumber than hau hau
pokemon,not_removed,hed probably be the leader of a new evil organization next game he has potential to be a the next villain but he would probably be overshadowed by someone even better like with ghetsis and colress or something similar
pokemon,not_removed,ganon
pokemon,not_removed,i dont even think i explored that hotel while playing oops i just feel like they could have given the position to any other captain that we faced during the story and it would have been so much better kahili was a huge disappointment to me since it feels like shes just shoehorned in rather than picking from the numerous trial captains we had ilma would have been great as would have kiawe or lana or mallow
pokemon,not_removed,theres a few teases throughout about there being a strong flying type trainer at various points i think theres definitely one at the sea village though it would have been nice to have been able to see her on the golf course so the golf course wasnt just a thing on the map with no real context
pokemon,not_removed,i was pretty surprised she was only a member in games before gen a character whispered about like that usually ends up being the champion
pokemon,not_removed,and she was mentioned in the demo the person next to the clothes shop talks about how kahili is an awesome golf player and trainer and is out conquering the world but they hope shell return soon wish granted npc
pokemon,not_removed,its normal for the franchise as a whole but it wasnt normal for sun and moon thats the difference
pokemon,not_removed,thats true i feel like kahili is super bland though i wasnt invested in the battle because i had never seen her before which for these games was something i was familiar with since there were so many recurring battles with trainers she honestly just felt like just another trainer to me
pokemon,not_removed,yeah nanu and acerola are defintely favorites from this game i love the contrasts between their personalities and the reason him not being there was just i couldnt choose to be a kahuna but i can choose whether or not to do this and i dont want to
pokemon,not_removed,idk it just seems with the general trend of strongest trainers in alola plus with all the other members being kahunas or trial masters kahili just really doesnt fit in as youve never seen her before i get that with other games it was the same where you didnt know any of the prior to it but with sumo building the it just threw me off seeing one of the strongest alolan trainers at only that one point during the story
pokemon,not_removed,flint has a minor role in dppt you meet him upon arriving to sunyshore and again after the elite four at the battle frontier
pokemon,not_removed,he outsmarted faba
pokemon,not_removed,its also just a lack of depth and character growth he would make a decent side character but as a rival he leaves a lot to be desired if he was like the shauna of the group it wouldnt have been so bad but hes the one doing everything in tandem with you the one challenging you in the league the one challenging you right before the elite four and the one going step for step with you all game i dont hate him persay im just disappointed in him and find him incredibly boring when the rotom dex says dont you miss hau im like no not even a little but i miss the hell out of lillie and gladion
pokemon,not_removed,thats not a terrible idea on his part if your pokemon was neutral to both his ai chose to go after the bigger threat with a move that would hit it hard since mudsdale is a mostly physical wall that can easily ohko a raichu if anything hes looking at you being like hey raichu can soak a hurricane or hydro pump why did my pokemon just eat an earthquake bud
pokemon,not_removed,he was way too happy throughout that whole aether foundation mission as opposed to the multifaceted personality of the main character
pokemon,not_removed,way too happy and way too weak the fact that he took the starter weak to your starter didnt help either
pokemon,not_removed,ironically hau did everything i asked him too in all of my double battles so i didnt really have that issue the fact that he calls out gladion on his edginess and faba on his stupidity won some more points from me
pokemon,not_removed,i like the emphasis on the story but some of these cut scenes take freaking forever to get through its super annoying when i want to save the game and quit for a while but i cant because the cut scene that started two minutes ago is still going on with no end in sight
pokemon,not_removed,its just at the point for me where whenever i see lillie in a new town i dread walking forward because i dont want to click all the way through her cutscene lol
pokemon,not_removed,technically
pokemon,not_removed,you can have diner with her though
pokemon,not_removed,id say its the best but i dont want to build up your expectations if you like pokémon youll like sun and moon
pokemon,not_removed,chew
pokemon,not_removed,im sorry but i cant hear her over how thicc wicke is
pokemon,not_removed,oohh yes
pokemon,not_removed,risky click of the day
pokemon,not_removed,nah its rstardustcrusaders
pokemon,not_removed,gt
pokemon,not_removed,iv seen it
pokemon,not_removed,god when you enter her private study and see that she froze her original team to keep them beautiful foreverthats right up there with ghetsis intentionally abusing a child to turn them into a messiah figure to take over a country
pokemon,not_removed,exactly i love broken characters
pokemon,not_removed,im actually giving guzma even more credit on this one hes the first enemy team boss with an actual grievance guzma is a captaincyqualified trainer who was denied a legitimate governance position presumably by the disapproval of a rare animal guzma in response organizes team skull runs an island kahuna out of town and sets up shop in the kahunas house guzma works with the aether foundation because he needs a powerful weapon to solidify his standing not for any allegiance to lusamine hell he presumably hides gladion and type null from her for years before lillie leaves the foundation with cosmog guzmas glaring oversight is that his manhattan project is being run by a pyromaniac who really likes explosions i think its also worth contrasting kukui and guzma since kukui is also a captaincylevel trainer without any official status guzma establishes himself as an island captain he specializes in one type he forms a monopoly on the zcrystals for that type he establishes a territory wherein he can limit route access basically he mimics the established system even if he does so without the consent of that system the professor on the other hand works from within the existing alolan system to actively replace it not content to be live vicariously through the masked royal kukui takes it upon himself to put together an elite four constituting an entirely new form of governing body in alola and installs himself as the presumptive champion his signature pokemon are a rocktype for guzmas bugs and whichever starter has a type advantage over the player the two characters who stand in kukuis way to hegemony in alola
pokemon,not_removed,i think its mostly because of the structure of pokemon games limiting their story telling they need to place focus on gymstrialsthe league while also pacing a plot between it all so it usually gets boiled down to i want to rule the world using x legendary for what its worth lusamine managed to feel a step above the usual pokemon villain and the fact that they actually squeezed in a couple character arcs was pretty nice
pokemon,not_removed,thats the franchise in general even sm are just above average and still outdated compared to its competition the fanbase however is entirely blind to most criticism of the games
pokemon,not_removed,isnt she from the home where the snubbull ate the painting i was expecting more from that character
pokemon,not_removed,if its suppose to be mysterious do you need development all will be clear later on
pokemon,not_removed,i never thought hau was dumb
pokemon,not_removed,probably be overshadowed by someone even better ahh ye ol ganon formula
pokemon,not_removed,emboar
pokemon,not_removed,ironically she was the only actually decently difficult person in the the kahunas teams were jokes
pokemon,not_removed,that squat though
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think you can even get to it
pokemon,not_removed,the champion usually appears directly though while members usually do not appear before you fight them i think flint from sinnoh is the exception here
pokemon,not_removed,i loved that because all we knew about this character was plays golf trying to take over the world and i really wanted to see who she would be
pokemon,not_removed,i was just incredibly satisfied seeing this character who i remembered being mentioned by other npcs finally make an appearance yeah if we had another kahuna the battle might be more meaningful but the kahunas already had their chance to shine its nice seeing the world building and kahunas and captains arent the only strong trainers around that an alluded to previously unseen character brings for me anyway
pokemon,not_removed,nanu is a slob who shouldnt be a kahuna his job as island kahuna is to make sure routes stay open to test trainers and to protect the islands pokemon he does none of these aside from guzma rolling him running him out of town and living in his house team skull has closed roads and abducted pokemon although stufful seems fine honestly across his island when the player character assaults po town nanu accedes to your death wishhobbesian divine mandate without so much as a good luck have fun its probably his fault that the thrifty mart killed a bunch of people
pokemon,not_removed,i know what you mean but it was probably a typing issue rock and ground are too similar and nanu is to savage to be an e member
pokemon,not_removed,i dunno if thats a testament to haus intelligence or fabas lack thereof
pokemon,not_removed,idk man i mean i already had bloom doom set to go on the mudsdale but the raichu outsped me couldve been a oneturn battle
pokemon,not_removed,which was also appalling the fact that the mc got less emotive in the subsequent gen is just terrible more than once i was extremely annoyed by that blank smile on your face youre a legit sociopath
pokemon,not_removed,i think the easy fix is the implementation of a skip button more player freedom is almost never a bad thing and im not sure why they didnt allow any easier option to breeze through scenes hopefully they fix that in the next installment
pokemon,not_removed,nice i just beat the game earlier today i was avoiding game spoilers didnt know you can have dinner with her thank you
pokemon,not_removed,goddamn i cant fucking help feeling regretful for not having chosen to be given instead of a vitaas much as i do actually love my vitai guess switch will fix my mood up xd
pokemon,not_removed,there must be no other place as pretty as this region
pokemon,not_removed,this feeling i feel it deeply
pokemon,not_removed,is wicke a milf though and is she the mother of the best girl of this generation not that any of it matters lusamine is bae
pokemon,not_removed,rkilllakill
pokemon,not_removed,annnnnnd subscribed
pokemon,not_removed,oh man rhomestuck in rpokemon what is this
pokemon,not_removed,jesus christopher kringlefucker
pokemon,not_removed,gen irked me so badly with ghetsis n was amazing and a very compelling character the sages as a whole were a pretty interesting concept team plasma as a whole had a lot of grunts who sincerely thought they were doing the right thing and in the postgame some of them even reflect on their actions ghetsiss early actions have pretty compelling motivations but then leading up to and during your big showdown with him you find out the whole thing was a cover and he was just a common megalomaniac wanting to rule the lands
pokemon,not_removed,shower thought could the skull symbol for team skull be a reference to the tapus all the tapus closed forms resemble the heads of animals guzmas symbol is his own tapu
pokemon,not_removed,id give you gold if i had money
pokemon,not_removed,i agree with you about guzma but you see way more i love lillie posts than anything else and lillie was dull and singlefaceted
pokemon,not_removed,to be fair no one plays pokemon for the plot even the twist of aether being the real villain team was predicted the day aether was revealed the game opening with lillie running from aether grunts and lusamine throwing up giant red flags when you first meet her dont help either even if its not up to the standards of other games in general its still one of the better plots in the pokemon series for starters we get character development and emotional attachment bw is its only real inseries competition on the story front imo
pokemon,not_removed,what are some better written modernday jrpgs
pokemon,not_removed,i mean we didnt get any games for years what did you expect
pokemon,not_removed,inever found that house i think i ran into her in poni gauntlet as the last beat everyone on the route first trainer then swept her team with metagross
pokemon,not_removed,she is and i did too but alas maybe shell be more important in future games since game freak loves to do that shit now
pokemon,not_removed,depends on if you consider naivety dumb
pokemon,not_removed,really i had no problem with her using a vikavolt used her skarmory to set up agilities then swept the rest of her team i had more problems with olivia since i had a bunch of fire and bug types on my team
pokemon,not_removed,this is actually true her mandibuzz is insanely tanky and it has toxic roost to boot
pokemon,not_removed,exactly the golf course is such a bad red herring
pokemon,not_removed,k
pokemon,not_removed,yeah would have been great for ilma though since he would be the first normal type member if im not mistaken
pokemon,not_removed,a skip feature would be nice at the very least the devs could have spaced out the ridiculously long cut scenes a bit i hate it when i finish a cut scene and walk two paces thereby triggering another cut scene it feels a bit never ending sometimes
pokemon,not_removed,hau no dignity
pokemon,not_removed,she was more of a mother than lusamine was
pokemon,not_removed,see i loved that about him ghetsis motivations were similar to past villains but he was successful for a period of time and his plans were more than get box legendary and succeed he successfully manipulated hundreds of people rallied a movement behind himself to give him the moral authority to move on the establishment and only when ultimately confronted after he achieved his goals did he break down and reveal the true villain he is much better compared to galactic and their universe rewriting because of reasons or aquamagma destroy the planet because we like water or land a lot
pokemon,not_removed,lillie started dull and then emotionally matured characters that you watch grow are often more compelling
pokemon,not_removed,i was confused when i saw team skull as i assumed aether was the villain all along
pokemon,not_removed,grinning aether grunts at that no doubt at all about them being bad news
pokemon,not_removed,of course no one plays it for the plot they could get far better decades ago the writing has always been bad is not an argument and only proves my overall point also character development does not equate to depth or quality at all this has become a narrative crutch little more than a near buzzword emotional attachment is also entirely subjective i just want a great pokemon game that isnt outdated before its even in development but this cycle of praising poor quality will only allow them to pump out more mediocre games i mean why would they waste time making something great when people buy decent
pokemon,not_removed,there were very few special attackers it felt like vikavolt is one thing that would make her easy but the majority of teams just get walled by her entirely physical defense based team between skarmorymandibuzz and beak blast burning everybody i could barely do any damage to her team but luckily i made my aegislash special based and had a gastrodon with ice beam but i came close to losing i dont think i lost a single pokemon to any of the other first playthrough
pokemon,not_removed,i have the most trouble with hala because of my lack of flying or psychic types i have two ghosts but that bewear his hard with shadow claw
pokemon,not_removed,yea her team used a lot of legitimate physical stall threats like mandibuzz and skarmory beak blast is very annoying too that toucannon wiped like half my team by itself
pokemon,not_removed,r
pokemon,not_removed,i am the fucking champion
pokemon,not_removed,thats true
pokemon,not_removed,i liked cyrus but oh my god i had no idea why anyone in team galactic was following him i want a world where everyone is an emotionless husk with no passion and human spirit is gone so we can be productive but then most of his followers were passionate people with strong desires also i think maxies approach has always been far more reasonable than archies archie basically wanted a doomsday flood to wipe away the world so i can see where a particular bunch of insane cultists would join him but most of team aqua were not zealots maxies approach was more well of the planet is covered in water and thats a waste what if we had access to more land and more resources and even if that has a lot of glaring geologicalenvironmental holes in it its at least a more agreeable notion than a cleansing flood
pokemon,not_removed,to be honest most of the galactic grunts and even friggin saturn didnt know the extent of cyrus plans
pokemon,not_removed,so did nearly everyone else from the moment they were revealed in the trailer
pokemon,not_removed,it sounds like youre complaining about the campaign plot in what is ultimately a pvp focused game honestly
pokemon,not_removed,i had a very hard time against olivia both during the first time you fight her and the battle but that was also because my team had fire types and bug types with a tsareena and a palossand that got wrecked by probopass and lycanrocnight that and i didnt really go in fully prepared the first time
pokemon,not_removed,i had no problem with alolan raichu and ninetails
pokemon,not_removed,i used my salazzle against bewear flamethrower hits that fluffy ability hard
pokemon,not_removed,hau has already touched that malasada
pokemon,not_removed,agreed with you there the head villain motivation was usually detached from the rest of the organization and are often unrealisticwont work the way they planned only ones where the organization seemed on point with their leader were rocket and flare plasma and skull werent but at least they were being misled by their respective leaders
pokemon,not_removed,thats why i loved black and white its like gamefreak realized that their villains needed more fleshing out ever since then theyve done a lot in giving their villains motivation even if its silly looking at you lysander and team flare in fact one of the things i loved about lusamine is that she has multiple motivations depending on your read of her missing husband it gets dark but none of them are ultimately evil per se
pokemon,not_removed,no i presented clear complaints that you seem to want to ignore
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i have marowak but i dont really like the recoil of flare blitz so i use flame charge not powerful enough to one shot then he hits me with a shadow claw and its too close for comfort
pokemon,not_removed,incineroar ha sallready thouched the pokeball
pokemon,not_removed,now that seems more fitting to cyruss personality
pokemon,not_removed,nah i think everyone understood guzma pretty well
pokemon,not_removed,black and white was cool black and white had the worst motivations since gen team rocket especially zinzolin literally what the fuck zinzolin but hey it gave us rood and his doggo i liked his implication and the fact he was actively looking to redeem himself i liked the idea of the seven sages and then you only end up battling two as an enemy one being ghetsis black and white was full of wasted opportunities black white was a good game with a terrible evil team team aquas idea was dumb as hell but they were likeable and had a cool design woo pirates
pokemon,not_removed,and i find it easy to simply gloss over them because the plot is ultimately a secondary concern to me ill freely admit it could be better but im not too fussed over it to look at it a different way i went in with low expectations so i really cant complain it was better than i was expecting can i even if better isnt omg this is the best plot ever
pokemon,not_removed,considering that plumeria apologizes for what team skull did after guzmas disappearance and specifically because they didnt know what guzma wanted cosmog for that seems to me like they were misled they absolutely understood him as an individual and his goals of proving himself in a world that he ran away from but they absolutely did not understand why he was with aether foundation
pokemon,not_removed,literally money so he could get some kind of crazy super monster and prove how strong he is i dont think he even knew cosmog existed up until just before the confrontation with lusamine
pokemon,not_removed,that makes no sense considering team skull was looking for cosmog prior to her kidnapping kidnapped lillie because she had cosmog and then apologized for kidnapping cosmog and lillie after the first confrontation
pokemon,not_removed,didnt they just say they wanted the rare pokemon they figured she had plumaria seems more on top of things than guzma so she was probably the only one who knew what they were hired to steal
pokemon,not_removed,nope they said they were looking for a cosmog from the get go when that story arc started
pokemon,not_removed,huh i guess they were all on the same page then huh
pokemon,not_removed,nope because they also say they dont know why the boss wants it no need to be a condescending dick though
pokemon,not_removed,doesnt guzma also say he has no clue why lusamine wants it
pokemon,not_removed,i dont believe so but i could be mistaken
pokemon,not_removed,thatfreakinhairi thought it was on my screen
pokemon,not_removed,automodmods if youre gonna remove a post because its a repost please provide source i really wanted to know what one of the funniest pokédex entries was c
pokemon,not_removed,how long have you had that
pokemon,not_removed,haha they shouldve added in and programmed it to play right after you read that entry
pokemon,not_removed,pokedex has evolved too 😘 love it
pokemon,not_removed,pokedex entry for anyone who found this after it was removed its milk is high in calories and packed with nutrients therefore if you drink too much of it you may wind up with a body like miltanks
pokemon,not_removed,sassydex
pokemon,not_removed,where can i get some you know for science hides evil smile
pokemon,not_removed,can confirm tried to wipe off the hair
pokemon,not_removed,about four years
pokemon,not_removed,reconfirming
pokemon,not_removed,ever planning on getting a new one
pokemon,not_removed,not now maybe in two or three years
pokemon,not_removed,i remember buying a just for the sake of playing pokémon x in a wide screen talking about nintendo handhelds of course its like wine
pokemon,not_removed,it goes on for a while theres an encounter after the league and then you have to also sit through the credits no skippingresetting the game before itll autosave best thing to do is just put the on charge and go to sleep and then deal with it in the morning
pokemon,not_removed,i want more of these
pokemon,not_removed,there are about ten of these on the pokemon youtube channel rn
pokemon,not_removed,as the leader of the bulbasaur fan club hell love it
pokemon,not_removed,he is naked where is his bulb hes just asaur
pokemon,not_removed,ahh yes burts bees honey flavored lip balm a favorite of bulbasaurs
pokemon,not_removed,reminds me of makes me happy
pokemon,not_removed,well it is a wip
pokemon,not_removed,he is cold dont take too long
pokemon,not_removed,i think pokemon based on inanimate objects can look good when the designs are kept simplistic but i feel that way about organismbased pokemon as well for example i find trubbish cute despite being a bag of trash because the design was kept simple and kind of goofy looking whereas i dont like probopass because the design took nosepass and upped it another for no real reason either i wouldnt mind a region with animalexclusive pokemon but being animalbased doesnt exclude them from being ugly or dumb looking
pokemon,not_removed,i think that the lack of object or plant based pokemon in a region would detract from the variety found in a pokemon game i think it comes down to a case by case basis of design personally ive always felt that probopass was intentionally designed to be ridiculous
pokemon,not_removed,personally i think object pokemon are the more creative of the designs and they usually have really interesting lore what i dislike the most is actually humanoid pokemon i detest mr mime in particular and most of the fightingtypes are not attractive to me i actually wasnt a fan of raltskirliagardevoir until i was forced to use one in a nuzlocke id be happy with a purely animalbased region as long as they dont make them too personlike
pokemon,not_removed,inanimate objectbased pokemon are frequently some of the most unique creative designs that the franchise has and a generation lacking them would be severely missing out if anything id more or less be fine with the reverse as in a generation of only nonanimal pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,i see where youre coming from but i personally would miss the variety
pokemon,not_removed,it wouldnt bother me but ive noticed i tend to really only used animal based pokemon when i play the games though i do wanna try using a magnemite sometime
pokemon,not_removed,i would definitely mind especially if you exclude nonanimal organisms i find the inorganic designs more intriguing than say a quadrupedal mammal design if you are going pick animals pick the interesting ones
pokemon,not_removed,yes i would mind they can make some really cool object based pokemon theres chandelure cofagrigus and i should even count metagross they should try out new things and see what will happen just because a pokemon isnt based on a living creature it doesnt mean its unoriginal in fact it might even be more original than a simple animal everyone would accept a dragon as a pet but only a few would say that hey lets make a living coffin and i really want a train pokemon for example
pokemon,not_removed,no diversity is what pokemon is known for
pokemon,not_removed,depends on the animal to be honest if they were all wellknown standard animals like horses and foxes and dogs and cats gross if they drew inspiration from things like honeypot ants narwhals hawk wasps and gulper eels sign me up
pokemon,not_removed,i really wouldnt like that it would probably end up being my least favourite region for new pokemon because i often end up using at least one sometimes more non animals in my team cofagrigus reuniclus trevenant magnezone etc so yeah that would be a big turn off
pokemon,not_removed,i honestly dont care as long as the designs are good and adhere to the original style my biggest beef with a lot of the new designs is that theyre so overdesigned and hyperstylized that they dont even look like they belong in the same universe as the originals that being said i do generally prefer pokemon based on plants and animals
pokemon,not_removed,i really dont know why this bias against objectbased pokemon came from i really dont they can be just as cool as every other if designed the right way its not like animal pokemon are always flawless either think about seel and krabby theyre literally just a seal and a crab
pokemon,not_removed,id definitely mind i prefer inorganic designs id be more interested in seeing a region with a majority of inorganic designs if anything and there should be more nonanimal organism designs as well maybe some more unique varieties of plants or some nonmushroom fungus designs also i think garbodor and probopass actually look better than trevenant and magnezone
pokemon,not_removed,i dont really care either way ive never been for or against either animate or inanimatebased pokemon also just my opinion but i really like garbordor better than muk at least
pokemon,not_removed,for some reason i thought the title said religion and expected a very different conversation
pokemon,not_removed,i will be seriously disappointed if there isnt an object based pokemon that disappoints me in the upcoming game i also need something cute that is completely ruined by a hideous evolution i kind of enjoy hating some of them each go through that said mr mime can go
pokemon,not_removed,no inanimate object pokemon are the best kinds but really i dont mind either type
pokemon,not_removed,its not that animal based are flawless its that animal based are like good fine bad inanimate are and humanoid are shite
pokemon,not_removed,ive noticed that most of the ghost type inanimate objects dont get as much complaints like chandelure drifblim and aegislash
pokemon,not_removed,im kind of a genwunner and even i think mr mime is probably the worst pokemon thats ever happened i also thoroughly dislike hitmonchan and jinx mr mime wins out because it also has the worst name in the game
pokemon,not_removed,yeah this is something i really dont understand when people say something based on an inanimate object isnt original or that theyre running out of ideas i would have thought it takes more creativity and inspiration to decide to turn a key ring into a pokemon versus turning a lion into a pokemon fair enough if you think a design is ugly but a pokemon being ugly or being based on a concept you dont like doesnt automatically make it uninspired or an indication that game freak are running out of ideas i mean animals are blatantly obvious sources of inspiration for new pokemontheyre only really creative or inspired if theyre based on some kind of obscure animal
pokemon,not_removed,it may be due to the lore behind them as many are inanimate objects possessed by ghost pokemon which explains some of their strange or intricate appearances
pokemon,not_removed,and sometimes even ghost humans
pokemon,not_removed,luxray xray vision sounds kinda cool
pokemon,not_removed,lucarios would be nice reading auracreating spheres of physical aura to hit your opponent with
pokemon,not_removed,time travel is a cool option and all but i think i prefer space travel hoopas hoops would be more convenient in my daytoday life not enough space in my room i can use a hoop to send my stuff to a private location essentially providing extra storage space woke up late and missed class well i cant turn back time but i can use a hoop to watch the rest of the lecture from my room trying to help someone move hoop dont want to walk to the grocery store hoop went to the bathroom but forgot my phone hoop too lazy to reach for the remote hoop
pokemon,not_removed,gardevoir teleport black holes levitate so much more
pokemon,not_removed,magikarp with everstone no questions asked
pokemon,not_removed,anything with heal pulse to help my friends
pokemon,not_removed,toxapex would also be cool poison my foes with a forcefield
pokemon,not_removed,latias or latios invisibilty flight shapeshifting telepathy on top of all the regular powers from moves like psychic and such between all their different incarnations they seem to have freakin everything in their toolkit if nonlegendary only then thats a much harder choice maybe a psychictype for teleportation zoroark to torment my enemies with illusions or luxray for xray vision and the ability to never run out of battery
pokemon,not_removed,arceus i wouldnt mind being a god
pokemon,not_removed,alakazam i would be smart my own good
pokemon,not_removed,greninjas pretty cool natural camouflage with an egg move at least water constructs sneaking around in other peoples shadows and if abbilities are counted shifting type all the time to screw with other people
pokemon,not_removed,mews ability psychic and the ability to transform and have a roll the dice metronome move yes pls xx
pokemon,not_removed,isnt there a person with those powers in the movie with lucario
pokemon,not_removed,makes sense when i think of dialga i dont think time travelthats more celebis thing but time manipulation then if running late i can show time down for super speed if im waiting i can speed it up miss something turn it back slightly stuff like that
pokemon,not_removed,i forgot about black holes
pokemon,not_removed,mine is so much more selfish than yours
pokemon,not_removed,i know it is way harder if you rule out legendaries almost impossible with so many choices
pokemon,not_removed,the lati cant shape shift they bend light instead to create illusions including an illusion of being human or invisible
pokemon,not_removed,what if you had to pick a nonlegend
pokemon,not_removed,haha what would you do with your enormous iq
pokemon,not_removed,dont forget the ability that you as a human would have to turn into ash haha
pokemon,not_removed,i have no idea the only two pokémon movies ive seen are the first and second whats the movie with lucario i gotta watch it now that i know it exists
pokemon,not_removed,to protect its trainer it will use all of its energy to create a miniature black hole
pokemon,not_removed,meh i know bending light is the morecanon explanation according to the dex and adventures manga but it doesnt line at all up at all with how we see latias in the anime she touches people fairly frequently without arousing any suspicion and other things that shouldnt be possible without some secondary powers its probably just extreme artistic liberties and handwaving but they made the whole thing look mechanically identical to actual shapeshifting i think they even call it shapeshifting in the movie though its been too long to be sure
pokemon,not_removed,ditto because then i can transform into other pokemon and use their powers
pokemon,not_removed,help with bigger problems such as seeing if its possible to cure cancer and being able to live just about forever who knows maybe even have fun with it and create a hyper realistic virtual reality without the need of headphoneseyewear
pokemon,not_removed,lucario and the mystery of new its a late advanced generation movie
pokemon,not_removed,but only if they are right in front of you
pokemon,not_removed,thanks bud do you know if i can find it on youtube
pokemon,not_removed,yeah heres the link
pokemon,not_removed,you have discovered the reason behind the report button congratulations
pokemon,not_removed,the mods are human they may not see everything they dont control what gets upvoted but they do control what can be removed the community voted on the rules the mods just enforce them that may suck but thats how it is
pokemon,not_removed,i think it would actually be pretty easy for the mods to catch these threads automatically they could easily set up automoderator to do it and it would take maybe lines of code title includes action remove comment your post was automatically removed for being a giveaway please use the appropriate megathread for all code giveaways if you feel this was done in error please contact the moderators i can sympathize with ops frustration it can certainly seem like mods are being biased even when they arent its hard to see your post removed and then another rule violatior getting away with it i like that rpokemon doesnt allow giveaways in places other than the megathread but it seems like this automod setting would be a pretty easy fix and would stop the posts from showing up entirely rather than having to rely on people reporting threads and moderators being on to remove the offending posts
pokemon,not_removed,oh for sure you dont have to tell me about it ive had a post removed for a very stupid reason it definitely seems as if they are biased but theyre just following the rules the community set into place which begs the issue of how flawed this community is at its root
pokemon,not_removed,in case any of you missed them
pokemon,not_removed,why is there an la kingsesque crown on the sharpedo
pokemon,not_removed,go empoleons

pokemon,not_removed,this is like the only sports team with pokemon post ive ever seen that manages not to put an s on the end of the pokemon names thank you for that also it looks cool
pokemon,not_removed,lets go empoleons
pokemon,not_removed,he with the best grammar wins
pokemon,not_removed,how about the cleveland escavaliers vs the golden state uh wormadams in the nba finals too bad im an oklahoma city thundurus fan
pokemon,not_removed,dark used to not hit steel very well but that has been changed so its really anybodys game and here i am wishing that he new york pokemon rangers were better
pokemon,not_removed,go atlanta hawluchas
pokemon,not_removed,as a diehard hockey fan this just made my week thanks and nice work
pokemon,not_removed,this might be a lot to ask but do you think you can make one of these for the stanley cup last year blackhawks v lightning
pokemon,not_removed,looks great i would like to see the nba finals done as well bisharp for the warriors and escavalier for the cavaliers
pokemon,not_removed,i want an vancouver kynucks jersey holding out for someone to make one
pokemon,not_removed,can pokemon please be real like now please
pokemon,not_removed,lets go empoleons
pokemon,not_removed,haha this is amazing id love the sharpedos to win
pokemon,not_removed,we may have lost last night but we are not out six more games to get four wins the cup is ours that picture is also great
pokemon,not_removed,a lot of the previous posts say i have made but i recognize some of those team logos as various youtube pokemon draft league logos sharpedos logo included a current team from the global battle association which is in season as we speak edit the current sharpedos logo is different than the one op posted but their older logo used in previous gba seasons is the exact same one featured here i dont think you made that logo or have permission to use it care to post proof or credit the actual artist same for all featured logos or at the least drop the i made this line
pokemon,not_removed,sharks use chomp it was super effective
pokemon,not_removed,sadly the damn penguins are gonna win
pokemon,not_removed,st louis seadra thats so clever
pokemon,not_removed,i know we didnt advance but im proud of the starmies for our damn good season
pokemon,not_removed,its like a victory trophy because the sharks beat the kings in round
pokemon,not_removed,you can also see the lightning on empoleon from beating the lightning the feathers from beating the capitals articuno and i think bubbles from blastoise rangers sharpedo also has seadras tail from beating the blues and raikous teeth from beating the predators
pokemon,not_removed,i think i found a rival
pokemon,not_removed,we need more sharpedos fans sharks are way cooler my home area team
pokemon,not_removed,lets go boston celebis
pokemon,not_removed,im an orlando magikarp fan
pokemon,not_removed,golden state wartortles sounds like a better fit
pokemon,not_removed,sorry for not informing you guys on this sub who created the in the previous rounds in rhockey while i made everything else he told me that he really loved them and even httpimgurcomkqhyhlr at the calgary expo and just in case you were at all wondering i would never monetize this ever i originally made these matchup illustrationswith bens logos of course out of boredom so really its all just for fun
pokemon,not_removed,the gba teams logo is from the one op made
pokemon,not_removed,now that you mention it i see it those ones were just a lot harder to identify as references
pokemon,not_removed,its like april fools all over again
pokemon,not_removed,fuck the emps sincerely a philly flying shadow shadow lugia fan
pokemon,not_removed,thats times better
pokemon,not_removed,look at the older seasons that is their new logo
pokemon,not_removed,except hockey so it is better than april fools
pokemon,not_removed,minnesota safari zones
pokemon,not_removed,fuck the emps as well washington articaps fan
pokemon,not_removed,fuck crosby in particular red wings fan
pokemon,not_removed,ah yes the style and what the sharpedo is doing is the same but the drawing is slightly different and the reason the style is the same is because theyre directly referencing the logo of the san jose sharks with sharpedo being the most obvious pokemon replacement for the team its not really all that crazy a theory that maybe more than one person thought of the idea
pokemon,not_removed,washington braviaries
pokemon,not_removed,what would you guys recommend as advice tools etc to get back up to speed on whats going on seems to go through the changes in each generation tools to mess around with movesets would be pokemon showdown competitive battling too which games should i play and which should i skip for example if you are hardcore all of them xyoras if you just want to get the sense of pokemon in those gens bw and xy only should suffice
pokemon,not_removed,get xy i myself didnt enjoy oras my least favorite region xy has a new adventure entirely
pokemon,not_removed,go to wikipedia read about the games
pokemon,not_removed,awesome thanks ill definitely give all the games a try and attempt to play through one from each generation
pokemon,not_removed,i never got to play much of the originals so ill find find out how much i like the region as i play i have had a few friends say they were a bit meh though the guy i bought the from also gave me a copy of x so if i dont enjoy ruby ill play x instead
pokemon,not_removed,last time they said that about a game it was their justification for not having a battle frontier
pokemon,not_removed,that doesnt sound good
pokemon,not_removed,qiwlfish
pokemon,not_removed,hey its fluffy mew here today id like to ask what version are you picking sun or moon what starter post your answers below dafluffymew
pokemon,not_removed,damn she thicc
pokemon,not_removed,stay fresh
pokemon,not_removed,i see way too few fanart works of meloetta this is perfectly making up for it thank youuuu
pokemon,not_removed,i approve
pokemon,not_removed,upvotes intensely
pokemon,not_removed,ive been drawing a pokemon daily and upload them to twitter for sometime but i was really proud of this one which ive been doing since yesterday in my free time
pokemon,not_removed,good job on the shading
pokemon,not_removed,my favourite
pokemon,not_removed,im actually really curious as to what you used to draw these i might just be going insane but it almost looks like soft pastels
pokemon,not_removed,these are so cute pencil drawings like this always make me wish i could draw
pokemon,not_removed,from the melodious deck in yugioh to meloetta in pokemon i still dont understand why i like them in general maybe because it based around music
pokemon,not_removed,ye
pokemon,not_removed,am i goin crazy or does she have a massive cameltoe
pokemon,not_removed,calliebestgirl
pokemon,not_removed,you got it
pokemon,not_removed,same here edit ill be the right one you be the left
pokemon,not_removed,username checks out
pokemon,not_removed,they remind me of the squid sisters this is good
pokemon,not_removed,prismacolor colored pencils pack
pokemon,not_removed,she do
pokemon,not_removed,ah a person of taste i see
pokemon,not_removed,my favorite type of meloetta
pokemon,not_removed,rbeetlejuicing
pokemon,not_removed,that was the general idea behind their poses i also wanted pirouette meloetta to make a face like maries but i couldnt pull that off
pokemon,not_removed,and that was my next guess thanks for the answer and great job
pokemon,not_removed,no problem and thanks
pokemon,not_removed,i love how they look totally like starships and pokemon at the same time also lavender engine p
pokemon,not_removed,able to destory entire worlds but never does because thats just impolite instead we just hover it over populated worlds and watch them panic themselves into oblivion also the masquerain class should have an optional hyper beam weapon module praise hyperbug
pokemon,not_removed,floette houndoom and marowak essentially killed me i love these and their captions so much
pokemon,not_removed,these are lovely now i have a craving for a pokemon themed space exploration game how low are the chances of that ever happening though
pokemon,not_removed,this really is some of the best oc brought to this subreddit in a while looking forward to more
pokemon,not_removed,awesome i like them
pokemon,not_removed,this is cool as fuck
pokemon,not_removed,oh man the marowak is my favorite but these are all amazing
pokemon,not_removed,these are fantastic really clever concepts
pokemon,not_removed,this is why i come to this sub thank you for sharing your incredible work
pokemon,not_removed,these are so cool looking have to say the marowak one looks a lot like a
pokemon,not_removed,i was thinking ftl when i saw these absolutely amazing
pokemon,not_removed,the houndoom ship reminds me of a ship in the game eve online
pokemon,not_removed,the floette looks so much like earth and beyond jenquai
pokemon,not_removed,these are awesome any chance at taking commissions or requests
pokemon,not_removed,these are super cool do you have links to anymore
pokemon,not_removed,yesssssss these are so amazing and so worth the wait for the marowak one
pokemon,not_removed,i really love your inventions especially masquerain
pokemon,not_removed,that masquiren is absolute dopeness
pokemon,not_removed,now do this with sailing ships
pokemon,not_removed,have you had any time to work on these further this is really interesting stuff and youre doing a good job we want more if you have it
pokemon,not_removed,i really want a space game with these these are beautiful
pokemon,not_removed,thank you finding the line between space craft and pokemon is difficult really trying to avoid generic spaceship but with pokemonthemed paintjob hehe i couldnt resist a good easter egg for marowak
pokemon,not_removed,tbf all fully evolved mon can use both hyper beam and giga impact i actually cant think of any fully evolved mon that can learn tms that cant learn both
pokemon,not_removed,glad you like them those turned out to be some of my favorites too thank you very much
pokemon,not_removed,those chances are astronomically low pleasedonthurtme
pokemon,not_removed,thank you very much im hoping to make one of each type so halfway there
pokemon,not_removed,thank you may take commissions after the types are complete however theyll be pricey since they take a while to draw
pokemon,not_removed,sure heres the so far
pokemon,not_removed,pssst wobbuffet
pokemon,not_removed,yeah but hyperbug had hyper beam as a surskit
pokemon,not_removed,many cant a lot of fully evolved gen pokemon cant learn hyper beam and among the ones that can are bewear and passimian because logic
pokemon,not_removed,yeah but if it ever happened it would be out of this world
pokemon,not_removed,thank you they all look amazing i think my favourite is either floette or masquerain they all look like distinctive and unique fusions of starships and pokémon ill definitely check out any more you make
pokemon,not_removed,any fully evolved mon that can learn tms wobbufet cant learn tms other than the tm moves that are in its movepool anyway the same goes for burmy wynaut unown kricketot tynamo and spewpa other than those there are a few that cant learn tms at all caterpie metapod weedle kakuna magikarp ditto smeargle wurmple silcoon cascoon beldum combee scatterbug cosmog and cosmoem
pokemon,not_removed,how
pokemon,not_removed,eyyyy haha
pokemon,not_removed,twitch plays pokemon fire red twas a randomised fire red they started with a machop with truant and route was full of surskits with hyper beams
pokemon,not_removed,i need to see this
pokemon,not_removed,im unfamiliar with those memes
pokemon,not_removed,with your haircolor you should rather make a team skull grunt cosplay
pokemon,not_removed,it doesnt matter when you ev train even if you ev train at level
pokemon,not_removed,this but if you dodid level it up from battle youll have to use a reset bag to rid of the evs most people ev train at level as to not go to the frustration of finding a reset bag
pokemon,not_removed,so the stats will not change they wont be worse if i ev train at a later level
pokemon,not_removed,theres also the ev lowering berries so one should make sure to plant lots of them
pokemon,not_removed,nope every pokemon has set base stats that depend on their level and are modified by the stats iv and how much evs are pumped into it it matters not when you decide to ev train your pokemon the stats will be same in the end the illusion of stats being different for every pokemon within a species is because people didnt used to ev train or iv breed
pokemon,not_removed,team instinct is in control of the melemele island in sunmoon valor for the red island same for mystic but for the blu island their goal is to try and get control of the pokemon league in alola by taking over this greeneclipsewhatever island the one with the giant mountain this is my new headcanon until sunmoon is released
pokemon,not_removed,congrats i just finished it up yesterday myself
pokemon,not_removed,good job now on to shinies
pokemon,not_removed,nice now onto the living dex
pokemon,not_removed,congrats
pokemon,not_removed,ah thanks i completely forgot about it
pokemon,not_removed,soft reset for a decent satk one and while i dont care for money sweeping the with nastly plot persian and this move really yields a lot of money
pokemon,not_removed,not in il says its not available for this game
pokemon,not_removed,i guess not definitely works for me in the uk as ive just gotten four of them bulbapedia mentions some of the regions covered httpbulbanewsbulbagardennetwikihappyhourmeowthavailableforpalregiongames
pokemon,not_removed,ahhh the ol u s of a is not on that list so much for freedom
pokemon,not_removed,haha i guess not in fairness you get a lot more than europe tends to
pokemon,not_removed,canada isnt either
pokemon,not_removed,yep
pokemon,not_removed,didnt claim it but note that in the future these posts should be put
pokemon,not_removed,you took it
pokemon,not_removed,nah just jumped the gun and commented first then realised the code was in the picture so it doesnt matter who asked for it then i thought hey ill try it only to remember it was for gen games not to worry i have one already
pokemon,not_removed,battle tree
pokemon,not_removed,thank you so much
pokemon,not_removed,wait nvm they dont sell it
pokemon,not_removed,you can buy it for bp from the desk npc on the far right in the battle royale building
pokemon,not_removed,best pokemon as food is venasaur cause you get a whole meal you get your vegetables and the meat
pokemon,not_removed,im not comfortable answering this question
pokemon,not_removed,gardevoir ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
pokemon,not_removed,i always wanted to eat gyarados sushi due to an inside joke between me and a friend of mine
pokemon,not_removed,gotta be farfetchd the anime even spells out that theyre nearly extinct due to being so delicious
pokemon,not_removed,slowpoke
pokemon,not_removed,basculins dex entry says it is remarkably tasty
pokemon,not_removed,vanilluxe obviously
pokemon,not_removed,miltank
pokemon,not_removed,gengar would be a good low calorie option
pokemon,not_removed,do tropius bananas count as meat
pokemon,not_removed,i feel like mew would be a rare delicacy plus it would be super tender because it flies around all the time kabby and kingler probably taste awesome as well
pokemon,not_removed,farfetchd
pokemon,not_removed,slurpuff of course
pokemon,not_removed,tauros steak
pokemon,not_removed,tauros or bouffalant
pokemon,not_removed,first thought was miltank maybe cuz i love steak
pokemon,not_removed,this is a strange question indeed probably tepig
pokemon,not_removed,blaziken since its basically fried chicken already
pokemon,not_removed,its probably because you know the answer is your flair
pokemon,not_removed,ive been trying to think up a nickname for my gyarados in oras for a while now and i think you might have inspired a name for him
pokemon,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing lol would just taste like ice cream right
pokemon,not_removed,if you enjoy eating poisonous gas
pokemon,not_removed,rip died eating poisonous gas
pokemon,not_removed,they might have meat inside you never know
pokemon,not_removed,isnt mew supposed to be an embryo
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know i dont trust precooked meat id rather grill me some miltank or magikarp
pokemon,not_removed,the muscles seem tough though i suggest combuskin because its meat seem less rigid then blaziken and a lot more tasty
pokemon,not_removed,nope no nada i can definitely say i would not like to eat umbreon
pokemon,not_removed,hah xd
pokemon,not_removed,isnt the white part of it said to be snow clouds tho and its body is said to be an icicle so itd be pretty damn hard to eat
pokemon,not_removed,you can buy them in castellia city so i imagine so
pokemon,not_removed,so low calorie youll lose all your weight instantly
pokemon,not_removed,duck embryo is a delicacy in quite a few cultures around the world pretty delicious if cooked correctly
pokemon,not_removed,looks like an embryo doesnt mean it is one reuniclus on the other hand sounds like a way more messed up thing to try and eat
pokemon,not_removed,vanilluxe for dessert
pokemon,not_removed,magikarp is said to be too bony why not go febas or whiscash instead
pokemon,not_removed,hmm true combuskens meat seems like it would be more fleshy and tastier than blazikens i hope combusken lovers dont downvote me xd
pokemon,not_removed,aw come on dont ya think it might taste good
pokemon,not_removed,me pokemon yellow no glitches
pokemon,not_removed,true reuniclus seems like itd taste likejelly
pokemon,not_removed,httpwwwserebiinetomegarubyalphasapphirelegendaryshtml
pokemon,not_removed,use serebiis site instead if the times still dont match up check to see if your clock is set right although be warned changing your clock or date will lock the legendaries for hours so they wont change until the time is up to prevent cheating
pokemon,not_removed,my guess is that your dss clock is wrong
pokemon,not_removed,you sure youve got the right time
pokemon,not_removed,okay always use bulbapedia or senerbi for pokemon info there the most accurate pokemon websites on the internet heres the links seribi httpwwwserebiinetpokearthhoennnamelesscavernshtml bulbapedia httpbulbapediabulbagardennetwikinamelesscavern
pokemon,not_removed,came here to say the same thing
pokemon,not_removed,edit i cant read
pokemon,not_removed,that site says the same thing did they change spawns recently
pokemon,not_removed,azelf and mesprits times are reversed on igns page
pokemon,not_removed,igns times say that azelf spawns from to and mesprit spawns at to serebiis are the exact opposite azelf spawns from to and mesprit spawns from to while serebiis mesprit spawning period would technically be wrong if you encountered mesprit at i assume you actually encountered it a few minutes before that and recorded the time after you caught it
pokemon,not_removed,its a starter mon all starters have an chance of being male
pokemon,not_removed,braixen or bruxish
pokemon,not_removed,do we really need to still ask this unless the pokemon only evolves when it is a certain gender it doesnt matter what it is
pokemon,not_removed,you mistype primarina
pokemon,not_removed,because theyre starters duh starters have a chance of being guys
pokemon,not_removed,yea i know that my post is more of a complaint than a question
pokemon,not_removed,braixen
pokemon,not_removed,not a question really
pokemon,not_removed,ugh no too fancy for my taste buds
pokemon,not_removed,its because all starters are mostly male and its been like that since gen
pokemon,not_removed,so you asked a question purely because you want to brag about getting a shiny then honestly i dont see the point of this
pokemon,not_removed,but still more femininelooking which seems to be the topic of your post
pokemon,not_removed,gen genders didnt exist in gen with the exception of nidoran line
pokemon,not_removed,i thought i was just sharing my worst good luck of with this community sorry if it felt like i was bragging
pokemon,not_removed,agreed
pokemon,not_removed,because of the way gender was determined in gen though transferring a gen starter would give it a gender which was mostly male so really you can say that it has been this way since gen
pokemon,not_removed,hoping for a proper dolphin in sm maybe some other birds of paradise or perhaps one based on their unofficial state fish httpsenwikipediaorgwikireeftriggerfish
pokemon,not_removed,im from hawaii so its really exciting to see what new pokemon might represent alola it looks like you guys have covered some of the obvious ideas so ill throw out a few that i think would be appropriate to the region i want to see some variations of fairy types i think having a groundfairy pokemon that is based on the menehune the hawaiian equivalent of dwarvesgnomes would fit the region and add a nice variety to the fairy roster also kind of hoping for a bird pokemon based on honeycreepers with multiple formes like vivion a lot of honeycreeper species in hawaii are either extinct or endangered but its kind of iconic feathers of these birds were collected over generations and used to make capes and other royal symbols for the alii chiefs dont know where it would fit but i like the idea of a psychic dragon probably something more hawaii or alola would be a pokemon based on the moo giant waterdwelling shapeshifting lizards that turn to stone when theyre slain theyre the closest thing to dragons that we have there is also a multitude of potential candidates for ghost pokemon ranging from ghost dogs to ghost warriors imagine a fightingghost a proper sea turtle pokemon we have blastoise torterra carracosta and torkoal but most of those dont really fit hawaiialola squirtle is a starter so seeing them in the wild might be kind of weird torterra is a tortoise torkoal might make an appearance but it too is not an aquatic turtle and tirtouga is a fossil pokemon there needs to be a honest to goodness green sea turtle pokemon wana and or opihi sea urchin and cellanalimpetss these sea species are quite iconic to fishing culture in hawaii existing pokemon i hopeexpect there to be in the alola roster the venipede line spinarak nosepass skrelp various cat species pokemon some type of frog pokemon a boat load of water pokemon a plethora of plant pokemon any number of bug pokemon squid and octopus pokemon wailmer what species is wailord based on again
pokemon,not_removed,sea snakes floating sea garbage or diftwood pokemon hydrothermal vents pillow lava underwater magma basalt black rock formed from volcanos poisonous rocks orpidement found near hydrothermal vents or cinnabar found near sulfur deposits and volcanos treasure chest pokemon also real chest could contain items underwater but beware they might attack just a lot of ideas i have had
pokemon,not_removed,a hummingbird pokemon and a mosquito pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,totally unrelated to hawaii but i hope we get a darkfairy oni thing that comes in red and blue variations
pokemon,not_removed,when i saw pokemom i thought kanghaskhan i really didnt think it was a typo until i saw the content anyway yes to dolphins
pokemon,not_removed,more rat and snake pokemon tbh like a ice type snake and grass type ratmouse would be cool
pokemon,not_removed,dolphin whale sea turtle tropical fish tropical birds seals cranes crabs id imagine
pokemon,not_removed,theres almost certainly going to be some kind of gecko pokemon those things are everywhere in hawaii could have some ability based on being able to detach their tails to escape
pokemon,not_removed,there has to be a octopus pokemon with arms and a good ability something like protean
pokemon,not_removed,ive always like the idea of a firegrass hot pepper kid of pokemon if done right
pokemon,not_removed,peacock please flying psychic fairy something of that variety properly it would be a light type but said type is not an official type
pokemon,not_removed,thought i remembered that somewhere
pokemon,not_removed,that is a funky looking fish also i thought we couldnt use sm due to it being porn or something idki havent been keeping up ill use sm from now on
pokemon,not_removed,yes or like the concept of a mosquito but different design
pokemon,not_removed,why dont we have dark fey right now anyway
pokemon,not_removed,you realize there are no snakes in hawaii right on land atleast
pokemon,not_removed,god i didnt even know this existed
pokemon,not_removed,no no sm is sadism and masochism often associated with bondage and domination sm follows the line of all the other games rgby gsc rse etc no one says rebl or blwh when referring to pairs so sumo makes no sense
pokemon,not_removed,just because an animal isnt native to the place the region is based off doesnt mean they cant make a pokemon based off that animal pretty sure dragons dont exist anywhere
pokemon,not_removed,youre welcome
pokemon,not_removed,oh i see xd makes sense lol
pokemon,not_removed,yes and no dragons are fantasy creatures and such tales are found in cultures world wide so while they dont exist physically the concept exists in most parts of the world as for the pokemon based in real life there is definitely a lot of wiggle room however given that we dont have poisonous land snakes we have the poisonous sea snake pelamis platurus and a non poisonous ramphotyphlops braminus or blind snake which would probably be more ground based you would have to say that any other terrestrial snakes are invasive species or would have to exist in a zoosafari zone to keep it in line with the idea of the predominantly isolated island ecosystem that hawaii contains its not that they cant exist in alola just that its far less compelling unless handled properly
pokemon,not_removed,i am not grateful for this
pokemon,not_removed,i mean its pokemon to begin with so its base of reality is already slim to none and i said ice type snake its not like snakes actually enjoy the cold to begin with pokemon in itself is a fantasy anyway so its nice to have these wacky things sometimes perhaps ice serpent wouldve been better wording
pokemon,not_removed,i am
pokemon,not_removed,reply to your tldr lillie is awesome i hated rotom his comic relief was soso but his big ass face taking up most of the bottom screen leaving us with a small map was a poor design decision ride pokemon make me excited for what game freak might do next hms are gone for good i think thats apparent but idk if the ride pokemon concept will work for every region trials are a welcomed change to the formula but i feel like they were lacking something killing a few weak pokemon and then beating a totem pokemon is a bit lame i hope game freak can take the concept and improve on it maybe some zelda type puzzles along with battling enemies
pokemon,not_removed,rotom taking up half the map was a poor design choice would have been easier just to have the whole map fill up i mean its not like we arent aware of rotoms presence already and i do agree on that trial bit id definitely like them to vastly improve on the formula and perhaps add more trials if possible next time around and make them meaningful unless trials happen to be an exclusive alolan type deal kind of like how secret bases are exclusive to hoenn
pokemon,not_removed,looks pretty believable to me pokerus can easily spread once youve obtained it once hidden abilities are easy to breed for once you have them and iv breeding is just a matter of time i have half a box of iv beldum from my masuda method attempt though i must say thats an odd choice of ability nature perhaps they gave it away because it was a breedject from their attempt to find a iv jollynaiveimpish gible it happened to me with minior found three iv and a shiny before getting the right nature ridiculously lucky but still
pokemon,not_removed,id guess no if it were why not just make it a garchomp but if it has some egg moves you made out like a bandit
pokemon,not_removed,im going to say that it isnt hacked why would someone hack a relaxed nature onto a gabite like ew
pokemon,not_removed,not every player who uses editing software is a fool
pokemon,not_removed,debatable but sure nothing screams hacked unlike a shiny still with pokerus
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,i havent checked if sun and moon does this actually but in xyoras if you pat a honedge on the handle with low affection it liked it but if you did the same with high affection it disliked it this is clearly a reference to its dex entry where it steals the souls of people who hold the handle so basically when it loves you its like no plz dont touch the handle but when it doesnt its like mwahahah your soul is mine keeping touching the handle
pokemon,not_removed,pyukumuku the cool peace sign it throws up when you pet it
pokemon,not_removed,i loved how happy latios is when you give him stuff also it was interesting but makes sense that you cant feed shedinja beans at all
pokemon,not_removed,the way eevee prances around after you give him a rainbow bean and the sad face he makes when you pull out a bean and toss it to the side
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,not really gem but i always curious on how do you pat or feed tall pokemon like alolan exeggutor or celesteela did the player fly or have a handy portable stepladder maybe well never know
pokemon,not_removed,i love nebbys highfives the way togedemaru jumps up and down after maxing out a heart is super adorable too
pokemon,not_removed,i think a lot of pokemon do it but when i first opened up refresh wiht my misdreavus she popped her head in upside down from the top giggled at me and floated down rightside up it was pretty adorable
pokemon,not_removed,carbink its an actual gem
pokemon,not_removed,i love guzzlords reaction when you deny him poke beans
pokemon,not_removed,ribombees cute little spin and eye sparkle makes me happy
pokemon,not_removed,its not anything in particular but i love how a lot of pokémon sweet spots make them do the u face cats do when theyre really comfy especially cute on pokémon like torkoal that you wouldnt expect to be so happy looking
pokemon,not_removed,the way alolan ninetails sleeps it uses its tail as a blanket and its just adorable
pokemon,not_removed,early on in my playthrough i accidentally smacked my fletchinder and it flashed its tail up and vibrated its feathers rapidly because of the bright markings on its tail its easy to see how this could be a threat display meant to frighten potential predators a biological accuracy
pokemon,not_removed,mr mime claps when hes happy
pokemon,not_removed,as awful as it makes me as a person some of the angry animations are really cute lurantis and brionnes in particular are adorable
pokemon,not_removed,the hifiving i accidentally did it with my alolan vulpix and my heart melted my favorite to do it with is mimikyu
pokemon,not_removed,it made me laugh the first time i opened refresh and my growlithe poked its head out from the side of the screen with its goofy looking smile
pokemon,not_removed,hydreigon being as excitable as a puppy when you feed and pet it
pokemon,not_removed,kangaskhans baby gets all hyped up even if youre only petting or feeding the mother it basically mimics the movements and expressions of the mother exactly
pokemon,not_removed,ekans eats beans in one bite too but when it swallows you can see a lump travel down its body thats a nice touch
pokemon,not_removed,trying to pet trubbish and seeing what happens to your hand
pokemon,not_removed,whenever i go in and the pokémon are sleeping i melt i love the refresh feature and i hope they bring more features in to interact with your pokémon anything to individualize the value to make them even more special to you
pokemon,not_removed,roserade bowing emolga aurorus and bisharp having parts of them you cant pat just latias emotions in general
pokemon,not_removed,sleeping starters sleeping pikachu line sleeping ninetales such adorableness
pokemon,not_removed,crabrawlers posing and posturing after you pet or feed it is just downright adorable i used to think it was a silly pokemon design but after seeing it in refresh it changed my mind
pokemon,not_removed,mimikyu can highfive you i was truly surprised and happy when i accidentally discovered this
pokemon,not_removed,the place buzzwole likes being pet the most its abs everything about it just makes me love it more lol
pokemon,not_removed,incineroar does not like being pet on the head like a cat would i found that silly and adorable at the same time
pokemon,not_removed,highfiving mimikyu or getting rowlet to headbang for a pokebean
pokemon,not_removed,have you ever tried to piss off a magnemite
pokemon,not_removed,i got a high five from arcanine confirmed for best dog
pokemon,not_removed,rimbombee is so cute in refresh raichu too
pokemon,not_removed,petilil when sleeping
pokemon,not_removed,apparently dratini nuzzles your hand havent tested it out though
pokemon,not_removed,mimikyuu high five
pokemon,not_removed,its always amusing to pet my crabominable only to get my hand frozen
pokemon,not_removed,i love petting and feeding wailord
pokemon,not_removed,the fact that solgaleo likes chin scritches
pokemon,not_removed,my turtwig sleeping my heart melts every time i see that little guy sleep
pokemon,not_removed,what thats awesome
pokemon,not_removed,heart wontstopmelting
pokemon,not_removed,it also tries to boop if you try to highfive it
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt think id get feels coming to a post about pokémon refresh
pokemon,not_removed,thats sadly not a reference but an oversightglitch every pokemon does this for some reason when petting a pokemon for the first time it wont dislike being pet on the area it normally does
pokemon,not_removed,it bugs me that you can feed magnemite haha
pokemon,not_removed,at all how am i gonna raise its affection in seconds without rainbow beans
pokemon,not_removed,you cant feed metapod either
pokemon,not_removed,see this bean throws side ways thats right it wasnt for you
pokemon,not_removed,that is the best one no contest
pokemon,not_removed,ladder
pokemon,not_removed,togekiss is pretty adorable when it pops its head up from the bottom corner like its playing peekaboo
pokemon,not_removed,i never thought a giant monster could be so adorable lol everything it does in refresh is great
pokemon,not_removed,how do you do this i accidentally slapped my pokémon around a little bit at the very beginning looking for interactions that werent petting and it felt really bad
pokemon,not_removed,same with grimer right or is that different
pokemon,not_removed,same with crabominable at first i thought he didnt have claws anymore but rather giant boxingtarget thingys but then on refresh i saw that the purple part was the claw because he snaps them when hes happy
pokemon,not_removed,but my cats love head pats
pokemon,not_removed,sadly its just the waitforfood animation and not actually responding to your movement
pokemon,not_removed,oh really ah well works for me
pokemon,not_removed,you have to max out nincada its affection gets passed down to both evolutions
pokemon,not_removed,happy birthday to the ground
pokemon,not_removed,whats the difference they do the same thing right i think you should stick with the basic facts of the matter
pokemon,not_removed,if they used a ladder theyd have to lean it against the pokemon a stepladder would be self supporting and would cause less discomfort to the pokemon and be more stable but then again i do need to stop judging things based off narrowminded cultural assumptions
pokemon,not_removed,raceattorney is leaking
pokemon,not_removed,hold the stylus on the screen for about five seconds make sure the pokémon is looking at the hand icon make sure its a pokémon that will high five like rock ruff or something
pokemon,not_removed,i know right rubbing their heads are like crack for cats sometimes they like it sometimes they go on violent rampage
pokemon,not_removed,no wtf mine did it too when i was trying to highfive it
pokemon,not_removed,i threw the rest of the cake too
pokemon,not_removed,ah ok thanks
pokemon,not_removed,shiny wishiwashi
pokemon,not_removed,haha drove past this the other night respect
pokemon,not_removed,no all starters will only have overgrowblazetorrent as their final primary ability and rowlet was already revealed to be grassflying i sincerely doubt theyd change a starters secondary typing once it has one
pokemon,not_removed,honestly i feel rowlet is definitely gonna stay grassflying since this is the first time in six generations where we finally got a new dual typed starter but if it would change its typing it will most likely become grassfighting to emphasize on the kicking attributes the pokedex specifies it has and can we stop with the waterfighting thing for popplio every site manager ive seen has said that the order of those typing doesnt matter they could go to either one of them maybe none of them the fighting possibly going to iwanko and becoming rockfighting while ground could go to grubbins first evolution becoming bugground and then finally bugelectric
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think so because the six generation precedent of starters having overgrow as their ability wont be overruled besides i thought we were all speculating grassground based on website data plus not even hoothoot nor noctowl are psychic
pokemon,not_removed,no its going to stay part flying also the website fireground not dark
pokemon,not_removed,fam rowlets typing was confirmed as waterflying
pokemon,not_removed,for the alola trio website data hint at possible waterfight and firedark typings no it doesnt the website data hints at grassground pure fire and waterfighting
pokemon,not_removed,what website data are you looking at to get fire dark fire rock is more likely to fit into a waterfighting and grass flying trio
pokemon,not_removed,cant believe i forgot about overgrow it may be less likely but its still possible they might change the secondary type though i do admit its mostly wishful thinking on my part
pokemon,not_removed,id really like to see it lose flying as a secondary type but i must agree that it seems likely that itll keep it
pokemon,not_removed,tbh id rather they dont give us any fighting type starter for at least two generations
pokemon,not_removed,the order of those types dont matter and whos to say those two types dont belong to other pokemon like fighting for iwanko rockfighting and ground for grubbins first evo stage bugground
pokemon,not_removed,sorry my bad for not double checking the info
pokemon,not_removed,youre not the only one either
pokemon,not_removed,those pokémon werent even announced back then and it doesnt even matter if the order matters or not what op said about the data showing a dark type was still wrong i merely pointed out the correct types from the website and the order they were shown in
pokemon,not_removed,ah true true still would love if litten turned firedark
pokemon,not_removed,thats also what im hoping for it would suck to get another firefighting starter and a fireground cat would be really weird
pokemon,not_removed,anything better then firerock really i know that people say it would complete a super effectiveness triangle but seriously ●that was something only gen did and doesnt mean every gen from now on has to do that as well ●that typing would ensure littens place in pu at worst nuru at beast
pokemon,not_removed,since iwanko seems to be connected to the starters i doubt any of them will share their typing with it
pokemon,not_removed,exactly
pokemon,not_removed,i fought against a mega beedril and a mega swampert in a battle royal im assuming theyll be added one bank gets here
pokemon,not_removed,no youre not
pokemon,not_removed,the ones you cant presently get are the ones for pokemon you cant presently acquire anyway
pokemon,not_removed,theyll most likely be available next game lol xy didnt have all the megas and had version exclusives but oras has all no version exclusives
pokemon,not_removed,i know im really hoping that with the update for pokebank there will be one to be able to obtain the rest
pokemon,not_removed,im hoping the pokebank update might allow pokemon to hold items if its mega stones or z crystals so that we dont always have to hunt them down
pokemon,not_removed,hehe widowmaker
pokemon,not_removed,ryokos in sf also has a pokemon roll that was delicious
pokemon,not_removed,saw that and thought this was roverwatch
pokemon,not_removed,bet that widowmaker is amazing
pokemon,not_removed,whats the white stuff on that one finger
pokemon,not_removed,beauty and pokemon a perfect combination of my interests well done
pokemon,not_removed,wow i love the holo and the accent nail it is perfect
pokemon,not_removed,plottwist you are a guy d
pokemon,not_removed,so pretty ywy
pokemon,not_removed,really good job
pokemon,not_removed,great work looks fab
pokemon,not_removed,i love the colours i always get annoyed with long nails gets in the way of touch screens etc so im amazed at ppl with nice long nails
pokemon,not_removed,i believe its intended to be half moon half sun
pokemon,not_removed,i live for nail polish and pokemon couldnt live without it
pokemon,not_removed,thank you d
pokemon,not_removed,it really is super annoying but you kinda get used to it i do have a bit shorter nails on my other hand and it is much easier to use that one for writing on both keyboard and phone
pokemon,not_removed,ah i get now haha
pokemon,not_removed,completely your fault man
pokemon,not_removed,the cutscene is pretty long but unless you saw the text box say now saving do not turn off the power like in every other instance you save then you did not save you will have to go through the credits again most likely
pokemon,not_removed,yes unless it tells you it saved assume it didnt save you have to watch those cutscenes and do the post champion fight again
pokemon,not_removed,this has happened to other people it doesnt in this as were the others yes you do have to watch through all of it and also dont freak out about the pokemon battle its fresh to catch after the cutscenes
pokemon,not_removed,if the game doesent say savingbon the screen dont assume it did save being sble to skip credits may have been possible in previous games but in sun and moon you cant
pokemon,not_removed,pokemondbnet has a searhable pokedex that lists where every pokemon can be caught in each version you can also search the areas of each game ie route and see what pokemon are available on it including how likely they are to appear that is what i use it requires some manual effort but i do not know of anything easier
pokemon,not_removed,look to the left youll see each gens pokedex hope that helps
pokemon,not_removed,you probably wont be able to complete the gen pokedex by yourself and the gen pokedex pretty much requires you to have every game besides platinumtheres at least exclusive in each game besides platinum gen is mostly easy if you could do gen pokedex but again youd need black and white or a mix of black or white and then white or black you can catch nearly every pokemon in the gen games since trading is worldwide and currently in use its way easy
pokemon,not_removed,rpokemontrades the gts and getting rare breed ables like bank balls in xy and oras helps immensely
pokemon,not_removed,get a ha mareanie and you can trade for most anything
pokemon,not_removed,thanks
pokemon,not_removed,will do
pokemon,not_removed,ahh the first ever fire dark type i love it
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know if i have to give credit to myself or not but just for the rules sake heres the original art
pokemon,not_removed,i always liked phoebes character amazing in both design and personally a cheerful girl who can commune with the undead who despite specializing in a type thats more on the darker side is bursting with energy and life so glad they brought her back for the remakes
pokemon,not_removed,wow such nostalgia
pokemon,not_removed,as a kid i always wanted to experience those cool legendary distrubtion events i was too poor and too out of the loop to actually get them most times when i learned about these cartridges i immediately started to scout for them this is the first one i picked up
pokemon,not_removed,absorption httpwwwpokemonsunmooncomenusultrabeasts
pokemon,not_removed,thats a mosquito
pokemon,not_removed,im really curious to know exactly what its going to be about
pokemon,not_removed,itll be the logan of pokemon movies
pokemon,not_removed,you want rpokemontades
pokemon,not_removed,xy lots of different pokemon on each route creates a different experience each time
pokemon,not_removed,think it depends on the person i personally enjoyed leafgreenfirered and an emerald randomizer
pokemon,not_removed,i enjoy gen until i get to fight against the dragon type aka nuzlocke slayer
pokemon,not_removed,im doing a heartgold wedlocke right now and the grinding is brutal with arguably the hardest gym leaders in the series this game can be a nightmare and the trainers are pretty hard too a level raichu with thunderbolt after the gym
pokemon,not_removed,dark rising in all seriousness though lots of variety especially early on slightly challenging and also pretty fun
pokemon,not_removed,i havent done any nuzlockes but i feel like any of the second gen games would offer a great experience simply because of how long the games are after surviving the johto league you have to run through a revamped kanto league and then face off against red so much potential for death
pokemon,not_removed,i in someways dissagree due to the amount of grinding that you have to do in the gen games however if you can get past that then you will have a great time due to the amount of content in the game
pokemon,not_removed,thats mainly why i put it forward probably the updated versions would be the better choice it would be super long and your team at the end would be real champions haha
pokemon,not_removed,amount of grinding that you have to do in the gen games in ss when you first get to kanto the ocean pokemon are level the gym leaders and trainers are in the and pokemon in grass are level annoys me so much
pokemon,not_removed,please format no one wants to read walls of text we cant pick an age because that fucks up the story completely simple as that the partner thing is kinda weird for a childrens game and really out of place also doesnt make much sense and is basically opowers but you cant use them yourself
pokemon,not_removed,changing age will never be a thing because there will no longer be a default character ie red leaf brendan may calem serena etc i think the thing people dont seem to realize about the pokémon games is that you arent creating your own characteryoure simply controlling one that has already been created for you much like how you control link in zelda no matter how much you customize the protagonist in x its still just calem no matter what you name the protagonist in diamond its still just lucas its their stories not so much your own the point im trying to make with this is that changing the age of the character would mean that youre basically creating a character from scratch and while this might be good from a player standpoint it goes against what pokémon has been about from the very beginning and the lack of a default character would cause storytelling problems down the road
pokemon,not_removed,why dont these childrens games cater to adults
pokemon,not_removed,a forty year old beating up a youngsters top percentage rattata would look like kind of a dick
pokemon,not_removed,partner friend same as getting someones trainer number and all so it would basically be getting more use out of the trainers number open your mind some im not for sure on how it would eff up the story but every game has had a different story so honestly it wouldnt mess up anything if you think its messed up why isnt the main trainer you named ash on every single pokemon game why isnt pikachu the starter pokemon of every game since it was ashs first pokemon its not just a childrens game there are plenty of people that have been playing this game since the very first pokemon game came out
pokemon,not_removed,i mean the story is messed up because lillie shouldnt be adventuring with a year old man i dont know why you brought up ash seeing as the games came first and are in a completely different universe from the anime and yes pokemon is still a game aimed primarily at children just because older people play it doesnt change that fact
pokemon,not_removed,well if they can change the gender depending on whichever you chose then it shouldnt be hard to change the age of the ai i say ash because thats who was there when it first started and i was going along with the whole story situation being messed up but you clarified it for me on what you meant so if you want to just ignore that then the age thing isnt such a bigger i was gearing more towards having more options to choose from when getting to customize your trainer all opinions is all
pokemon,not_removed,i would have to disagree with you on that last bit just because its childfriendly doesnt mean its aimed at kids sun and moon is filled to the brim with things kids just wouldnt be able to understand from the memes to the innuendos to the woman talking about her dead husband to kiawe being let go from his job gamefreak is not stupid they know who their audience now or at least the localization team does
pokemon,not_removed,kids most definitely understand memos people dying and people being let off they arent stupid disney movies have innuendos does that mean they arent for children
pokemon,not_removed,like i just said just because they understand which youre wrong aboutthey dont understand it on the level teenagers and young adults do doesnt mean the game is aimed towards them and i would even venture to say that recent disney movies arent entirely for kids either frozen big hero zootopiathey all have really heavy themes that though kids can understand on the surface they dont really comprehend the scope or impact of them id like to hear your side what makes you think that the game is for kids i could understand that argument with xy but with sm not so much
pokemon,not_removed,you cant just say youre wrong thats not an argument even so yes kids do understand the impact of the death of a spouse sun and moon are definitely childrens games because the games themselves are rated e you play as a preteen and all the marketing features kids they even made a plastic toy that only a kid would want to go with the game look its fine to enjoy a kids game we all do but dont be so insecure and say well it has some dark stuff so its basically gta because its not they mightve played up the nostalgia but this game is still first and foremost marketed towards children
pokemon,not_removed,well it has some dark stuff so its basically gta lmao ok dude you either didnt pay attention to the game or you didnt play it and i said you were wrong because its a fact that you are wrong not because my personal opinion says otherwise oh and by the way e stands for everyone not infants not toddlers not children everyone edit i also would like to point out that you have a flawed concept of what makes a game mature just because a game is for teens doesnt mean it has to violent and inappropriate like gta smfh
pokemon,not_removed,yes i know what e means they specifically didnt put anything in the game that would put it past e because then their main audience children wouldnt be able to buy it like i said you cant just say im wrong because you said so show me proof just because this game has morbid pokedex entries doesnt mean its for adults edit how do i have a flawed concept of what makes a game mature i was just using gta as an example also yes a t game does need some level of violence or inappropriateness that would bump it out of range
pokemon,not_removed,super smash bros tm melee for the nintendo gamecube tm released in
pokemon,not_removed,yes yes it is
pokemon,not_removed,i absolutely love your style keep them coming
pokemon,not_removed,pretty not sure why there arent more upvotesdo jirachi pls haha
pokemon,not_removed,this is so good please keep up the great work
pokemon,not_removed,this would be a great design for a tattoo just saying maybe a plausible line of work
pokemon,not_removed,bruh these are really cool i hope you keep drawing and posting these theyre great tattoo ideas could i request slowpoke and gengar
pokemon,not_removed,super cool i think itd look even better if youd try to do the pokemon in dotwork style as well altho thats pretty difficult haha
pokemon,not_removed,awesome really like your use of stippling
pokemon,not_removed,nice where can i find more
pokemon,not_removed,this is soooo awesome this is worthy of being a tattoo
pokemon,not_removed,thank a lot man i will indeed keep them coming man
pokemon,not_removed,thanx a lot and ummm i post all my art on my ig zerojtx if you would like to check it out thanx a lot
pokemon,not_removed,thanx a lot
pokemon,not_removed,followed
pokemon,not_removed,this art is created by httpstwittercomahruon it mustve taken a ton of time note there is a version of this from way back but it didnt include the dlc characters such as mewtwo yet
pokemon,not_removed,all pokémon no ivysaur and squirtle
pokemon,not_removed,at what point is something no longer pixel art and simply digital art
pokemon,not_removed,dat zss belly button doe
pokemon,not_removed,im in love with his work
pokemon,not_removed,why is mr gw in
pokemon,not_removed,wii u version probably not brawl
pokemon,not_removed,rowlet learns dragon ascent confirmed
pokemon,not_removed,simple geometry in that rowlet is a perfect sphere
pokemon,not_removed,grass flying would be a cool typing same with grass dragon as it would be the only pokemon besides mega sceptile to be that typing
pokemon,not_removed,and alolan exeggutor
pokemon,not_removed,theres never those kinds of move tutors in the first games of a gen for some reason
pokemon,not_removed,well most likely get move tutors next game just gotta wait
pokemon,not_removed,ah thats so weird alrighty then
pokemon,not_removed,yeah im just kind of waiting for pokebank to come out now for some things i suppose
pokemon,not_removed,why not the other way round clover is meant to be the rare one
pokemon,not_removed,thats not how shiny pokemon work
pokemon,not_removed,this is awesome did you paint this the stones holding it down are a nice touch ♥
pokemon,not_removed,does the artist have a tumblr or deviantart
pokemon,not_removed,i did its watercolor
pokemon,not_removed,its mine i only have an instagram
pokemon,not_removed,well if your open with sharing that id love to have a link
pokemon,not_removed,i have plans to tackle a vulpix today
pokemon,not_removed,there are a lot of types that have nothing immune to it the question is what type avoids the most not very effective remarks
pokemon,not_removed,dazzling gleam is a decent option its a tm so easy to teach id recommend a high level kadabra or gardevoir with synchronize so you can also try for a decent nature and the hordes should be low leveled enough to ohko even if its resisted but nothing is immune to fairy type
pokemon,not_removed,i just use surf nothing that you find in any horde ive used for training can survive a strong one and its super effective on just about everything youll run into with sturdy too
pokemon,not_removed,or maybe just a type no pokemon horde encounter in oras none of them is immune to
pokemon,not_removed,blizzard
pokemon,not_removed,okay i might use it
pokemon,not_removed,this
pokemon,not_removed,maybe only counting the encounter
pokemon,not_removed,yes it is as well as forced incest robbing and whatnot and a relevant quote from david mitchell in his nazi sketch are we the baddies
pokemon,not_removed,thus brings about the question do the costs outweigh the benefits yes we are taking advantage of these poor creatures but were also saving the world soooo
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,litten
pokemon,not_removed,i would if you havent already try forcequitting the app and restarting your phone once your phone is back up try reloading the app that should allow you to start from a fresh state and give you the opportunity to log in again if that doesnt work try uninstalling the app and reinstalling it then try opening it again if that still doesnt work sacrifice a gogoat in a ritual to arceus to restore your account
pokemon,not_removed,pikachu might get tired by the furfrou guy so he might not use pikachu for his first fight i think theyre really gonna make the ash vs sawyer battle intense both the animation and the direction but of course the best battle will be the finals when ashs greninja is up against alains mega charizard x
pokemon,not_removed,its been said multiple times but this is his best chance to take a championship excellent writing so far leads me to believe that they wont drop the ball at the end of the day
pokemon,not_removed,hype vids
pokemon,not_removed,considering that ash will be fighting at least battles hell probably use some of his older pokemon remember sinnoh after fighting paul ash switched of his team because they wered tired as hell and the only one that he used vs both tobias and paul was pikachu i just cant see a way how his current pokemonthe that he has currently goodra will be able to fight battles in a row i know that in the first battleprobably against that furfrou trainer he wont use all because the first rounds are usually or iirc
pokemon,not_removed,watch tobias come back and win this league too
pokemon,not_removed,hes going to lose thats one of the animes rules
pokemon,not_removed,goodra pls come back
pokemon,not_removed,i cant wait to find out what that massive orange shuriken is
pokemon,not_removed,does it air or in japan time
pokemon,not_removed,im looking forward to it but im more looking forward to seeing what ashs pokémon will be in the ash vs sawyer parter
pokemon,not_removed,should be pretty exciting first time that ash gets all the way to the finals hopefully his battle with alan will live up to expectations
pokemon,not_removed,anyone just want see ash get in there super cocky and absolutely shrek shit i want alain to be like ah hell nah this honkey got a sick ass ninja throwin yellow shit and ash is like science is so amazing and then clemont is like all yall bitches post up to science and then steals all da ladies even brocks serena and bonnie are there too
pokemon,not_removed,i hope they dont make a full chapter with the inscriptionopen ceremony as they usually do and im looking forward see the mega charizard battle too
pokemon,not_removed,im excited to see the battle between shota and ash its going to be one of the best battles of the entire series
pokemon,not_removed,im most excited to see alains other pokemon last time we saw him all we say was charizard and metang given that this is the league it will be interesting to see what he has my theory is that all his pokemon will have the capability of mega evolving since he was in the mega evolution specials
pokemon,not_removed,on what site is it available tomorrow
pokemon,not_removed,dumb question but whats the best way to watch pokemon i have no cable
pokemon,not_removed,hope he wins
pokemon,not_removed,yeah im hyped for more laser attacks in the anime
pokemon,not_removed,does anyone know where i can find a list of only the important episodes of xy id like to get caught up but all the filler episodes make it an unappealing prospect
pokemon,not_removed,dumb question but where are you watching these episodes the latest english sub that i can find is the one where ash went into the forest before he gets the badge
pokemon,not_removed,l e t s g o a s h
pokemon,not_removed,how big is the chance we actually get to see ashs older pokemon like he did in the sinnoh league i want
pokemon,not_removed,not here in america saturday is the conclusion to serenas master class
pokemon,not_removed,is it too much hoped that the y charizard will be ashs and not that shota trevor dudes
pokemon,not_removed,i hope he will lost
pokemon,not_removed,yes but im actually really excited to see the rest of alains team unless they pull a tobias and only show him with mega charizard x which is cool but i dont only want mega battles i also want awesome battles with all sorts of pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,excellent writing i mean its better than what we got in previous gens but going as far as excellent is overstatement at its finest crap thats less stinky is still crap
pokemon,not_removed,his team just really disappoints me two dragons flying types ninjaswarriorsfighters i miss when he had a diverse cast like in sinnoh or even unova even tho unova was all over the place
pokemon,not_removed,actually i disagree ash kalos team is by far the most non diverse team he has ever had he is doomed if he faces another team with strong electric typ pokemons literally all of his pokemons are weak to that except for pikachu he is so lucky that paul isnt in the kalos league
pokemon,not_removed,spoiler alert for when the anime goes into gen ash will lose the league in alola
pokemon,not_removed,well technically since team flares plot is likely going to start during the finals ash and alain who are likely in the finals and well the league will be cancelled than when the plot ends with a couple episodes before sun and moon ash will defeat alain in a rematch in a field somewhere to prove that he is the rightful champion its just he doesnt officially win it bam it writes itself ashs league match gets cancelled but he beats his final rival in the end to prove he can be champion than he can head to the islands where pikachu gets its assed kicked by a newly hatched litten or whatever
pokemon,not_removed,pm jst
pokemon,not_removed,lmfao
pokemon,not_removed,i believe that his other will probably be really weak and charizardmetagross will wipe ashs team and the hero we call ashfucking greninja comes to save the day
pokemon,not_removed,i usually wait for it to be on youtube but im sure there are other sites
pokemon,not_removed,youtube is probably the best source but itll obviously be raw japanese so if you want to understand what theyre saying youll need to hope someone translates it quickly but it usually takes a few days other streaming sites have better quality but arent as fast to update compared to people who post on youtube
pokemon,not_removed,if you undertand spanish there a lots of sites that will have the episode tomorrow
pokemon,not_removed,hes met a bunch of them already hes been travelling with two fairy types for quite some time and hes come across pretty much all of them
pokemon,not_removed,pirate bro
pokemon,not_removed,netflix has all of season up through episode of indigo league plus first seasons of xy hulu paid has seasons through pokemoncom rotates available episodes with frustrating lack of clarity but you can find a whole bunch over there whether theyre what youre looking for is another story you can also find a lot of them hosted all over the place online but they are often really slow to load poor quality or full of garbage ads however if you can muscle through googling the specific episode title or seasonepisode number will usually yield a result
pokemon,not_removed,netflix torrent sreaming sites
pokemon,not_removed,cartooncrazyme
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,if you want to watch it live from japan just search for tv tokyo live stream and youll find websites calculate when it will air in your local time then enjoyassuming you have a fast internet unlike mine after a few hours of airing in japan you can find raw version on youtube and some other websites like gogoanime after a few days speedsubs will be up on youtube by some individuals they have got errors in spelling grammar or sentence structure but obviously better than watching raw japanese if you dont know japanese at all the subs from pocket monsters sub group will be up after a few weeks these are the ones you were watching
pokemon,not_removed,its going to be pretty rare for him to bring back one of his other pokemon its most likely going to be goodra for his but we just have to wait and see
pokemon,not_removed,well i mean the charizard x v y battle will be happening in like the first round and ash is already confirmed to make at least the semi finals so
pokemon,not_removed,its been confirmed its trevors
pokemon,not_removed,eh he has naurto the pokemon thats as anime as it can get
pokemon,not_removed,personally i hope he will won
pokemon,not_removed,ok
pokemon,not_removed,ashs current team is pretty good compared to best wishesfreakin unevolved pokemon so it would be cool to see him up against alains equally good team although since theyve only shown him plowing through everyone with just mega charizard x i would assume he doesnt have as good a connection with his other pokemon like ash does so ash could potentially beat his other pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,we know he has a metang too would be surprised if he didnt have at least
pokemon,not_removed,youre right excellent by comparison
pokemon,not_removed,excellent as far as pokemon anime goes
pokemon,not_removed,i think it has more to do with the lack of new pokemon along with not repeating pokemon between ash and other trainers i mean based on his past roster and ashs personality the only other pokes that would have made sense was gogoat pyroar barbacle dragalge and vivillion and out of these also have a type already reflected in ashs current roster
pokemon,not_removed,hell do that thing again where he swaps out for older ones like he usually does
pokemon,not_removed,gasp reported for spoilers without tags s
pokemon,not_removed,than he can head to the islands where pikachu gets its assed kicked by a newly hatched litten or whatever lold
pokemon,not_removed,no ash will be beaten by some jackass introduced in the episode where ash loses and alain will never be mentioned again
pokemon,not_removed,but mega charizard xs fire is blue
pokemon,not_removed,that doesnt really explain why the red thing on greninjas head is glowing though the glow suggest more of something like a different formtriggering an ability
pokemon,not_removed,will it be on crunchy roll
pokemon,not_removed,thank you very much
pokemon,not_removed,where do you guys watch it on or follow it btw
pokemon,not_removed,i cringe every time when i see his snivy oshawott and pignite well at least his tepig evolved when he did it with bulbasaur and squirtle it was special but there they were just trying to recreate it and it didnt really work imo
pokemon,not_removed,it was showed as a metagross in a recent scan
pokemon,not_removed,ya i was surprised when i saw metang because its been so long since actually seen alain with a pokemon other than charizard
pokemon,not_removed,absolutely crap thats less stinky is still crap
pokemon,not_removed,episode
pokemon,not_removed,i found that sums it up very nicely the only part it leaves out is the difference between the dubbed and subbed versions the dub changes or just cuts out some music which can really ruin a scene some of my favourite scenes in the sub fell flat in the dub because of this other than that its personal preference on voice actors also you may have trouble finding them all subbed before xy as for where to start its up to you i personally quite liked sinnoh the region after may so that might be worth watching you could watch them all but it would take a while the earlier ones in particular get really repetitive especially if youre binge watching them but there are some good ones spread throughout the earlier films are definitely worth watching and the later ones are still okay but i didnt enjoy them as much unova was my least favourite and its where all the ash forgets everything hes always etc things come from theres no mention of any of that stuff in xy so feel free to skip it
pokemon,not_removed,its the best the show has been imo the xy group is great ash is shown to be more compotent and mature the battles are exciting and theres a lot of build up right now with ashgreninja zygarde and team flare if you want to jump straight into whats going on right now then start with the first xyz episode i recconend watching the xy series first though because some characters are introduced there and theres plenty of good episodes that would otherwise be missed out on
pokemon,not_removed,this may have been the only reigon where ash didnt have a grass type
pokemon,not_removed,i wouldve loved it if he got an amaura his last ice type was glalie and it was a real powerhouse i would love it if he got an another ice type
pokemon,not_removed,he only did this for johto and sinnoh though didnt he
pokemon,not_removed,this i really hope they dont write him to be dumb enough to use flyingtypes in his team i would really love to see charizard infernape and sceptile among others to return
pokemon,not_removed,no crunchyroll notably does not have any official pokemon content
pokemon,not_removed,i watch mine on gogoanime even the raw versions when they come out then i watch the newer one on youtube because couple people sub them the next day
pokemon,not_removed,yeah the unevolved pokemon in the kanto series made sense because he was still inexperienced as a trainer but they did it again in best wishes and made him look like a year old no wonder iris called him a kid glad they changed the writers this time and made ash mature again
pokemon,not_removed,i really wouldnt call this season crap lmao
pokemon,not_removed,smell ya later
pokemon,not_removed,it is only one where he didnt get the grass starter either bulbasaur bayleef sceptile torterra snivy
pokemon,not_removed,dumb enough to use three flying types charizard really
pokemon,not_removed,yeah normally its a duller red
pokemon,not_removed,oh okay thank you
pokemon,not_removed,arent the newer ones on gogoanime not subbed
pokemon,not_removed,just as a detail most of the writers are actually still the same as the past series what really changed is the director and it shows incidentally best wishes director was also new to the series and he probably wanted to recapture the feel of the original series without understanding what made it work honestly while i actually like some of ashs unova mons most of them were barely characters like palpitoad and i actually prefer how all of ashs kalos team got good personality plus it has some good choices my only complaint being the fact it has three flying types and if the predictions are real and goodra is coming back then that might be lessened
pokemon,not_removed,its still the same old show as its always been just with slightly more multi arcs it hasnt departed from the same old repetitive crap that made it stagnant edit you know its true those of you who disagree are in denial
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think you got my point i dont want charizard to be his pokemon i want him to scramble his team and make it diverse and listed charizard as a possible addition to this scrambled team why would i want charizard to be his and make him have flyingtypes lol
pokemon,not_removed,sub comes out tomorrow i watch the raw on there then i wait the next day for the sub version on youtube
pokemon,not_removed,do girls really fall for this pokesexual innuendo
pokemon,not_removed,that was onixpected
pokemon,not_removed,i would just feel really oddish saying something like that
pokemon,not_removed,i might have to raichu up for that
pokemon,not_removed,it wont show up in your box when on the isle im pretty sure i havent messed with it much yet but i am pretty sure that when putting pokemon onto isle evelup it has you move them from the pc into the special group thing i think after trainingremoving them from training should have you move them back to the pc someone else will probably answer this better since i havent done it much and it is late for me but wanted to give you some kind of quick answer
pokemon,not_removed,click the sign
pokemon,not_removed,this is correct in my experience i was going to go evolve my charjabug and i couldnt find it in any of my boxes and i forgot i put it in isle evelup to gain experience by hitting the sign as mentioned above you can call back the pokemon you put into the island for training and theyll be back in your pc
pokemon,not_removed,looking at your photos makes me hungry photo of a corsola toxapex confirmed
pokemon,not_removed,for anyone left out op is referring to the too much water comment which is a now infamous negative point listed on an ign review of alpha sapphire httpknowyourmemecommemestoomuchwater
pokemon,not_removed,on the internet nobody knows youre a toxapex
pokemon,not_removed,yes
pokemon,not_removed,that fucking popplio xd its prime meme material other than that great job
pokemon,not_removed,yeah hes a pretty derpy one ive made a butterfree and an altaria since this picture theyre great d
pokemon,not_removed,i had a vocab question on my sat related to the definition of protean crazy how these games can actually help in real life eh
pokemon,not_removed,oh etymology
pokemon,not_removed,i had the exact same thing when i was in school with the word ursa thanks to ursaring
pokemon,not_removed,thats so cool thatll never happen to me though
pokemon,not_removed,i thought this would be about celebi or dialga
pokemon,not_removed,piloswine helped my friend figure out that pilo had something to do with hair because its furry of course i learned a lot of color words from the first gen
pokemon,not_removed,one time i was in biology class and the teacher saw me talking a bit too loud with another classmate trying to make me look bad he asked me about cholophyll which was the topic of the class i imediately remembered about the pokemon ability and that it had something to do with the sunny day and somehow managed to answer correctly after that i proceeded to keep talking on a more hushed tone for the rest of the class
pokemon,not_removed,reminds me of how runescape taught me how bronze is made
pokemon,not_removed,ahh the glory of puns
pokemon,not_removed,something similar happened to me on a standardized test about grade i was asked to define the word regicide and seeing the regi my mind immediately went to regigigas then i remembered that he was the leader or king if you will of the regi trio so thats how i taught myself that regicide meant the murder of a king
pokemon,not_removed,i got into my dream school and just recently graduated all thanks to vulpix partly thanks to vulpix lets not exaggerate it wasnt a game changer although its pretty cool that pokemon helped ya on your sat ive enriched my english vocabulary a lot thanks to pokemon and its a big reason why i wanted to learn english in the first place not my mother tongue
pokemon,not_removed,this was me with the moves facade and embargo
pokemon,not_removed,this happened to me on a biology test in high school there was a question about the kind of relationships pokemon have together and the answer was about manta rays and remoras which i could so easily remember because of mantine and remoraid
pokemon,not_removed,haha yeah pokemon has helped me with many tests in the past feels awesome
pokemon,not_removed,i had that one too needless to say i aced that question
pokemon,not_removed,haha thats awesome
pokemon,not_removed,please elaborate i dont understand fully
pokemon,not_removed,for me its ursoc in wow but yeah games help a ton
pokemon,not_removed,same but mainly because i am already in college and took the act xx
pokemon,not_removed,yeah depending on how you interpret the title at first glance i thought the same thing
pokemon,not_removed,the colours actually confused me because cinnabar and vermilion are the same thing
pokemon,not_removed,and how steel is iron with extra carbon which is why its ironcoal in runescape
pokemon,not_removed,the gory of puns ftfy because you butchered it theyre more portmanteaus than they are puns
pokemon,not_removed,it was obviously an exaggeration b no need to point it out
pokemon,not_removed,i know what facade means but i dont know how that relates to being under a status like you lure someone into a false sense of security with a weak front
pokemon,not_removed,yeah aerial aced it
pokemon,not_removed,protean means able to change quicklyfrequently protean the pokemon ability makes your type change quickly and frequently
pokemon,not_removed,wow is great for learning mythology cenarius is cernunnos is xerneas
pokemon,not_removed,gre vocab
pokemon,not_removed,haha nah i sucked at that game i never got that far
pokemon,not_removed,idk i felt the need to i didnt mean to be a douche
pokemon,not_removed,it is hard to understand but i think the move effect means that the user is actually weak from the status condition but hit harder and deal more damage to put up a facade that it is strong
pokemon,not_removed,greninja changed to the flying type
pokemon,not_removed,oh ok im not very educated in the abilities part of it thanks for clearing it up
pokemon,not_removed,id like to think me acing the vocab section was in part due to my splurging of various translated manga including pokemon cant hurt
pokemon,not_removed,honestly i didnt feel like you were being a douche youre just pointing out that he shouldnt sell himself short on his other skills needed to pass the sat downvotes are a bit unjustified imo
pokemon,not_removed,aw
pokemon,not_removed,you werent being a douche at all and you arent wrong people on this subreddit are just a bit upset you broke their narrative
pokemon,not_removed,i wish dedenne learned moonblast or something to give it fairy stab on a move that goes with its highish special attack stat
pokemon,not_removed,ledian having that special defense protruding past all its other nonexistent to mediocre stats causes me to see some red
pokemon,not_removed,zebstrika gets so many great special attacks thunderbolt overheat volt switch etc but has only base spa compared to a solid base atk the problem with this is that it gets literally no good physical moves well i guess im wrong you do actually get good physical move to run a physicalattacking set the only good move that you get is wild charge otherwise you can only run stuff like facade pursuit and quick attack pretty sad itd be really cool if he got a mega and gained access to better physical moves horn leech and earthquake come to mind
pokemon,not_removed,id like to know why onix has the same attack stat as butterfree
pokemon,not_removed,not necessarily concerns movepools but dex entries say escavalier flies at high speeds is one of the slowest pokemon ever
pokemon,not_removed,flareon is famous for how troubling its movepool is compared to its attackstat things have gotten better over time but i still find it lacking
pokemon,not_removed,gourgeist its special movepool is amazing learning moves like flamethrower and fire blast and yet they gave it such a pitiful special attack and also typhlosion its stat and movepool are really contradicting one with each other
pokemon,not_removed,more recently solrocks low spa confuses me because it learns a lot of special attacks but not many physicalnonrock attacks
pokemon,not_removed,typhlosion has the same problem a superbroad physical movepool but stats strongly geared for specialattacking theres also maractus who i seem to bring up in pretty much every thread like this it has excellent spatk but literally every special move it learns is either normal or grasstype it has a huge variety of physical moves too just to add further insult
pokemon,not_removed,ive never been a fan of stats that are high on hp and lower on defense i would love to tweak wailord and emboar a bit it would be nice if all the pikaclones had higher stat totals like raichu since they dont evolve
pokemon,not_removed,pyroar was a huge letdown id love to run a moxie set but its stats are geared towards being a special attacker
pokemon,not_removed,same as op im really mad at sceptile looking at the movepool i wish his attack was higher in my opinion he even look like a a physical attacker and not a special attacker
pokemon,not_removed,watchog there is literally nothing redeeming about it all the other normal rodents have some unique quality but watchog has no reason to exist
pokemon,not_removed,electivire has the highest base attack stat of all nonlegendary electric types but it doesnt have the bulk or the speed to use it effectively in competitive
pokemon,not_removed,dustox i want to see the moth have a much higher special attack mightyena should have at least attack to make it more useable with better defence at least give it an evolution
pokemon,not_removed,anything with a weirdly numbered stat like leavannys base attack is why not or why so odd with pseudo legendaries i can almost understand since theyve got a total to stick with but other than that
pokemon,not_removed,alomomola having special attack and attack has always been strange to me it should be reversed in my opinion
pokemon,not_removed,i agree
pokemon,not_removed,what makes me the most annoyed is that it gets so many great punch moves that it could make use of with its ability iron fist but with base attack thats pretty hard to do
pokemon,not_removed,oddish has a higher attack stat than onix
pokemon,not_removed,its also odd that its the cavalry pokemon why not go with knight or lancer or something
pokemon,not_removed,the fact that a non stab return is often seen on flareon basically says it all
pokemon,not_removed,not the movepool that sucks he just needs rockhead ability
pokemon,not_removed,emboars high hp makes it great at flare blitz spam
pokemon,not_removed,yes i still dont understand this
pokemon,not_removed,i mean an analyticlife orb return can hit very hard to be fair but its not exactly a redeeming quality for it since its pitiful bulk means that you wont be able to make use of analytic you just get before being able to pull off a move i have had fun running a subswords dance set in the lower tiers tho that can work pretty well since no one expects anything out of watchog he can also be run as a supportmon with moves like glare confuse ray and toxic plus he does actually get a very diverse movepool to work with that can allow him to function as a decent wall breaker in the lower tiers
pokemon,not_removed,it does have a niche use for shiny hunting illuminate to make encounters more often along with super fang thunder wave and hypnosis make it the best utility pokemon with its ability
pokemon,not_removed,for mightyena i would love to see a sinister bipedal evolution that is also fighting type kind of like mega lopunny but an actual evolution use the dusk stone maybe
pokemon,not_removed,odd stats can be useful especially an odd speed stat having a uniquerare speed stat means less likelihood to encounter speed ties
pokemon,not_removed,oddish has the same sp atk as serperior
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,i thought you were joking
pokemon,not_removed,the clickbait in this thread makes me not want to watch your wifes livestream
pokemon,not_removed,espurr looks so shocked and perplexed all the time i wonder what its thinking too maybe we just dont want to but its what makes espurr adorable i just want to hug it and pet it while it trips on whatever it sees
pokemon,not_removed,poor guy and he just stopped having nam flashbacks too
pokemon,not_removed,i like that latios is dropping a bunch of electrodes as bombs xd
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,lol espurr is just like we need to go
pokemon,not_removed,espurr the restraint pokémon
pokemon,not_removed,ive seen some shit
pokemon,not_removed,rip skarmory
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,drawn corsola wrong
pokemon,not_removed,what if we use future sight to reveal upcoming sm content as well as what the nintendo nx will look like
pokemon,not_removed,if pokémon mystery dungeon has taught me anything its to never fucku with xatu
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,if you ask me espurrs just in a constant state of challenging everyone it sees to an impromptu staring contest ⨀ ⨀
pokemon,not_removed,i love that little thing so damn cute
pokemon,not_removed,huh now i cant unsee xatu having eyenipples weird
pokemon,not_removed,twitches
pokemon,not_removed,im a vietnyan veteran ive seen some shit
pokemon,not_removed,i like how two of the pokemon in the picture wouldnt even be affected by explosion and three of them would resist it
pokemon,not_removed,xdddd
pokemon,not_removed,get to da choppah
pokemon,not_removed,where
pokemon,not_removed,well ya see im pretty sure nintendo payed off andor applied a nda to all the pokemon that can see the future so i doubt that will work
pokemon,not_removed,i win
pokemon,not_removed,fug dddddd
pokemon,not_removed,czech hedgehog
pokemon,not_removed,not helping
pokemon,not_removed,its so funny to see your own art suddenly pop here oh my thanks for the recognition
pokemon,not_removed,deviantart link
pokemon,not_removed,thumbnail made me think it was ekans wrapping around eating something alive
pokemon,not_removed,thats gorgeous
pokemon,not_removed,did you guys play gale of darkness
pokemon,not_removed,youre very welcome your art is lovely and definitely deserves to be recognized keep up the amazing work
pokemon,not_removed,haha maybe that is the next piece ill make ekans eating a rattata perhaps is that too much d
pokemon,not_removed,trigger
pokemon,not_removed,i legitimately want this now
pokemon,not_removed,no effort in altering the original image i love it
pokemon,not_removed,the shittiest of posts
pokemon,not_removed,very cool love lapras myself
pokemon,not_removed,hey there cryptic alliance is a comic creating collab and one of our projects is an ongoing fan comic based in the pokemon universe the story follows a pokemon trainer about to start his kalos journey when he gets mixed up with a thief and aspiring team rocket grunt its ridiculous its fun and major choices are decided by readers starters have already been chosen and were five chapters in but anyone is welcome to join in the fun by visiting our website or if youre on the comic sharing site tapastic were there too if you want to catch up here are the links feel free to let us know what you think in the comments and suggest things for the next instalment
pokemon,not_removed,i rather enjoyed this comic looking forward to more
pokemon,not_removed,id rank this up with fire red hard mode in fan comic quality wish i discovered it much later so i wont have to go through the painful wait
pokemon,not_removed,this is cool make sure you post when is up
pokemon,not_removed,thank you so much were glad you enjoy it and were looking forward to making more as well d
pokemon,not_removed,thank you so much as for the painful wait were trying to keep on it we have an original main comic frames per second which gets priority but aplpa is a fan favorite so were trying to keep a little more on that and hopefully make it more frequent if im frank two things would rapidly speed up the process money and a robot replica of my cryptic alliance partnerartist jante the second would be really useful for now at least the next episode shouldnt be too far off
pokemon,not_removed,this is something i can relate to and im the artist thank you for enjoying my blood sweat and tears haha ill try to get them out quickly so its not as painful a wait jante the mangaka of aplpa
pokemon,not_removed,yus i knew racking up style points would pay off
pokemon,not_removed,thanks so much we will indeed d
pokemon,not_removed,haha thank you it was either a cubone or an umbreon but it turned out that i sucked at drawing umbreon so i went with cubone xd jante mangaka of aplpa
pokemon,not_removed,thank you tut jante the mangaka of aplpa
pokemon,not_removed,httpswwwinstagramcompbgcnipcawbt
pokemon,not_removed,sorry to hear that i dont think it had anything to do with the primarina itself though its more likely just a coincidence
pokemon,not_removed,ive been using this picture as my gamertag image on every platform possible for months now it cracks me up
pokemon,not_removed,maybe an attack like cake devour with a snorlax and the kids pokemon snorlax likes to eat a lot unwrap could be an attack for the birthday boy since hell be unwrapping presents ill keep thinking and get back to you if i come up with more
pokemon,not_removed,i like the idea of using something like piñata pummel as an attack and like suggested here unwrap would be great for the bday boy himself you could also use something like a literal birthday bash move or something like party trick or birthday wish just anything really best thing to do is just look up a few images of the tcg cards draw up a template based on those with a few birthday pun attacks and go from there would love to see what you end up with though maybe more users here would enjoy seeing a few pictures with it being pokémon themed and all good luck either way
pokemon,not_removed,you could use sing for singing happy birthday
pokemon,not_removed,just a thought but maybe some clear or semi clear glitter and like spray sealant or something make holographic cards
pokemon,not_removed,yea thats not a bad idea and just so you know there actually is an incredibly rare pokemon card thats birthday themed
pokemon,not_removed,thats awesome c its definitely a simple yet effective way to show off the party theme in a pokémon card pretty flattered you decided to go with my suggestion im glad i was able to help you out some
pokemon,not_removed,of course im sure wed love to see how it all turns out
pokemon,not_removed,earthquake is the tm that i am always looking forward to in every game
pokemon,not_removed,speaking strictly in game and not competitive if you ask me stier atier move a chance of beneficial side effects atier btier move accuracy btier power and not a ctier ctier power but accuracy andor a negative side effect dtier any move not in an above tier there really should be something better for just casual play if you want to improve your move at this tier edit formatting for the bullet points forgot about them
pokemon,not_removed,thunderbolt ice beam and flamethrower should be s tier tbh if not all at least ice beam and flamethrower since nearly all ingame teams have a water type that can learn ice beam and a fire type that can use flamethrower i would argue energy ball too but as much as i love grass types i know that theyre weaker than others i also feel like shadow ball can make its way to c since most psychic types are taught it
pokemon,not_removed,how about dazzling gleam that was one of my top moves in y especially using an alakazam also i love scald but maybe in game surf is more useful dragon claw shadow claw and aerial ace are pretty good also edit dark pulse was a must have tm when using greninja
pokemon,not_removed,theree no move im more excited to see one of my pokemon learn than close combat the defense drop doesnt even matter since you can just switch them out afterwards
pokemon,not_removed,surf is obviously going to be up there since its always vital to progression in some way in general the moves you listed are the most powerful while still having accuracy and no downsides some others you could include sludge bomb dark pulse energy ball shadow ball etc all powerful moves that dont suffer accuracy penalties
pokemon,not_removed,im on android but httpsclubpokemoncomuspokemontrainerclubeditprofile lets me edit it
pokemon,not_removed,this is how i imagine my life would be if i were a pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,not as lazy as that snorlax lol
pokemon,not_removed,love paleonas work her entire album is just adorable
pokemon,not_removed,stop stalking me
pokemon,not_removed,this is my life right now
pokemon,not_removed,i miss the old pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,we have enough stones so that eevee could just be the stone evolution pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,i wished they all got retconned to being stone evos with sylveon getting a flesh ribbon item to evolve with his trade
pokemon,not_removed,they could just use shiny stone for sylveon it already evolves two fairies out of four total pokemon that evolve with it dusk and dawn for umbreon and espeon respectively thats a stone for each evolution so far
pokemon,not_removed,this is exactly what i was thinking
pokemon,not_removed,bbrock
pokemon,not_removed,ive also heard you guys loved top so ive also made you a quick top of the other most remarkable characters in the pokémon anime this list isnt in any particular order which kinda breaks the concept of a top list but who cares everybody loves having stuff their already know classified over and over again by someone else on the internet apparently we call this entertainment whatever that means i also took the liberty to add a few of my ocs in this list i must say im really proud of it id say its right between my top imaginary legendary pokémon my top imaginary megaevolutions my top imaginary alolan forms and a couple of dozens of my videos with overly excited titles about some imaginary sunmoon leaks even though theres litterally nothing left to reveal but enough digressions now i hope youll enjoy the read
pokemon,not_removed,so what if they created a pokemon specifically able to breed with genderless pokemon they did its called ditto
pokemon,not_removed,how about instead of all of this just make it so that nonlegendary genderless pokemon can breed with ditto or their own speciesline
pokemon,not_removed,they can just change how egg moves work on maleonly and genderless pokémon and thats it we dont need another pokémon to do this
pokemon,not_removed,genderless pokemon have genders its just theres no way to determine what the pokemons gender is so they are deemed genderless so thats why they can breed
pokemon,not_removed,breeding with ditto grants you no egg moves and generally iv breeding is comparatively more tedious than it is with pokemon that have genders and in turn access to full egg groups of pokemon they can breed with what im suggesting is a compact sort of way to address these things
pokemon,not_removed,give this post all of the upvotes
pokemon,not_removed,that wouldnt actually make it so that they can get egg moves though
pokemon,not_removed,we shouldnt no that much i agree with im just suggesting something that would apply within the existing mechanics of the game to get around things as they are now i do have to say the way people are reacting to this is genuinely surprising to me are people just that against new or different ideas or something goodness gracious for a series ripe with imagination and creativity no offense but im not seeing much of it from the community right now
pokemon,not_removed,right hence the solve its not like its a drastic problem or something but it is a way to go about these inconveniences and such without just turning all of these established genderless pokemon into ones that have gender though that would be ideal really
pokemon,not_removed,while that works from a lore perspective and all even setting aside how weird it is for game mechanics its just weird how some pokemon work that way and others dont were literally in a situation where it almost looks like they pointed to some rocks and said okay those have genders then pointed to others and went but those dont and left it at that with how many odd things do have gender at this point it seems like a workaround would be a fair way of at least giving these pokemon access to the stuff theyre missing mechanically if hey dont want to just do away with that bit of lore on a generation jump like they did from rby to gsc
pokemon,not_removed,you can pass egg moves even through ditto breeding iv breeding isnt difficult not when you have a iv ditto which can easily be obtained
pokemon,not_removed,op makes it seem like theres some kind of problem with the breeding system it works just fine as is
pokemon,not_removed,if it gets them i think that just speaks to the communitys reading comprehension more than anything ditto doesnt address what is being discussed here if you think it does then you probably didnt read the whole of the post
pokemon,not_removed,can you show me where any genderless pokemon has their egg moves listed then if im mistaken im all for revising this but i do not see the pokemon im referring to as being listed for being able to get egg moves easily but not easily and legitimately as far as im aware thats sort of the point
pokemon,not_removed,no i pointed out genderless pokemon lack the benefits pokemon with genders have from being able to breed though it does extend to male only pokemon too ditto does not actually address these things ironically female only species do have all of these benefits though a miltank has egg moves is easier to breed ivs for and so on the same is not as true for tauros
pokemon,not_removed,i contributed my shitpost what did i get in all honesty its actually pretty goddamn funny
pokemon,not_removed,arceus please
pokemon,not_removed,i have neither
pokemon,not_removed,i would appreciate it so much if i could get a darkrai i missed the event and its my favorite pokémon httpsimgurcomansafg
pokemon,not_removed,it would be awesome if i could get an arceus i dont have one at all
pokemon,not_removed,need arceus heres proof
pokemon,not_removed,arceus andor darkrai would be great thanks
pokemon,not_removed,i would love an arceus i dont have one yet
pokemon,not_removed,i would love a darkrai code please edit just got home from work is a photo of my pokedex for darkrai thank you
pokemon,not_removed,my gamestop in my town ran out of arceus codes could i please have one
pokemon,not_removed,i couldn´t get a darkrai code as it didn´t come to méxico
pokemon,not_removed,go to a nintendo zone location that has the streetpass relay so mcdonalds or starbucks youll get the last people that were there as streetpasses more than likely youll get it
pokemon,not_removed,use the questions thread
pokemon,not_removed,dragon all the eeveelutions have been types that did special damage prior to the physical special split the only exception is fairy which hadnt been introduced but judging by the fact theres literally only physical fairy move it too would have been special the only type left that was formally special is dragon typing plus it works as an opposite to sylveon
pokemon,not_removed,id like to see a normal eeveelution by level up back story as to the reason no one knew about it is at a low level eevee was introduced to the elemental stones like all pokémon and was one of the few pokémon able to evolve using them ever since then it became popular to have an eeveelution like the ones we all know instead of a normal type
pokemon,not_removed,id like poison or steel bug would look so strange but id be interested in seeing it
pokemon,not_removed,id love to see a ghost eeveelution ive proposed this idea previously but ive thought about it more since then a ghost type where instead of the ones ive seen where you need your eevee to die it needs to be holding a spell tag at night with three hearts of affection or it needs to know a ghost move instead of a fairy one instead of it evolving into umbreon or sylveon it evolves into a ghost type since id see a ghost type eeveelution loving its trainer so much itd never want to leave their side like a guardian spirit working name is paranormeon but theres plenty of other name ideas
pokemon,not_removed,normal eeveelution that would look exactly like an eevee but larger
pokemon,not_removed,i think flying would be cool kinda like a mini pegasus
pokemon,not_removed,ghost type polteon working name achieved when eevee is the last pokemon on the team that hadnt been fainted is holding spell tag and has high friendship once he faints you are treated to an evolution screen prompted to teach it new moves and start the match where you left off but now using polteon
pokemon,not_removed,since every eeveelution has been a pregen iii special type aside from sylveon though fairy does seem like it wouldve been a special type im expecting dragon its the only one that has not received an eeveelution so its what im expecting i would like to see a bugtype but dragon should definitely come first
pokemon,not_removed,steeleon
pokemon,not_removed,well maybe a bug type a mothlooking eevee would be interesing
pokemon,not_removed,ghost or bug
pokemon,not_removed,id kind of like to see a new pokemon which evolves into a different form for every physical element
pokemon,not_removed,spookeon use a knife on the eevee from the inventory
pokemon,not_removed,i think they should do a ghost type just cause it would be awesome to see it could evolve when it faints in battle if there is another ghost type in the party thematically to trap its spirit
pokemon,not_removed,ghost
pokemon,not_removed,ground or rock tectoneon
pokemon,not_removed,i mean dark was a special type but there was only one special dark move in gen i see your point though
pokemon,not_removed,what about you use an everstone on it
pokemon,not_removed,bug could have more of a butterfly theme to it
pokemon,not_removed,the bug one could be anteon and have mandiblespincers on its mouth poison eevee could be toxeon or sludgeon steel eevee could be steeleon or oreon
pokemon,not_removed,whispeon
pokemon,not_removed,your idea is great but the name doesnt fit tbh all eeveelutions are twothree syllables long four is a bit too long i think spectreon is a pretty good name
pokemon,not_removed,with competitive stats
pokemon,not_removed,so similar to the growlithearcanine line id love that
pokemon,not_removed,eeveon plaineon normaleon
pokemon,not_removed,and it should be the one that can mega evolve
pokemon,not_removed,really good idea but i dont think theyd do a midbattle evolution
pokemon,not_removed,or just let eevee do that
pokemon,not_removed,if thats not quite sufficient then how about this prior to fairy type there were types of which were physical prior to gen special if fairy had been introduced prior to the split it would have most likely been made a special type to even the two attack types up
pokemon,not_removed,that could work if they somehow explain that due to eevees strange dna the everstone works in reverse of its intended design
pokemon,not_removed,how about honeybeon
pokemon,not_removed,ooo i like that name
pokemon,not_removed,spectreons a neat one a friend also suggested geisteon like poltergeist
pokemon,not_removed,it could be evoluteon
pokemon,not_removed,i like it
pokemon,not_removed,or am i overthinking this because im butthurt this lots of evos go in a separate direction than the base form and a lot of pokemon look drastically different from their base form without a middle evo to bridge them
pokemon,not_removed,youre butthurt its your opinion that its a bad design litten doesnt have spikes its fur standing up and the trio doesnt have to make sense starters dont have to have a common theme keep in mind that people hated greninjas design when he was first leaked and now hes quite literally according to that poll the most popular pokemon as of right now give it time besides maybe littens evo will be like typhlosion and go on all fours occasionally
pokemon,not_removed,were both butthurt dude
pokemon,not_removed,lots of starters look drastically different in their final evos and has the spikes you mentioned around its neck besides while it isnt as coolheaded as litten it does look passionate maybe its inner passion and emotions come out the problem is that littens description is almost too blankslateish to make any argument for the direction it should go in unlike rowlet which almost too clearly screams archerassassin and the one the leaks went in works with what they have besides the trio does make sense performance specifically performance archery strongman wwe wrestling and singingacrobatics
pokemon,not_removed,yea ok
pokemon,not_removed,ok
pokemon,not_removed,i like how you seem to be trying to start a discussion to hear everyone elses opinions yet you give snarky remarks when people try to show their side of the discussion
pokemon,not_removed,i wasnt trying to be snarky i just saw this comment and realised how how stupid and butthurt i was over this and decided to delete it alsohis shoulders are to broad to go quadped
pokemon,not_removed,my favourite is the psyduck one
pokemon,not_removed,that mashing the a b buttons would increase the odds of a pokemon staying instead the pokeball
pokemon,not_removed,when blue came out i used to catch and raise caterpies until they became butterfrees i would then release them at the pewter city poke center and go to viridian forrest in hopes of finding them again
pokemon,not_removed,the classic rumor in gen about getting to take the space shuttle to the moon to catch deoxys
pokemon,not_removed,that arbok evolved into seviper thanks anime
pokemon,not_removed,gen i thought psychic moves worked better on dumblooking pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,i thought you could only have pokemon ever
pokemon,not_removed,i was gonna make a thread like this yesterday glad you did way back in pokemon red when you got poisoned youd get that screen effect i always thought my cart was glitching i discovered the cure for the glitch was the pokemon center it took me awhile to put it together that it was poison
pokemon,not_removed,i believed in the mist stone in unknown dungeon does that count it was supposed to be near mewtwo in the water only found with itemfinder and really hard to find because the itemfinder would rarely actually detect it it was used to evolve mewtwo into mew
pokemon,not_removed,i once tried to use xattack as a held item
pokemon,not_removed,i thought rock was immune against eletric attacks
pokemon,not_removed,i once used a master ball on a machop bc i thought it would be one of those pokemon that you would never see again
pokemon,not_removed,i loaded them up with all of the same type at one point my charizard knew ember flamethrower fire blast and fire spin
pokemon,not_removed,my cousin told me that zigzagoon evolves into rayquaza so i leveled my zigzagoon to level and nothing happened
pokemon,not_removed,because gastly was right after cloyster in the pokedex and they both had a big black ball for a head i thought cloyster evolves to gastly
pokemon,not_removed,in gen we had no idea what was physical and special so i thought moves like hyper beam were special given it is a beam
pokemon,not_removed,that cheat code where a pokeball becomes as strong as a master ball
pokemon,not_removed,i always thought grass wasnt very effective against ghosts because of the gengar line
pokemon,not_removed,i use to think that your starter had to be in your party at all times
pokemon,not_removed,i tried so hard to complete the pokedex not knowing that ill never get a trade evo mew or celebi
pokemon,not_removed,i thought back in gen that once you get pokemon thats your team and you cant get more than that i remember not catching anything to get to mount moon for a zubat needless to say i found the pc in the pokemon center
pokemon,not_removed,that every pokemon i saw in rse was from hoenn
pokemon,not_removed,i thought something crazy would happen if you caught all the different types of unknown in the ruins of aplh as a kid i spent so much time in there
pokemon,not_removed,that pokemon was just a tv show and that the games were nothing more then cash grab games based off of the show and therefore had very little quality man i was fuckin wrong
pokemon,not_removed,that if you held your breath and didnt move while trying to catch a pokemon it would work
pokemon,not_removed,well ive been playing since red the but only things i remember are to do with game mechanics panicking that my firered had broken because my mon was poisoned and scrambling the picture every few steps having to search on the internet to find out if i could evolve my shiny poochyena in emerald without losing its shinyness then of course theres the classic ab flawless catching method
pokemon,not_removed,for the longest time i still couldnt figure out sudowoodos type even after playing hg and watching the sudowoodo episode of the anime
pokemon,not_removed,that charizard is a dragon he is not
pokemon,not_removed,that fire did damage to ice solely
pokemon,not_removed,for a long time i thought the only two options in battle were fight pkmn and item run
pokemon,not_removed,i thought that rattatas were faster than raticates but raticates were tougher judged it based on the appearance of one being fat and slow the other lean and mean same with pikachu raichu etc
pokemon,not_removed,i used to think that psychic moves were super effective against grass thats because of psychic pokemon battling my venusaur also i didnt know about the split between physical and special attackdefense until the gen im dumb wait theres more i could never hurt sudowoodo much because i kept forgetting its typing i thought that when you watered it it attacked you because you were annoying it not because its weak to water
pokemon,not_removed,i carried over the types from the card game into firered when i first played it as a result i thought that butterfree and ekans were both grass type i also had a few of those delta species cards where the pokemon doesnt have its correct type like i have a steel type pikachu and a fire type mankey this led me to believe that i could catch the same pokemon twice and end up with two different types after much confusion i figured it out though lol
pokemon,not_removed,i had the strategy guide for redblue and it mentioned that bulbasaur was useful for going through viridian forest because it couldnt be poisoned by weedles poison sting year old me misinterpreted this to mean that it was completely immune to the attack i also thought rock smash was a rock type move to match rock throw and rock slide
pokemon,not_removed,if you catch the evolved form of a pokemon you have before you evolve that one you should use the more recent catch because its evolved and therefore automatically better
pokemon,not_removed,super mario sunshine made me subconsciously think water did more damage against poison or at least against muk and grimer
pokemon,not_removed,i ignored the whole concept of stats all through rb gs and rs in i finally got a ds and played hgss by the end of that game obviously too late i realized they were you know very important i played dp right after that and changed my ways maybe i thought they were just for show or something i really have no good idea why me didnt care to acknowledge them anyway thank you miltank for not doing any damage with surf and therefore setting me on the correct pokepath
pokemon,not_removed,when my brothers and i first started playing pokemon we thought geodude was pronounced geh dee kind of like spaghetti we were young and our reading wasnt the greatest ••
pokemon,not_removed,ive got two bad moments i never understood the concept of switching pokemon around to train them i ended up with a lvl typhlosion and the rest of the team being lvl in gold version through the elite it took me forever to get past azalea town my first time playing gold wasnt until i got assistance from uncle that i was able to continue with my adventure
pokemon,not_removed,a friend told me that shouting gotcha into the mic would increase the chance of catching pokémon i proceeded to make a fool of myself for many years to come
pokemon,not_removed,that ash was the best pokemon trainer ever
pokemon,not_removed,i used battle items and potions as held items
pokemon,not_removed,i thought that effectiveness of moves was based on predatorprey relationships spearow were effective against pikachu rather than type advantagesdisadvantages edit to clarify i thought that spearow were a species of predatory birds because of their evolution fearow which by that logic should have made them effective against prey pokemon like pikachu and rattata young me never understood why pikachus electric attacks were always making my captured spearow faint and why my spearows pecks were always ineffective against pikachu long story short i did not realize back then that supereffective moves were based on the typing of the pokemon and not on what species they are
pokemon,not_removed,my version of this was pressing b at the precise moment the poke ball shook and on the last shake i had to hold both a and b by dumb luck first time i tried this i caught the pokemon and from then on kept trying this method
pokemon,not_removed,oh god yes even now i have to restrain myself from doing it
pokemon,not_removed,mine was holding up b select
pokemon,not_removed,thats adorable
pokemon,not_removed,and then they made you go to space to get him in the remakes its like it came full circle
pokemon,not_removed,classic
pokemon,not_removed,what episode are you talking about
pokemon,not_removed,same every time i got poisoned i would panic that my cartridge was glitching out before i realised even when i did i would still panic after the first hitch
pokemon,not_removed,i also never made the connection im not sure when i finally noticed it was poison
pokemon,not_removed,and to evolve charizard blastoise and venusaur to charcoal rainer and the other thing
pokemon,not_removed,im and ive only been playing pokemon for five years started with diamond in just after bw came out and i tried to use a tm as a held item after i managed to teach a hm
pokemon,not_removed,i could see thinking that in gen since like all of the rock types were ground except for the fossil pokemon but they were rate enough that you probably didnt encounter them very much same thing in gen so the rock types that werent also ground were pretty rare
pokemon,not_removed,this i thought fighting was as well and i remember so clearly when i figured out you could thunderbolt a machop pokemon yellow taught me so much i think i thought it because of the trading cards ground rock and fighting all have that same brown hand symbol
pokemon,not_removed,omg i think i used my master ball on an abra was a damn good alakhazam tho
pokemon,not_removed,this in fire red not only did my blastoise have four water moves it was also the only pokemon that i had actually trained running into opponents with water absorb was not fun
pokemon,not_removed,gotta get those same type attack bonuses
pokemon,not_removed,that is both hilarious and sad
pokemon,not_removed,as long as it had pickup as an ability it wasnt a complete waste of time pickup gets you better items at high levels iirc
pokemon,not_removed,isnt hyper beam special
pokemon,not_removed,in pokemon colosseum this was actually a thing use the master ball on pokemon on your second pokemon swap the position of the master ball with something else boom unlimited master balls
pokemon,not_removed,i was so mad i did this too
pokemon,not_removed,that shit pissed me off so bad why the fuck game freak didnt take advantage of this obvious set up ill never understand
pokemon,not_removed,its actually a really clever name sudo pseudo fake so sudowoodo means fake wood because its not actually a grass type
pokemon,not_removed,well to be fair it is kinda attacking you because it thinks youre annoying for watering it and because its weak to water
pokemon,not_removed,wait it doesnt help
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,its like it came full circle orbit ftfy
pokemon,not_removed,this trainers choice probably
pokemon,not_removed,probably due to jessie having an arbok then eventually a seviper i could be wrong its been a long time since ive watched the anime
pokemon,not_removed,idk but its in the hoenn saga
pokemon,not_removed,did any of the trainers even have an aerodactyl lance is the only candidate that comes to mind
pokemon,not_removed,lol at least he worked out for you i dont think i used my machop at all
pokemon,not_removed,as many as i can apparently haha
pokemon,not_removed,accumulate enough same type attack bonuses and youll receive the exclusive limited edition same type attack discounttermsandconditionsapply
pokemon,not_removed,before diamondpearl moves were physicalspecial based strictly on their type so all normal moves were physical including hyper beam and tri attack physical types were normal flying ground rock fighting ghost poison bug steel special types were water fire grass electric ice psychic dragon dark
pokemon,not_removed,not until gen gen it was a normal move and normal type moves were all physical
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,leak no official info oct
pokemon,not_removed,official info is set for october and corocoro should leak around days after that
pokemon,not_removed,more like days
pokemon,not_removed,whats corocoro
pokemon,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikicorocorocomic
pokemon,not_removed,no
pokemon,not_removed,unfortunately or fortunately depending if you value the rarity of the master ball not
pokemon,not_removed,i think it reverts back to a regular pokeball on the offsprings
pokemon,not_removed,try a dusk or nest ball if you want some style personally i go out of my way to have the basic poke ball be the only one on my team
pokemon,not_removed,sadly no we need more purple pokeballs
pokemon,not_removed,what a shame
pokemon,not_removed,i knew i wasnt the only one who preferred regular pokéballs
pokemon,not_removed,the pokeball has been good enough for years im going to stick with it heck i still catch legendaries for gen that was sugaleo and the tapu in pokeballs it annoyed me that the ultra beasts needed to be caught in beast balls to do it effectively
pokemon,not_removed,this league series must be faced in order each room has an added effect that changes the conditions of battle attack a heavily offensive team designed to work through both physical and special threats few of the attackers are mixed as part of the challenge a new weather condition called superatmosphere starts up automatically this condition functions like the pressure ability except it cant be turned off in the room pokemon with pressure have the effect doubled probably fire themed upon victory the elite four member hands you max elixirs to represent the remaining challenges ahead defense a heavily defensive team focused on abusing tanks status conditions and stall tactics an earth themed room it automatically sets up grassy terrain either steel ground or grass themed upon victory the member hands you home grown sitrus berries as a reminder to take it easy once in a while and share some time with another speed a team of rapidfire lancers in trick room this one would be a topsy turvy mix of extremely slow pokemon with a boost from trick room which automatically sets up turn one as part of the challenge lasts turns per pokemon the elite four member places active reset by switches psychic based upon victory the player receives a max revive because the rather taciturn elite four member says youre gonna need it kid luck the final chamber this chamber is made of pokemon that abuse abilities and mechanics to cause paraflinch hax sniper critical hits and actually let focus blast hit likely fairy water or fighting based the chamber is built like a giant roulette wheel this chambers mechanic is called scramble switching pokemon does not consume a turn but makes your attacks including status attacks points more likely to miss upon victory the player is congratulated for making their own luck and receives the key item poker chip to commemorate their victory champions chamber hmm what to pick the balance chamber nope the rng chamber hah welcome to my chamber of mystery your career as a competitive pokemon master is nearing its end as in im about to put it out of its misery anybody with a brain can crush through this league so youre not really all that special the only thing in life that isnt certain that cant be planned for and defeated is chance so since thats the only thing even skilled people cant beat lets play a game of chance think youve got what it takes to defeat the invisible hand the champion is a risk taker too so this chambers effect could be any one of the four previous or any of the known weather conditions constantly rotating the team of pokemon dragonite always starts ttar salamence metagross garchomp hydreigon goodra noivern hakamoo oh yeah i forgot to mention they switch out every time you face them you you cant predict exactly whats coming out each pokemon that can knows dragon dance for extra sweeping while those that cant get protect and they will abuse it despite being branded as an rng champion there are definitive strategies goodra and metagross are primarily defensive while ttar garchomp and noivern are all out offensive hakamoo is mixed while salamence and dragonite have speed and hp spreads oh heck lets give hakamoo metronome too to top it off one of those pokemon will mega evolve but you wont know which they have two hold item options settled randomly before the match items like leftovers assault vest weakness policy life orb or the mega stone not too believable but a fun concept you could easily get lucky with things hat boost your team or you might not

pokemon,not_removed,that champion seems like it would definitely be a challenge thats for sure i love the route you took with this idea truly unique good stuff my friend
pokemon,not_removed,i like it great idea
pokemon,not_removed,thanks man i actually had to put some thought in it since i didnt want it to seem like a regular league
pokemon,not_removed,ill get an archive when its possible edit httpimgurcomafbghu
pokemon,not_removed,if this is the final evolution of grubbin i am so using one
pokemon,not_removed,clearly fake
pokemon,not_removed,wow if theyre fakes theyre damn impressive fakes
pokemon,not_removed,well they did leak what appears to be its first evo that looks like a battery cocoon and vikavolt does have grubbins prongs
pokemon,not_removed,have gym pokes have a range of levels that increase based on your teams average level ex gym uses default level pokes but if you come in with a level the leaders pokes increase to gives a reason to grind to level have opponent pokes be ev trained and carry good items they are competitive trainers after all allow gym rematches with stronger pokes make a dualregion like hgss
pokemon,not_removed,autoscaling no free handouts of powerful pokemon no early mega stones trainers dont wait to mega evolve until the last second trainers switch more often to cover weaknesses
pokemon,not_removed,perhaps offer a challenge mode like what they did in gen
pokemon,not_removed,make tutorials optional instead of making the erroneous assumption that everyone who plays this year old game is either a child or needs their hand held smarter ai and better use of moves as a result let npcs use hold items again stop healing my party for me looking at you may please do not hand out legendary pokemon as a reward for doing nothing especially not after badges for the love of god tone down all the railroading let players decide who receives shared exp and who doesnt basically you can turn it on or off for any andor all members of the team instead of making everybody grow by default
pokemon,not_removed,autoscaling enemy trainers to equal to or just about your teams average level for the first encounter oras sort of does that with the trainers eye but only on the repeat battles
pokemon,not_removed,level fixing for certain battles and allowing more trainers to switch and use items
pokemon,not_removed,as already mentioned a scaling system would work also increasing the number of pokemon special trainers have such as the elite four and gym leaders from a certain point on third or fourth gym they just shouldve six pokemon more use of items would be nice as well also all trainers should have great ai and be able to switch pokemon as well
pokemon,not_removed,better level balancing
pokemon,not_removed,were all in agreement that mostnone of this will happen right
pokemon,not_removed,give gym leaders real power gamefreak can take a few pointers from pokemon reborn sometimes a frustrating battle that takes a few tries and some clever thinking to beat can be the most rewarding and memorable i still remember elesa because of her stupid emolgas immunity to ground types the first time id ever been denied a straight up type advantage curbstomp in pokemon and she remains one of my favorite gym leaders because of it a gym leaders should feel like a decent midboss not a hyped up youngster joey at the end of a childfriendly rollercoaster gym they should have more pokemon most players have a full team before their first gym specifically more pokemon to cover their weaknesses the grass leader packing rock moves the water leader packing poisonfire the fighting leader packing dark etc they should also have a homefield advantage whether its a weather effect or automatic stealth rocktoxic spikes they should use double battles in conjunction with clever strategies like fairy gym with designated healers and attackers they should bring back whitneys miltank my point is they should make gyms harder because pokemon is about developing your team to surpass a gyms challenges not steamrolling battles as xp fodder for your team
pokemon,not_removed,the real way to make it reasonably challenging is to make the ai better without cheating every other way is either fake difficulty or simply not an improvement or both
pokemon,not_removed,give gym leaders more than pokemon that dont just have preset levels but instead scale within levels to the highest leveled pokemon in your team also improve the ai
pokemon,not_removed,i posted this as a reply to a comment a few weeks ago but id like to repost here for this discussion ive seen a few things done that made fan made games more challenging things like reducing the level pokemon listen to you for each badge have gym leaders carry pokemon give gym leaders more powerful tms for you to earn that give them an advantage also not having access to whole team exp share until after your badge or elite four would be nice i like thinking i need to round out my teams levels before challenging a gym lol id be curious to see how other people feel about it
pokemon,not_removed,considering you have it set so online makes everyone level why not just do that after a certain point in the game even go the extra mile and make it so you are by default going to be set say levels lower than a certain hard enemy is supposed to be but on the flipside they get only four pokemon or something
pokemon,not_removed,ill give you and agree with some of these but hgss just proves the game doesnt get more difficult with two regions it proves you get easy gym leaders an easy elite four a weak initial region a second region lacking in content save running to gyms and pokemon so displaced people wont realize what generation they had their debut in for years after the fact in my experience at least
pokemon,not_removed,but allowing players to choose it right at the beginning without having to beat the game
pokemon,not_removed,this this was going to be my comment scale the levels so you arent so high make them just above just below or right at
pokemon,not_removed,id say close to none knowing gamefreak
pokemon,not_removed,i miss when gyms themselves had curveballs and trainers in them that would have completely out there pokemon they mightve fit a theme but not necessarily a type
pokemon,not_removed,heres why win battles in a row without healing when your team is the exact same level as theirs good luck if they heal your team after every single battle then its a different game entirely the idea of the elite is that you pull through its a challenge where you can only use what you have with you sure if you have revives you can do that but scaling your team down is an absolute killer your training post level is now worthless if you dont have items youre now at a serious disadvantage because you have to fight in a row and they fight only one if they scale the other team up to compensate then that makes the problem even worse
pokemon,not_removed,kinda like how the rom hacks of blaze black and volt white
pokemon,not_removed,did you only read part of my post i wasnt referring to circumstances like that with the example with what i offered the random and singular hard enemy gets a level advantage but you get an advantage in party size item access and of course the ability to retry thats fairly balanced i would think i wasnt saying the whole game would work that way just offering one example i made up as a way of using what they already have on online they could have it be like certain trainers could say things like i want to use x rules or something and i mean when you get down to it there really isnt a point in training past these days except to get high level movesevolutions if youre done by then why waste the time
pokemon,not_removed,aye those hacks were amazing
pokemon,not_removed,did you only read part of my post no i offered my opinion on each point the random and singular hard enemy gets a level advantage but you get an advantage in party size item access and of course the ability to retry and i said win battles in a row without healing when your team is the exact same level as theirs sure if you have revives you can do that but scaling your team down is an absolute killer so you said just offering one example i made up as a way of using what they already have on online and i noted that if they heal your team after every single battle then its a different game entirely which is what happens online if they do that after every battle as is what happens online then you dont even need items anymore and that points moot your bag is unusable in online play they could have it be like certain trainers could say things like i want to use x rules or something you didnt say this in your original post no problems there could be those rules sky battles inverse battles all of those weird rules already exist so this could be a scaled battle rule that some trainers employ there really isnt a point in training past these days because the level scaling is low fight red atop mt silver with level you probably can still win but youre at such an enormous level disadvantage that it isnt worth it back to the original post though you are by default going to be set say levels lower than a certain hard enemy is supposed to be but on the flipside they get only four pokemon or something so lets go back to the elite conundrum you have level they have collectively level doable definitely requires items definitely if you have a type and level advantage you might not even need to use items but if we go by how it works online which is a decent comparison to this you have no bag items and you get healed after every battle which would make this challenge go back to doable because even without bag items i think the scaled challenge is actually quite a cool one but in order to actually implement it how youre saying it changes the game a huge amount or makes it an incredible grind where not only do you need a well structured team you also need a hell of a lot of items im all for reducing the dependency on items by grinding anyway which is what we can do now if you dont want to grind your pokemon to then thats cool but id rather not need full restores and revives and instead grind my team to be stronger
pokemon,not_removed,im currently doing a nuzlocke with oh god
pokemon,not_removed,dude thats sick typhlosion is favorite fire starter next to infernape
pokemon,not_removed,damn thats fantastic absolutely post an update when you get it coloured i think its fine as it is but if you want to expand you can add the other fire starters around it like a charizard flying around the side or something
pokemon,not_removed,absolutely sick
pokemon,not_removed,did someone say infernape heres my first tattoo
pokemon,not_removed,yea i was thinking of doing other starters i just gotta figure out how i would want to color it
pokemon,not_removed,oh its that art i love how they turned the sun wukong level up to eleven
pokemon,not_removed,he looks like he should be wearing a hat for some reasonits the hand positioning i think
pokemon,not_removed,wondering how i can color in the cyndaquil and others its kind of on the side of my arm but i wanted to add more things to my arm to make it some type of halfsleeve kind of thing
pokemon,not_removed,lol i can see that
pokemon,not_removed,this is sweet
pokemon,not_removed,advertisment alert
pokemon,not_removed,took over sr to get mine for some reason many people that i know of have been very unlucky with shiny mewtwo there was some guy on rshinypokemon that spent sr before he got it
pokemon,not_removed,i will never understand how people find the patience to reset the same battle over and over again more than thousand times how many weeks or months mustnt that have taken to get that one single pokémon
pokemon,not_removed,dang lol i recently got all of the musketeers on as terrakion shined last night pretty easily actually got all easily
pokemon,not_removed,you think thats long theres this one guy that has been hunting for a shiny natu in the safari zone for years
pokemon,not_removed,how has he not given up yet i would have lost all faith after a single week the patience some people have is simply amazing
pokemon,not_removed,he got it eventually but seriously two years i cant soft reset more then two hours before i say fuck it and just catch the pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,this is more unsettling than regular jynx
pokemon,not_removed,ive always been a fan of jynx her body is made of shadow so shes basically just a ghost inhabiting a costume and a wig which is somehow creepier to me than mimikyu
pokemon,not_removed,that was the goal
pokemon,not_removed,duuuuude nice one ᕙ░ಥ╭͜ʖ╮ಥ░━☆ﾟ･｡ﾟ
pokemon,not_removed,looks amazing
pokemon,not_removed,i wish i could draw like that
pokemon,not_removed,thank you d might chuck a couple more on here soon
pokemon,not_removed,based on post which is a theory that arceus is actually one of the thousand arms which make a bigger being and someone compared arceus to a hand so i decided to make this the rest of arceus
pokemon,not_removed,what would you do with arms though use at once to complete your shiny dex
pokemon,not_removed,i would actually give it a thousand arms or at least fifty
pokemon,not_removed,too many arms
pokemon,not_removed,looks cool but is it the main arceus or an arm
pokemon,not_removed,saitama is that you
pokemon,not_removed,arceus megazord
pokemon,not_removed,maybe the real arceus is an eldritch abomination
pokemon,not_removed,looks like a digimon tbh
pokemon,not_removed,player battle royals at once
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,youre not done yet

pokemon,not_removed,rowlet looks perfect for pokemon art academy remember that
pokemon,not_removed,i just my own chalk pokemon great minds think alike
pokemon,not_removed,without zooming in oshawott and pickup look the same i was confused for a second
pokemon,not_removed,litten got hawt sauce in her bag swag
pokemon,not_removed,wow that guys first name is literally the coolest name ever of all time
pokemon,not_removed,holy shit this is the dopest thing ive ever seen on this subreddit maybe he dopes pokemon fan art ive ever seen also you made the title of this post a beyoncé reference so here i am now asking you to be my friend thank you ps where is this ryan
pokemon,not_removed,👌
pokemon,not_removed,he passed me rip
pokemon,not_removed,ooh thats pretty dope o
pokemon,not_removed,nice to see the nerd flag fly in lex keep up the good work and grats on your hl article too
pokemon,not_removed,a little late to this but i wanted to say how happy this made me when i was driving downtown and you made it into the herald leader
pokemon,not_removed,no orginal why
pokemon,not_removed,no originals
pokemon,not_removed,oh my god look at this cultural appropriation s
pokemon,not_removed,why you only draw the ugly ones
pokemon,not_removed,plot twist it was ops friend who posted the unfinished work
pokemon,not_removed,see i told that vandalism claiming guy it was chalk haha what a dick on a side note this came out fantastic op does it continue after piplup
pokemon,not_removed,i like my starters with that grass fire waterrrr i like my starters with adorable featuresss earned all these badges but they never take the starting town out me i got poke balls in my bag swag
pokemon,not_removed,im a quitter got too tired chalking in the sun
pokemon,not_removed,because gen starters are the best gen starters chimchar for life
pokemon,not_removed,hours in had my arms tired and chalk supply scarce
pokemon,not_removed,probably because theyre ass
pokemon,not_removed,because everyone and their mother focuses on them
pokemon,not_removed,definitely shame about the evolutions though
pokemon,not_removed,totodile
pokemon,not_removed,i think you have an autocorrect problem it corrected chimchar as chespin
pokemon,not_removed,they all coordinated their dead eyes too its kinda creepy
pokemon,not_removed,will do thanks a ton
pokemon,not_removed,i cant not hear this when i listen to formation
pokemon,not_removed,hours on main street in lexington ky
pokemon,not_removed,i guess autocorrect corrected piplup to pickup
pokemon,not_removed,lexington ky lets be friends
pokemon,not_removed,did you disable inbox replies because wow this is a terrible post
pokemon,not_removed,so what are the good ones then
pokemon,not_removed,probably is the earlier guy barely posts on reddit and hasnt been on rpokemon in several months timing for his sudden return is a bit too convenient with op showing us the finished result just hours later either way though fantastic job with these op would love to see something like this when i walk down the street
pokemon,not_removed,what makes him a dick and it being chalk doesnt mean its not vandalism
pokemon,not_removed,blasphemy
pokemon,not_removed,there ya go
pokemon,not_removed,not only is it adorable but it evolves into a badass
pokemon,not_removed,cyndaquil endthread
pokemon,not_removed,na obviously they meant to type fennekin also you spelled chimchar wrong
pokemon,not_removed,yep
pokemon,not_removed,i see your art at eku and now on my street were meant to be friends that bear outside cammack was awesome
pokemon,not_removed,generation and
pokemon,not_removed,and i lurk more then i post i work in the building thats behind the drawing i was coming from starbucks and we wernt sure if he was suppost to do that or not thats when my coworker went out to look at it
pokemon,not_removed,im living rent free inside your head
pokemon,not_removed,why did that make you so mad
pokemon,not_removed,youre joking right
pokemon,not_removed,fire water
pokemon,not_removed,but thats simply an opinion
pokemon,not_removed,haha fair enough im just the resident cynic when it comes to coincidences nice catch then
pokemon,not_removed,cool its probably very empty in there huh imdum edit happy cake day
pokemon,not_removed,about what why do you ask that
pokemon,not_removed,its a general opionion if someone will make a global poll not only for the hardcore pokemon reddit fans the majority will have that opinion diamond and pearl starters and the new fire cat looks ok but lets face it the rest of them looks like are made for babies
pokemon,not_removed,its not really a coincidence if somebody sees someone else making pokemon related material they are damn well going to post it just because they dont post very often it doesnt mean its convenient
pokemon,not_removed,there is a lot of porn though the weird kind
pokemon,not_removed,wasnt me bro why so sensitive first about the vandalism guy and now your imaginary internet points your comment had been up minutes by the time i saw it why so confident it was me who downvoted and why do you even care in the first place
pokemon,not_removed,not necessarily the gen starters and all of gen designs really have this dumb simplicity and overused feel to them they just feel so separated from the rest of the pokemon gen feels so out of place i like every starter trio except gen every starter is cool in there own right you cant generalize the community
pokemon,not_removed,i thought we were talking about my head not yours
pokemon,not_removed,did you just took a shitpost at heart its ok dude i dont actually think that your head is full of weird porn or maybe it is i dont judge that
pokemon,not_removed,youre on reddit nothing is over
pokemon,not_removed,i dont get it i thought we were just joking
pokemon,not_removed,its never ogre this is my swamp s
pokemon,not_removed,oh i noticed that my post was downvoted when i received your message and i thought that maybe you took it personally no big deal then
pokemon,not_removed,water gun fine scald brine muddy water i ill pass
pokemon,not_removed,i would really hope one of my pokemon knew rain dance
pokemon,not_removed,from certain pokemon maybe a suicune but nothing like barboach
pokemon,not_removed,i have a solution not in a water type but ice instead vanilluxe stockpiles up massive amounts of water like a camel to fuel its ice attacks and it is made of pure ice so you dont have to worry about saliva or body fluids so it has fresh literally icecold water and even has a handy straw though youd probably get on some pokephilia list if youre seen getting a drink from that though the only water moves it learns is water pulse and rain dance so probably best to just let it rain
pokemon,not_removed,its sterile and i like the taste
pokemon,not_removed,if i wasnt thirsty id still drink it
pokemon,not_removed,my milotic knows scald least i know its sterile then again thats also the same mouth that she spews highly toxic sludge from
pokemon,not_removed,if its a suicune then yes
pokemon,not_removed,depends if i have to take it straight from the source the impact would probably take my head off joke if its life or death yeah without a doubt just a casual drink probably just find a fountain and save them the trouble
pokemon,not_removed,only from a suicune the water purifier pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,aaaactually yeah it just kina depends think i mean i think id have a few reservations about doing some kinda mouthtomouth water gun thing but if ive got generally clean watertype around i dont think id mind them pouring something into my hands for a quick drink itd be interesting for me if pokémon were real i think because id have around way more watertypes as long as they dont consider being a walking water fountain too much of an inconvenience
pokemon,not_removed,if it doesnt need that water to live sure
pokemon,not_removed,asking the real questions
pokemon,not_removed,this brings up another question that i thought of yesterday when watching an episode of the anime and saw a scene where ash gives his froakie some water to drink do water type pokemon need to drink water to survive even though they seem to be able to produce as much water as they want from their stomachs
pokemon,not_removed,thanks lanturn electrocuted
pokemon,not_removed,i feel like if i did this with a gyrados itd be the equivalent to me trying to get a drink from a fire hose
pokemon,not_removed,the last water type i took on my team was swanna so probably not because birds are actually kind of filthy maybe from my lapras though unless im dying in which case ill wring out a barboach if i have to
pokemon,not_removed,probably not a water gun or any high speed water attack soak or water sport no not that kind would do from what kind of water type something that isnt poisonous or slimy for sure but i think it would be safest to just freeze air and make ice cubes instead so anything that can learn an ice attack
pokemon,not_removed,some pokemon bend water instead of spilling it like water pulse in the anime so ill take that
pokemon,not_removed,if i found something like basil or herb could i make a cup of tea by using scald cause id do that in a heart beat
pokemon,not_removed,so you see the obvious answers in this thread drink from suicune dont drink from barboach and shellos but im here to ask a very important question would a slowbro be clean enough to drink its water
pokemon,not_removed,vaporeon is basically made of water wonder what happens if you just drink its body ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
pokemon,not_removed,i wouldnt but id suck the juice out of goomy
pokemon,not_removed,raticate used water gun edit for flare related question would you drink the berry juice from your shuckle
pokemon,not_removed,well yeah i mean it has to be pure as rain because they make it so it would be safe
pokemon,not_removed,yes i would totally drink the water from my qwilfish
pokemon,not_removed,let that squirtle squirt in you mouth
pokemon,not_removed,nah you use scald because the heat will kill the bacteria and follow it with icy wind to chill it
pokemon,not_removed,thinkd youd be fine downing a hydro cannon from your mega blastoise point blank
pokemon,not_removed,scald might be nice for a bath
pokemon,not_removed,i had to look up what is brine apparently its water with a lot of salt
pokemon,not_removed,genius
pokemon,not_removed,ashsgoomymattered
pokemon,not_removed,the thing with that would be how sure are you that the rain water isnt polluted youd need to build some sort of strainer using rocks and pebbles to sift stuff out of the water
pokemon,not_removed,barboarchlivesmatter you shit lord
pokemon,not_removed,milotic if miltank had scald it should be called pasteurize
pokemon,not_removed,i think horsea would be great for convenience small compact slow simple stream of water everything you need for a portable water fountain
pokemon,not_removed,it doesnt have to make sense
pokemon,not_removed,nah gyaradoss special attack is garbage more like trying to get a drink from a lazy river
pokemon,not_removed,i think it would be fine although i dont find many things disgusting i kiss my dog on the nose all the time i think you would just have to wait for him to tip his head up and stream the water for a few minutes first
pokemon,not_removed,we would drink miltanks milk so why not
pokemon,not_removed,i breed shuckles so i mean why not mid hatch run snack
pokemon,not_removed,you might get burned and slowed
pokemon,not_removed,that was the last time we saw stormychu
pokemon,not_removed,it might leave a burn its gotta be really fucking hot water like almost boiling ill pass on that unless we let the water sit for a long while
pokemon,not_removed,or tea
pokemon,not_removed,unless you live in an area with severe airborne pollutuon most rain isnt or is not after the first few minutes of rain flush out the pollutants
pokemon,not_removed,allpokelivesmatter
pokemon,not_removed,slow burn nice
pokemon,not_removed,legends say hes still drinking water to this very day
pokemon,not_removed,have a blastoise with scald coming out of one cannon and water gun from the other hot and cold running water get the temperature just to your liking
pokemon,not_removed,hmmokay then rain dance is a good answer then
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,the antigenwunners are more toxic than the genwunners could ever be and theres several times as many of them
pokemon,not_removed,i find the idea of a living creature succumbing to rust pretty fucking horrifying and i have the feeling game freak might think so too
pokemon,not_removed,stainless steel
pokemon,not_removed,i mean they would be rusting really damn fast if a little bit of rain is enough to cripple them
pokemon,not_removed,rusting is a very slow procedure if pokemon was scientifically accurate ice would be effective against fire water high pressure effective against grass and every being made of flesh and bones fire would burn most organic things
pokemon,not_removed,i find the idea of a living creature succumbing to rust pretty fucking existentially horrifying
pokemon,not_removed,if they did they wouldnt take a ability that makes steeltypes able to be poisoned and call it corrosion
pokemon,not_removed,well but all pokemon except firetype can be burned
pokemon,not_removed,if we follow the logic water should be super effective against steel types which is too much imo
pokemon,not_removed,your saves files are already on the game so you just have to keep the game and you are good to go
pokemon,not_removed,you can do a system transfer to a newer model as long as you wait to get rid of your after getting the new one
pokemon,not_removed,the save file is on the cart itself
pokemon,not_removed,wait do you have the actual physical games if so the saves are on the cart dlc and such is saved on the memory card in the system the way i read your original post made it sound like you had downloaded the games
pokemon,not_removed,strange my girlfriend says shes played my or she has as on her ds without overwriting my save maybe she just remembers incorrectly
pokemon,not_removed,thats what im trying to avoid if i can since i have a friend that wants my now and im not in any rush to buy the xl without sun and moon ill do it if i have to though
pokemon,not_removed,op might have digital copy but this is the reason i stick to physical copies
pokemon,not_removed,i do intend to keep the games themselves i just no longer want the itself i could have been more clear but yes i do have physical copies
pokemon,not_removed,you can start a new game but it wont let you save if theres already a save there
pokemon,not_removed,i can play my game of or on my girlfriend therefore the save file has to be on the game itself
pokemon,not_removed,alright thanks it was a while back so maybe she just remembers it wrong
pokemon,not_removed,i guess there is a reason to grind to poke finder
pokemon,not_removed,damn it the pokefinder grind is actually required for
pokemon,not_removed,dont normally do this but i think i want to give this a try the battle tree ones will no doubt be horrendous but ill just need to developfind some strategies
pokemon,not_removed,no stamp for battle royale ah well at least you get the idol pose
pokemon,not_removed,i dont have sun yet isnt the pokefinder just the camera that was used in the demo what kind of upgrades does that thing get
pokemon,not_removed,i only have the level version and so far the only upgrades were zoom and then a better zoom
pokemon,not_removed,first upgrade is zoom second is better zoom third is even better zoom fourth is summoning pokémon so you can take a better picture
pokemon,not_removed,could you explain the fourth one does that mean you can summon another pokemon in addition to the current pokemon so you can take a photo of two pokemons
pokemon,not_removed,now i havent seen how it works myself but i would assume that if for example the pokemon would have its back towards you youd be able to call out to it so that it turns around for a better photo
pokemon,not_removed,i am fairly certain that the ohko moves fail if the target is a higher level than the user
pokemon,not_removed,endeavor willowisp is the best method here because smeargle cant kill most with endeavor extreme speed of course its a moot point because smeargle cant survive two attacks from a anyway
pokemon,not_removed,anything with a focus sash endeavor and quick attack can oneshot anything not immune to normal type sturdy aron with a shell bell can actually heal back to full health after using endeavor then use another move to finish off the enemy
pokemon,not_removed,yeah that works except against pokemon with sturdy or a focus sash it works ok but usually smergle doesnt wanna be taking hits ever so pair it with spore or dark void i also think at one point articuno could learn some combo of moves with that effect
pokemon,not_removed,correct
pokemon,not_removed,with focus sash
pokemon,not_removed,you could increase the level to level or something with ivs and evs like special defense defense and speed
pokemon,not_removed,you need shell bell sandstorm sturdy and endeavor you heal back up with endeavor and shell bell and sandstorm kos the enemy
pokemon,not_removed,sand aron bell endeavor recovery saber because fear is for losers
pokemon,not_removed,probably why it doesnt have any priority moves at least not that i know of cool idea though
pokemon,not_removed,aron can nicely revengekill though with berry juicesturdy sandstorm and endeavour
pokemon,not_removed,tifu bc i never though or is a gameboy game
pokemon,not_removed,ive had this happen to me before its horrible worst thing is im pretty sure it was an employee at the movie theater i went to who ended up taking it since then ive gotten a bit paranoid i have a game i leave at home with a backup of everything with powersave now its worth it for the safety and i highly recommend getting one and a physical copy of the game to use it with anyway i wish you luck hope they call you with good news
pokemon,not_removed,just a bit confused what you mean what i meant about calling it a game boy is the i just still call it a gameboy if thats what you meant
pokemon,not_removed,yeah my mind is racing so much time out into my team im really hoping all works out sorry to hear of your experience i know im feeling paranoid and anxious right now
pokemon,not_removed,why
pokemon,not_removed,who cares
pokemon,not_removed,why do i call it a gameboy more or less because i had the og gameboy ive pretty much gotten all the handheld systems up to present and then they renamed it at some point and it wasnt the gameboy but it was you know
pokemon,not_removed,people that get confused when you refer to a as a gameboy theyre not in the same family of consoles
pokemon,not_removed,because everyone thinks youre talking about a gameboy
pokemon,not_removed,and im pretty sure most people here had the gameboy but refer to other consoles by their names its like calling windows dos or calling an imac an apple ii
pokemon,not_removed,downvoted for advertisement for youtube
pokemon,not_removed,i want one
pokemon,not_removed,how about say that instead of a picture of you staring at it with a link way to be vague and look like spam
pokemon,not_removed,i want one
pokemon,not_removed,awesome good to get info on this stuff i was actually thinking about making a post for people to post their teams and how far theyve gotten with the br and bt
pokemon,not_removed,good guide just want to add to clarify for the battle tree after you clear the first trainers on the regular difficulty you unlock the super version for me in super doubles i got bp per trainer for the first ten then every ten trainers will award more bp bp from bp from bp for etc
pokemon,not_removed,i did a monotype run with fairy and i didnt feel like breeding yet so i went with what i had for battle royal wasnt easy but i managed to beat master and get the idol battle style with a combination of mimikyu primarina and whimsicott
pokemon,not_removed,id like to see your movesets please thanks
pokemon,not_removed,cant wait to try this id love to see the moveset as well
pokemon,not_removed,havent you posted this twice before now im confused

pokemon,not_removed,was the first one removed did it say why it was removed if you didnt fix whatever the problem was from the first one i wouldnt be surprised about it continuing to be removed and if the first one is still around reposting the same information again is obviously unnecessary
pokemon,not_removed,the first one people could not view it i got a multitude of questions asking why it seemed only i could so i posted the second and that was reposted so i know why the second was but the first is still a mystery to me
pokemon,not_removed,metagross giant metal spidertank with an iq of that can fly anywhere and knows telekinesis sign me up he can kill all my enemies and do my math homework at the same time
pokemon,not_removed,lucarioriolu
pokemon,not_removed,sceptile
pokemon,not_removed,goodra
pokemon,not_removed,a tough decision i would say a gardevoir the ultimate protector my other choice would be mawile because holy moly mega mawile
pokemon,not_removed,mega alakazam ive been in love with alakazam and psychic pokemon since i was a kid when he got a mega i lost it
pokemon,not_removed,an eevee evolution of some kind usually ends up being glaceon espeon or umbreon
pokemon,not_removed,tropius can ride on it to fly around and unlimited bananas
pokemon,not_removed,charmeleon hands down always been my favey and im kinda a push over so i need that badass to always r there for me x
pokemon,not_removed,wowthis was hard for me to choose only pokemon to have by my sidei really sat here for a good minutes that pokemon ill want to be with me is gardevoir i was having trouble choosing from the other ones i love like leavanny gothitelle and mightyena
pokemon,not_removed,houndour theyve been my favorite ever since i saw it in gs which made me super angry that i couldnt get one until freaking kanto i absolutely love dogs im like the crazy dog lady haha but i also really like horror movies and things like stephen king for some reason when i saw houndour i thought of it as something out of a stephen king novel but i also just thought it looked adorable
pokemon,not_removed,latias i just really like it it would have been my first level when i was but my brother stole my game
pokemon,not_removed,eevee it has and always will be my favorite pokemon i would have my own eevee and never evolve it assuming we have items it will have a collar that will just be made out of everstones also it would likely wear my eevee hat just because besides the fact that i love eevee so much i feel like it would be a great companion if im bored or not feeling well edit alternatively smeargle that i will have sketch transform just so i can get around the rule of not picking ditto or mew with transform
pokemon,not_removed,arcanine probably for me foot tall fire dog that i could ride in lieu of a car other choice would be umbreon just because i love umbreon but its far less practical
pokemon,not_removed,a fing sableye
pokemon,not_removed,heracross mimikyu soon
pokemon,not_removed,ampharos great as a night light and can act as a generator when theres a power outage hed probably also make for a comfy sleeping partner
pokemon,not_removed,this is a nice thoughtprovoking question i think my pick would be crobat yes my name is weavile but i think crobat would prove to be an outstanding companion you already need to have a strong bond with it for it to evolve and i could see myself spending lots of time with a crobat in my neighborhood obviously id prefer a certain personality the same as choosing any friend i imagine he wouldnt be overly jolly and could just be around without needing to do anything in particular youve really helped me to think so thanks
pokemon,not_removed,riolu or rockruff gotta love the puppies
pokemon,not_removed,salamence
pokemon,not_removed,ive spent far too much time debating this and never come to a complete answer riolulucario as the protectorbest friend who i could talk to whenever and he reply espeon for the cuddles scizor because so fucking bad ass though with sumo on the horizon i might go with our lord and saviour rowlett because its a hootball
pokemon,not_removed,abomasnow so i will never be hot i hate summer and hot weather bleh love the cold and winter
pokemon,not_removed,latias its my favorite pokemon its a cool legendary it can mega evolve i can fly around on its back is highly intelligent and can understand human speech at least to a higher degree than other pokemon according to pokedex entries can communicate telepathically meaning i could essentially talk to it like a person and can go invisible
pokemon,not_removed,i will take ditto and copy everyone elses choices mwahahaha plus its cute with its derpy face
pokemon,not_removed,im a huge fan of dragons love charizard dragonite flygon and tons of others but honestly i think id have to go with mewtwo hes just such a beast
pokemon,not_removed,definitely teddiursa
pokemon,not_removed,id get ralts always cute and adorable
pokemon,not_removed,lapras
pokemon,not_removed,gliscor or giritina
pokemon,not_removed,rotom
pokemon,not_removed,this is tough as i love charizard lucario jolteon but i would have to go with keldeo i just love him
pokemon,not_removed,pichu because cute as heck and small enough so i could take it with me mostly anywhere
pokemon,not_removed,either noivern or yanma noivern would be awesome but yanma would be an adorable shoulderpercher like ashs pikachu its a tough choice
pokemon,not_removed,my loyal first level one hundred best partner ever poliwrath
pokemon,not_removed,it would have to be espeon because of its psychic powers it would be practical and it is damn cute
pokemon,not_removed,honchkrow man its not only a big cool bird but its a big cool mob boss bird and i dont think its weakness are very prominent in the real world so its not like itd be in much danger
pokemon,not_removed,celebi time travel
pokemon,not_removed,mega altaria for flying around with comfort
pokemon,not_removed,wow i have quite a lot of favourites so thisll be a tough one so i think ill go for sceptile honourable mentions to greninja and aegislash and heracross
pokemon,not_removed,volcarona i just love my giant fire moth
pokemon,not_removed,gengar
pokemon,not_removed,abra perfect mix of cool and cute most importantly it can teleport and commuting can eat a dick
pokemon,not_removed,snorlax that beautiful creature is essentially a portable bed
pokemon,not_removed,they can be legendaries mythical starters or just some other random and thus everyone chose arceus so they could then proceed to get everything
pokemon,not_removed,gardevoir of course she looks epic she got a lot of usefull moves like teleport i oculd go anywhere i just hope she wont use dream eater on me i and also blackholes
pokemon,not_removed,torterra id have my own private island
pokemon,not_removed,wooper thats my dude
pokemon,not_removed,mew
pokemon,not_removed,snorlax he would bankrupt me just trying to feed it but hed be worth it
pokemon,not_removed,abra with psychic reflect teleport and recover fuck walking literally everywhere and manageable outside the ball
pokemon,not_removed,an eevee the little thing would make an adorable pet
pokemon,not_removed,gallade
pokemon,not_removed,charizard my best friend stole my shiny trading card when i was ive never forgiven him he said he lost it but ive always know that thats a lie id like to go to his house in present day with my main man charizard look who i found and then burn all his possessions im not bitter
pokemon,not_removed,lucario
pokemon,not_removed,id have gengar gengar was the first pokemon i ever actually saw the first time i noticed pokemon was when my brother was watching that first anime episode my eyes focused on gengar and i automatically knew it would be my favorite gengar solidified my love of the ghost type and while my favorite is currently trevenant my traveling partner would be gengar itd be a good companion for me because im serious at times and he would get me to loosen up a bit life would be good with gengar as my friend
pokemon,not_removed,blaziken venusaur and gardevoir army absolute favorites i always try to find a place for them on my teams
pokemon,not_removed,toxicroak is my boi
pokemon,not_removed,arcanine loyal awesome giant dog that can breath fire and run at
pokemon,not_removed,i would have to choose braviary a loyal bird pokemon thats an absolute powerhouse buuuut scizor is a very close second
pokemon,not_removed,minunplusle or starmie
pokemon,not_removed,zygarde not only can i take him everywhere with me thanks to his many forms like in the anime but i feel hed be useful to have in my garden helping out and maybe scaring my neighbor into stop littering the street
pokemon,not_removed,azumarill
pokemon,not_removed,its got to be aggron he starts out as this small cute rock thing and then develops into such a bad ass like imagine you are about to get jumped in a dark alley and then aggron just heavy slams them against a wall it would be insane
pokemon,not_removed,muk its my favorite thats it really it would be too large for most indoor settings smell terrible and threaten to spread deadly toxins into every surface it came in contact with so it would be a huge pain in the ass really but i would still bring it along
pokemon,not_removed,sylveons wrap their ribbon feelers aroynd their trainers arm as they walk i always thought that was the sweetest thing ever i want my own cute fairy bunnyfox to cuddle
pokemon,not_removed,no ditto or mew zoroark lol but id probably pick espeon or umbreon
pokemon,not_removed,kingler hes a huge crab give him a knife come at me world
pokemon,not_removed,mareep or eevee they are just so cute and fluffy i would love to spoil them rotten
pokemon,not_removed,scizor starting scyther of course its my favorite and i love the steel types
pokemon,not_removed,i usually use an eevee evolved into whichever one the stats nature and ability point me towards for x i had an umbreon and as i used sylveon
pokemon,not_removed,arceus
pokemon,not_removed,dragonite no questions asked edit second choice would behmmreally tough call maybe ninetalesmaybe luxraymaybe ivysauror possibly flareon
pokemon,not_removed,super hard to answer out of the more than pokemon i would like as a partner i think id choose a shiny dragonite that i first received as an egg
pokemon,not_removed,arceus cause uh god
pokemon,not_removed,shiny mega rayquaza the most badass pokémon in history it can fly shoot lasers swim and rayquaza is the first pokémon i ever got to level
pokemon,not_removed,mudkip is just too cute the perfect snugglebuddy
pokemon,not_removed,either luxray or growlithe im such a sucker for dog pokemon and those two have always been my favorite if i absolutely had to pick one i would go with luxray because electric pokemon are my shiz
pokemon,not_removed,i want a parrot
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure the pokedex entries that say stuff about super iqs and other outrageous facts arent accurate
pokemon,not_removed,would you really want to hang out with something with an iq of its literally smarter than you you have like the intellect of an ant compared to it on that note it has literally incentive of being anyones trainer it should be focusing on things like world domination
pokemon,not_removed,there we go i would be stuck choosing between riolulucario the fennekin line and eeveesylveon it probably would be lucario who i would choose though
pokemon,not_removed,for me as well if i could only have one pokemon that would always have my back through every region and adventure id want it to be a lucario
pokemon,not_removed,oh man thats a good one lucario is so versatile too it would be very difficult for me to choose between him and mewtwo
pokemon,not_removed,them spoons
pokemon,not_removed,i love the eevelutions
pokemon,not_removed,the downside of espeonglaceon espeon using telekenisis to get whatever it wants whenever it wants and glaceon randomly freezing things the worst umbreon would probably so is just be a jerk
pokemon,not_removed,i love eeveevolutions and i definitely love umbreon but its also a very disappointing pokemon i wish it was better but it seems most dark pokemon that dont have a second typing arent that great
pokemon,not_removed,tropius is one of my favorite gen pokemon love him so much but man hes weak
pokemon,not_removed,i always name mine bananaman
pokemon,not_removed,oooh gardevoir is one of my favorite psychics
pokemon,not_removed,i remember when i first saw a hondour theyre bad ass
pokemon,not_removed,latias is one of my favorite legendaries
pokemon,not_removed,xd trickster but yeah eevee is high on my list of choices of pokemon i might want
pokemon,not_removed,im not positive how i helped you out but if i did then youre welcome
pokemon,not_removed,crobat isnt my top favorites but i still enjoy having him with me
pokemon,not_removed,its easier when told your top but when it can only be onetough choice
pokemon,not_removed,xd i specifically said not to cheat and pick everything by choosing ditto or mew with transform
pokemon,not_removed,charizard isnt a dragon lol
pokemon,not_removed,such a underdog i love him though
pokemon,not_removed,right
pokemon,not_removed,i totally agree
pokemon,not_removed,i dont want to be that guy but i think luxray is a lionlynx hybrid unless you are referring only too growlithe then ignore me good taste tho p
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure pokedex entries are actually written by year olds sent out to find and train pokemon so visually descriptive they may be accurate but historically or scientifically probably shotty probably bed time stories and information gleaned from ricky down the street who tends to fib a fair bit
pokemon,not_removed,only to be stopped by those meddling alakazam and their iq
pokemon,not_removed,you could get the cute little riolu then after being so happy with you watch him evolve into a badass fighter d
pokemon,not_removed,something about always having a utensil for ice cream is a real bonus
pokemon,not_removed,a tremendous jerk that is hard to kill and can just let the opponent die via toxic and confuse ray
pokemon,not_removed,i enjoy her flavor text in the pokedex plus shes a good attacker all of the pokemon i love is because of two things their looks and their flavor text dont care how well they do in battle really
pokemon,not_removed,it is my favorite legendary i actually have a shiny one in my omega ruby
pokemon,not_removed,shoot i cant read completely missed the last part sorry op
pokemon,not_removed,lol you know what i mean dragon looking pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,then its super badass and can protect me im a tiny girl and i wanna be able to walk around at night my sylveon could hold my arm as we walk home and it would be great i could also sew it ribbon covers for the winter it gets cold here i think my rabbits would love my sylveon too
pokemon,not_removed,every time i see alakazam i gotta make a food joke xd
pokemon,not_removed,im so jealous i spent months soft resetting in as for a shiny latias to name hylia
pokemon,not_removed,xd no worries
pokemon,not_removed,yeah it could protect you sylveon is one of the strongest pokemon on my team in x people dont tend to give it enough credit sure its cute and cuddly and pink but that thing packs a punch
pokemon,not_removed,i did run aways for it when i got the eon ticket took about a week named it kula it can mean gold in hawaiian she was my first shiny legendary seemed fitting since she is my favorite legendary
pokemon,not_removed,itll wreck the shit out of any mofo that tries to attack us then well go home for cuddles and tv
pokemon,not_removed,cool name going to be extra relevant come january lol
pokemon,not_removed,lol oh yeah didnt think about that 😆
pokemon,not_removed,i would take away slowbro since you have alazkazam and dewgong and either add an arcanine or rapidash for a fire type
pokemon,not_removed,i assume youre playing red or yellow
pokemon,not_removed,get rid of dragon rage on dragonite its an awful move honestly with the wrap mechanics wrap and thunder wave are a better combo also you dont need slam you already have hyper beam add a coverage move dragonite has plenty of those add coverage on your alakazam you dont need reflect just get rid of psybeam too and add some coverage dont worry about the people saying too many psychic types are bad you could probably win the whole thing with only psychic types because they are broken af get amnesia on your slowbro get rid of strength and confusion you already have psychic so add a coverage move and why not surf over water gun id suggest chansey and tauros for your last two slots as they are of the strongest pokemon gen had tauros is considered the strongest bar mewtwo and mew finally consider a sleeper as sleep is a pretty strong mechanic over dewgong which honestly isnt very good exeggutor and venusaur are both great sleepers and exeggutor has explosion as well as psychic moves to make strong while venusaur has the edge on speed and guaranteed crit razor leaf if you dont like what i suggested snorlax and gengar are good dont go for scyther or arcanine because while they look cool they dont have many good moves to use in gen games
pokemon,not_removed,one more comment here i think itd be more fun and add more variety if you allowed legends but banned mew and mewtwo as the legendary birds arent op zapdos is good but articuno is mediocre at bestoutclassed completely by lapras and jynx as an ice type and moltres while being the best fire type is still plagued by the fire type pokemons common drawback lack of a movepool outside of fire moves most fire type mons are forced to rely on fire spin due to trapping mechanics byt because fire types are generally not very defensive and none get thunder wave iirc theyre outclassed at this too zapdos is far and away the best of the three but still doesnt crack the top which are tauros snorlax chansey alakazam and exeggutor
pokemon,not_removed,you need to balance out your team two psychic types opens for weakness i recommend adding gengar and a pokemon that is good against bug types just to cover that possible weakness
pokemon,not_removed,i saw some coments on team balance already so im focussing on move sets slowbro water gun is too weakuse surf insteadyou dont really need psychic moves on one pokemon for a imouse one slot for more typecover like ice beam for a grass type switching in moves of the same typehyperbeam i guess is good to take down a bulky pokemon but losing a turn is a bit too muchyou can take substitute there so you can sweep you dont have a fire type so take for dragon rage alakazam i guess you could change psybeam for toxic but i dont know much about alakazams move pool dewgongi actually like this setif you see that you are short in dmg you can use blizzard is just my oppinion it isnt by any means a correction for your team if i made some gramatical mistakes d
pokemon,not_removed,slowbro is wayyy better than dewgong and fire types are pretty ass in gen psychic types are blatantly op as thier weaknesses basically dont exist fire types are piss poor types and have no movepool whatsoever go for a normal type chansey taurossnorlax should make up a core
pokemon,not_removed,sorry for the late reply but i have red with all pokemon but weepinbeel evolution meowth evolution and the mt moon resurected pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,thats what gen means also blue and possibly green
pokemon,not_removed,in gen you dont need to worry about psychic types having a weakness bug is totally useless and psychic is immune to ghost attacks only lick and nightshade anyway lol and to add insult to injury all ghosts are part poison basically psychic types in first gen were stupidly ridiculously overpowered both because of this and because of the lack of special split giving most of them horrendously high effective stat totals which is why gen mewtwo is the most powerful pokemon that will ever exist in its own meta get yourself a tauros or snorlax normal types are great in rby probably dont need two water types either way arcanine is fun maybe look at something like dugtrio for fun with the broken crits system
pokemon,not_removed,gen u dont need to get rid of psychic types in fact id add more it doesnt matter psychic and normal are hands down the best types in the gen games good bug types are nonexistent in gen try to name one strong bug type attack in gen this is also why grass types are so good too no strong poison flying or bug attacks and resistances to of the most common attacking types makes grass types imo the best type only weak to ice and fire in essence and fire types are pretty bad too so they arent even seen
pokemon,not_removed,in gen hyper beam is actually really good because if it koes a pokemon you dont have to recharge iirc
pokemon,not_removed,add fishlax for sure httpwwwsmogoncomdexrbpokemonsnorlax and definitely tauros httpwwwsmogoncomdexrbpokemontauros
pokemon,not_removed,but which one
pokemon,not_removed,why does it matter
pokemon,not_removed,because it determines which pokemon are available to you for example you cant get scyther or arcanine if youre playing blue
pokemon,not_removed,yes you can its called trading if hes baytling with a friend id assume he has that capability
pokemon,not_removed,why would he ask to trade right before a battle
pokemon,not_removed,im saying he obviously has the ability to trade so he could have already traded with other people is this concept that complicated
pokemon,not_removed,how do you know his friend has the other version let alone the fact that if one of possibly their only two games is yellow its guaranteed that some are going to be offlimits
pokemon,not_removed,he didnt mention anything about not having access to version exclusives he merely asked for suggestions he can have other friends it might not be just this guy whos his only friend with pokemon jeez dude
pokemon,not_removed,i just thought he wanted to know so he wasnt hunting for a pokemon he couldnt possibly obtain ¯ツ¯
pokemon,not_removed,i think you were trying to make this ¯ツ¯ type it like this ¯ツ¯ i am a bot visit rarmfixerbot for more info
pokemon,not_removed,haha ditto oddish is basically what regular oddish already looks like cool planters
pokemon,not_removed,hehe thanks the fake one was my idea as was the existence of ditto oddish c
pokemon,not_removed,well in the alola dex they still count as different forms hope this will be fixed soon and not become a new standard i still havent got over the fact that different genders are no longer treated as different forms for those without a gender difference
pokemon,not_removed,i noticed that too whats interesting is that the gender differences do still exist but the dex just doesnt acknowledge them its interesting that this oversight occurs just now since this isnt the first time pokemon with gender differences gained a new form mega evolution
pokemon,not_removed,i miss the ingame national dex so much it didnt have these sorts of problems
pokemon,not_removed,everything about this is a buggy mess lots of legal things getting blocked as hacks the buggy gen conversion and now this
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i really hope theyll fix this soon
pokemon,not_removed,well to be fair gen is an incredibly buggy game
pokemon,not_removed,the name thing isnt because is glitchy its because the transporters glitch check is messing up
pokemon,not_removed,but if column a bit of column b as far as i know the name thing happens when glitches pokémon are being transferred
pokemon,not_removed,this is disturbing
pokemon,not_removed,source its oc and this is my instagram
pokemon,not_removed,thank you so much
pokemon,not_removed,im capturing legendariesubstapus first then ill probably start going island by island
pokemon,not_removed,eleven pokemon to go only one i dont have the prevo of can obtain looking at you tapu lele and fini is lunaala
pokemon,not_removed,my dex is about complete
pokemon,not_removed,not good was only really catching new pokemon since ive planned to ultimately transfer most of the prior ones from oras breedingsoftresetting has worn me down so i got a pheromosa and tapu lele then got burned out and lost most of my drive im stepping away for the moment
pokemon,not_removed,im not gonna bother with it till the bank update is live thats where the majority of my pokedex entries will come
pokemon,not_removed,im only doing the new pokemon and the alolan forms i have silvally cosmog and cosmoem to go the rest will come from the bank
pokemon,not_removed,alola melemele akala ulaula poni im currently trying to masuda method for a shiny rockruff after i get that ill focus more on completing the pokedex as well as getting all of the gen pokemon for my living pokedex
pokemon,not_removed,that may be considered a spoiler for people who dont know you can catch either
pokemon,not_removed,i have an extra lunala if youd like
pokemon,not_removed,eh catching the tapus shouldnt really be considered a spoiler at all i can understand the ubs though
pokemon,not_removed,this would make a fantastic tattoo
pokemon,not_removed,lovely artwork you have it made into a teddy bear
pokemon,not_removed,i think ashgreninja is an anime exclusive thing if it is in the main games i wouldnt mind but honestly i dont see there any reason for it to be in the games we didnt get the crystal onix pink butterfree and whatever else is an anime exclusive thing
pokemon,not_removed,i mean its basically just an anime exclusive mega evolution i dont see why its even worth bringing into the games
pokemon,not_removed,cant the anime have its own thing unrelated to the games it is its own thing its hyping up the anime it doesnt need to lead to anything in game
pokemon,not_removed,i wouldnt mind if its in the games so long as it doesnt get stuck to one game like those two pichu from fourth gen were and cosplay pikachu is going to be seriously that kind of thing is so stupid
pokemon,not_removed,i think they wanted to give ash a mega and showcase a gen starter like they usually do but since they havent come up with the megas for the gen starters ashgreninja was used instead i guess im in the minority but i like it
pokemon,not_removed,the focus on it wont be a copout of they dont work it into the games it helps the anime stand as a separate entity from the games the reason it exists is to develop ashs character and give him a pokemon with the power of a mega its proving its need to exist in the anime there is no need for it or its concept to be added to the games since its concept is rooted in mega evolution
pokemon,not_removed,this will never show up in the games it would require them to design new models for pokemon not just one new model two models for the male and female character if they kept it simpleand lazy it will only be available for a few pokemon most likely starters plus there are a lot of pokemon people like more than starter that already have megas which i think was one of the reasons behind megas to begin with make popular pokemon stronger and cooler
pokemon,not_removed,i hope the form concepts in the games because ill be a bit annoyed if its not but i think even if it isnt it makes sense why he isnt getting a regular mega greninja is supposedly tied to the kalos disaster and somehow it will be important in stopping team flare and giving it its own form allows it to stand out and be the hero greninja instead of just a regular mega greninja which is why they gave it to ash so he could stand out with his own form and greninja would play a role in ending the crisis so im pretty sure it will make sense soon if its anime exclusive honestly i feel like giving ash something different from a mega actually got more peoples attention and makes him different from everybody else so if anything it might be better for ash than a mega anyway
pokemon,not_removed,im sure its just for the anime
pokemon,not_removed,i hope its just a new mechanism to achieve a mega evolution that stays anime exclusive and that in the games greninja will receive this as its mega along with the other gen starters but will need mega stones as is tradition in the games
pokemon,not_removed,i personally doubt it holds any significance outside of the anime it seems more of a copout to give greninja some value int he anime while also giving ash a pokemon that can essentially mega evolve honestly i hope it is an anime only form or the whole point of it being an extremely rare thing is ruined
pokemon,not_removed,now i cant tell if people either dont believe it could happen or dont want to believe it could happen or both
pokemon,not_removed,i think it will be in the game just like azs floette and just be a boosted one maybe a mega to balance the existence of it but i feel it will be in even if hidden in the data but im for sure zygarde forms is gonna be in the game since they are in every current side game atm other then comastet
pokemon,not_removed,i think that it could be included i mean with pokemon amie it could be a requirement at full hearts you pokemon even breathes in sync with you maybe thats why they introduced it in the first place also with seeing the character models in battles it could be that we see the characters mimicking the pokémons movement
pokemon,not_removed,i hope not its just a dumb idea imo
pokemon,not_removed,i desperately want it to hold some relevance or i will be forever salty that satoshiash didnt end up with mega charizard y i mean seriously its not like charizard is one of his most iconic pokemon or anything like that they didnt want to give him an actual mega evolution though because continuity if he got a mega in this region dont you think it would be a little weird when he didnt take it to alola with him honestly though i think the idea of fusing with your pokemon may have relevance in sunmoon a la pokemon reburst people have noticed the symbols in the japanese logos look a lot like the crystal in reburst
pokemon,not_removed,no i think ash greninja is dumb
pokemon,not_removed,i just think that ash couldve just gotten a mega rather than them making something up plus not a hundred percent on this but i feel like this sharing pain thing has been done too many time in anime but thats speculation on my end
pokemon,not_removed,i would say the main difference between this example and those you listed in your post is that ashgreninja has been a recurringbuilt upprolonged thing while crystal onix received one episode pink butterfree received one episode etc im not saying ashgreninja shouldnt stay anime exclusive but those three examples arent really even
pokemon,not_removed,i mostly mean his form of transformation in general the whole synchronizing thing i know ashgreninja himself is an anime exclusive thing but his transformation is what has me asking
pokemon,not_removed,well think of it like this nobody thought that mega mewtwo was anything else but a new forme yet it was revealed that mega evolution was a thing
pokemon,not_removed,not unless it fully explains why its anime exclusive why it exclusive through lore the anime at least does that but its never been touched upon which is the real headscratcher and like i said we have good writers so im sure they know what theyre doing in how their setting this up
pokemon,not_removed,couldnt have they just used charizard or many of his other pokemon for his mega in that case and greninja is gen
pokemon,not_removed,the anime already stood as its own entity no need to confirm it further i say a copout because for some reason they couldnt have given ash a regular mega when every other character does it makes little to no sense which is why i say theres probably something more to it im surprised that so many people want to deny that its a possibility
pokemon,not_removed,it is simple since when was mawile bedrill audino and abomasnow popular
pokemon,not_removed,its not that much work depending on exactly how much changes models can easily be manipulated and most of the changes with ashgreninja are colour swaps which is no different than including variables for shiny pokemon and takes up very little memory considering they made and fully animated over pokemon for the battles and in amie for gen there should be plenty of time for the developers to work on something like this none of the current pokemon need to be redone its literally the first time they havent had to redraw everything from scratch thanks to the existance of the models i would guess that if it is a feature the pokemon will just take whatever colours of clothing youre wearing maybe part of the head will change slightly depending on your gender too but i fully believe that this is exactly why we can now see our trainers during the battle maybe it wont be a feature for every pokemon but it could at least be used for many of the new ones which theyve said they dont want to give megas to yet
pokemon,not_removed,dont you think its kind of underdesigned for a regular mega and itd be kinda weird that they would design it after ash
pokemon,not_removed,plus it being integrated into the games effectively makes the general public think the animeall of pokemon and not just one part of it
pokemon,not_removed,maybe it will be like the floette and be called eternal greninja instead
pokemon,not_removed,dumb because its not a mega or because its not a complete change
pokemon,not_removed,the same can be said with ashgreninja himself that he will most likely not come with him to alola
pokemon,not_removed,there is literally no reason theyd pick a mechanic out of a manga that is both japan only and failed miserably fusions a la reburst will not happen if gamefreak actually values the things their fans like and the shape of the crystal is in no way evidence supporting it
pokemon,not_removed,oh whys that
pokemon,not_removed,really the only thing about ashgreninja that differentiates it from megas is the fact that it changes to look like its trainer it likely isnt even as strong as a mega evolution and you cant use the anime as an example for it since the battles in the anime take actual skill and levels and strength barely seem to be a real factor at all with strength mainly being used as a comical setup or used to show how underpowered a character is if ashgreninja does end up in the main series games at some point itll probably be forced as a mega evolution that has a different theme for how it changes compared to other megas considering the reason megas can happen is because of the bond between trainer and pokemon the main thing that allows ashgreninja to happen as well
pokemon,not_removed,not only that but it was one of two pokemon to get two different mega evolutions
pokemon,not_removed,well the series isnt over yet is it i wouldnt go as far as calling the writers good considering how bad it is of an anime but they seem to be setting it up all in good time
pokemon,not_removed,i meant the current gen so not charizard is gen and if they use him then thats less gen pokemon for them to show case i dont think ash has ever carried a previous gen pokemon for the long term in a current series and i think thats because a purpose of the anime is to showcase the new pokemon for the current games
pokemon,not_removed,it did no argument there but this helps it to stand on its own even further if they brought it to the games it may even just bring the two closer to being the same thing obviously we would know they arent but the general public would i think its to showcase how strong of a bond he has with his pokemon and because no generation pokemon has a mega they didnt want ash to get an old pokemon to mega evolve since they want to promote the newer ones and greninja was already popular with his hidden ability and smash bros so it made sense to give him a cool animeexclusive form to get more people interested in the anime and the pokemon sure they could have brought back charizard sceptile heracross or glalie to mega evolve when i saw the poster for xyz i thought the sceptile on it was ashs at first but that would have taken away from developing greninjas character and ashs character due to it and taken away from some of its marketing it is certainly possible they could bring it to the main games but i wouldnt say its as certain as people think
pokemon,not_removed,extra game models adds a lot of extra work and ti competes with an existing game mechanic that does the same thing and is easier to explain mawili got a mega because it is only found in or and its as counter part is sableye which is used by one of the elite four phoebe and they wanted to give her a mega for the rematch that is a stable of her team beedrill because someone had a cool idea for a mega audino no idea maybe game freak wanted troll us i like abomasnow im glad they gave a mega to a very angry fluffy snowman
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think its under designed at all mega kangaskhan has no change at all really and megas like venusaur charizard y gardevior and absol show about the same amount of change that ash greninja shows
pokemon,not_removed,i dont really know what it is its just weird to me and i would hate it in the games
pokemon,not_removed,fairly certain at least part of reburst was localized and dude its just a theory relax
pokemon,not_removed,actually there are tons of differences with it and regular megas its actually shown to be stronger than mega evolution cause it near defeated dianthas mega gardevoir ash shares greninjas sight and pain he can communicate with him mentally and both mimic each others movements other than those yes it requires a strong bond but pokemon in general is mostly about strong bonds
pokemon,not_removed,you do know many seasons get different writers right its the same ones since the first season
pokemon,not_removed,charizard came back and stayed for black and white while at the same time giving focus to his other pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,but all that marketing and showcasing will be gone once greninja leaves and that also leaves ash with no mega once again you think theyll repeat the same process over and over while keeping people interested when theres an obvious way to solve it its reall counter productive like notchedear pichu
pokemon,not_removed,it wouldnt be whole new model itd be like how you ad armor to your character in skyrim base body stays the same but new elements on it you see games do it all the time also isnt what you said just now contradict that they only give megas to popular pokemon like you said and mawile was one of the first megas ever introduced it didnt just show up in or
pokemon,not_removed,theres an interview on the official pokemon website where the developers explain which pokemon are chosen for mega evolution and it basically came down to two reasons popular pokemon that can get cool new forms this way lesser used pokemon that can get a significant boost from a new form
pokemon,not_removed,hair on the side of his face and a belly pattern is the same amount
pokemon,not_removed,dont like the idea that you pokemon would take a slight resemblance of you huh
pokemon,not_removed,not officially i dont think only fan translations
pokemon,not_removed,anime strength is a joke honestly if a pokemon isnt completely overpowering everything around it its either on par or completely underpowered compared to everything around it the anime relies on skill more than actual strength
pokemon,not_removed,i am aware but that doesnt excuse it from being a manufactured and extremely procedural show with a bad case of stagnation they may have new writers but its still the same old antics and same old gags with a fresh coat of paint flashier animations new characters etc
pokemon,not_removed,wasnt that just for a few episodes i didnt really watch bw so i cant say for sure
pokemon,not_removed,theyll change marketing to a new pokemon for alola like they do every generation zoroark and zekrom were heavily pushed in blackwhite years and now we barely see anything from them even though lucario is still relevant popular and marketed his big push for marketing has gone down since generation ended there are exceptions of course like pikachu charizard mewtwo and lucario but for the most part marketing is generational ash doesnt need to have a mega in alola theres no stipulation saying he needs one even if there was who says greninja wont continue to be his mega i doubt theyll repeat a plot similar to ashgreninja over and over theyll find something new to do
pokemon,not_removed,that is still more work because in skyrim armor scale based on the body size that are pretty much the same thing in pokemon we got models a lot are similar game freak is most likely making new models for a lot of pokemon for sm this still requires them to got through and make sure it looks and works properly also im sure people want a trainercharizard too bad because he already has two megas we just got mega evolution and im sure it took people awhile to get used to that mechanic lets not introduce another that people clearly dont want mega evolution is already now written into the current universe unless they want create a different universe to explain why this form of evolution didnt exist before again a lot of pokemon that came from gen got megas it could have been them hinting at the oras release
pokemon,not_removed,venusaur getting a flower on its head and more leafs charizard getting plumes on its head and elbows gardevior getting a wider dress absol getting wings babykhan coming out of the pouch yeah i think greninja getting black cheekears red plume leaner frame and a water shuriken x on its back is sufficient as far as the more conservative mega redesigns have gone
pokemon,not_removed,no lol i just think its weird and cheesy and wouldnt work in the games
pokemon,not_removed,ah okay
pokemon,not_removed,youre right i which case it was both
pokemon,not_removed,you gave up watching it a while ago didnt you cause that isnt the case this time
pokemon,not_removed,nope it was for the rest of the black and white series
pokemon,not_removed,mega evolution so far seems to be something everyone can do so theres bound to be more trainers that will found out can do it too so if ash is to catch up he kinda does need a mega and if greninja is his main mega for now on that would mean he would either have keep calling to bring him over to battle a mega trainer just to send him back when its over or keep greninja with him for now on thus losing some focus on the new gen pokemon for one that already has plenty of focus
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure were keeping regular megas as well so charizard or any other existing megas dont need it and they dont have to do this with all existing pokemon just a hanful plus its not like people wanted mega evolutions to happen to begin with either people to this day still dont like it but gf went with it anyway gf have been planning this game for a long while now so they had plenty of time to work this out if they did
pokemon,not_removed,well the water shuriken is greninjas natural ability so its not exactly a change but those changes you described at least make the pokemon look like they have significantly changed even if its a little like how venusaur becomes a lighter pigment or how charizard becomes black and has a different wing formation greninja practically like people joke sometimes cosplayed ash
pokemon,not_removed,well your reasons as to why is not explained well but everyone has their own opinion so i wont press further
pokemon,not_removed,then again you cant measure a pokemon being able to beat another pokemon as stronger than mega evolution without seeing where the stats from the change went to if it doesnt have any more than extra stat points it isnt actually any stronger than a mega evolution
pokemon,not_removed,ive loosely followed it just isnt for me anymore its the same old antics and gags just now they added a little bit of a crush from one character nothings that different
pokemon,not_removed,hmm i just looked it up and he was added at the back end of the series total so its not like charizard was a main focus of the series anyway if they wanted one of his older pokemon to be a mega it would need to be the main focus of xyxyz and i guess they didnt want that most of the dumb shit in the anime can usually be explained by the anime being a way to showcasemarket the games ie ash losing every league so he can go to the next region resetting his team etc
pokemon,not_removed,thats true and it is possible he will keep greninja or send him with oak though sending him to oak would make the most sense so they can focus on developing alola pokemon we have no idea until it happens maybe hell even lose the transformation using it to save kalos or something which would be a huge copout but i digress its anyones guess were not even sure if mega evolution will be a major plot point in the alola region
pokemon,not_removed,as far as charizard i was speaking about charizard y not x which is a significant change
pokemon,not_removed,how bout we put it into an estimate dianthas gardevoir is level in the games translated into the anime as really frickin strong to the it is near untouchable because its very fast now greninja got this new form the moment it evolved from forgadier which means itd be level translated to the anime as pretty good but still got ways to go to be real storng now it battled gardevoir and was losing of course but when it transformed it drove gardevoir into a corner forcing diantha to mega evolve to even the playing field now mgardevoirs power in the games would be much much higher than greninjas even if it got a stat boost at that point in other words greninja shouldve been completely outmatched here but when its form was temporarily perfected it then over powered gardevoir and almost knocked her out with one hit take note the greninja only got maybe or hits in including that one one more probably wouldve won him the battle until he became unconcious now for it to trump gardevoir it would mean that its attack and speed stats wouldve gone way past the to do so much damage to her at its level and even overpowered one of her attacks at full force so if i were to guess greninjas boost would be extra stats to catch up as it did or translated to the anime pretty frickin strong and if it gained stats than it really is stronger than mega evolution
pokemon,not_removed,oh dude you missed out on a lot even though you loosely followed actual character devolpment for ash as well as great characterization for his pokemon and friends serena best girl by far and a pretty cool story behind it as well cant say its the same old thing if you dont really watch it
pokemon,not_removed,so what does that say about ashgreninja if the anime its to market the games
pokemon,not_removed,remember though the point at which pokemon evolve in the anime doesnt equal any known level in the games some examples pokemon learn moves at a different rate than the games if dawn for example obtained piplup at level as a starter like the games then there would have only been a couple of ways piplup could have knew bide already either it would have had to be bred on to it or it was a higher level than the point it would evolve another case any pokemon that ash got that didnt evolve yet squirtle and totodile both been through many battles but neither have evolved look at how long it took cyndaquil or phany to evolve
pokemon,not_removed,each episode is the same featured pokemon of the day ash battles someone rocket shows up serena gets blushy lather rinse repeat all the tropes are there too ash gets a powerful pokemon releases it the female protagonist pursues something superficial and glitzy ash rematches a gym leader once or twice for dramatic effect side characters have their annoying catchphrases all tied up with the loose plot goal of i wanna be the best and travel with my friends who ill probably abandon next season
pokemon,not_removed,it show cases a gen pokemon in the xy games and gives ash a mega none of the megas are from gen so they just picked a pokemon that they could create a cool mega evolution for i heard greninja is extremely popular so it makes sense why it was chosen
pokemon,not_removed,most of those you just said are not correct serena doesnt get blushy that much goodra was not released this will be ashs only second rematch serenas arc is done and surprisingly team rocket hasnt interfered as much
pokemon,not_removed,why not just give greninja a regular mega instead of this variation im if they could make this up the could make up a regular mega greninja
pokemon,not_removed,goodra wasnt in the show since ash made the decision to let it stay in the marshland at first this seemed permanent until we found out that ash wasnt gonna be catching another pokemon now it seems like hes going to make history return for a pokemon that he gave up so it could be happy of course this also goes to prove that ash has grown as a character and no longer forgets to return his promise of seeing them again
pokemon,not_removed,i knew gf wanted to make team skull popular with all their selfreferential humor and wacky attitudes but i wasnt expecting them to use them as marketing in a commercial praise arceus
pokemon,not_removed,wanna see what fast looks like here it is in human formits ya boi boltzma
pokemon,not_removed,worlds fastest runner repping the franchises slowest generation the irony makes this all the better
pokemon,not_removed,i imagine hes a man who likes to go fast so heres his team deoxyss ninjask megaalakazam or aerodactyl theyre tied for fastest mega accelgor electrode and one of the base speed mons mewtwo aerodactyl jolteon and crobat id go with jolteon because of the whole bolt thing or half his team could be deoxys forms and the other half could be megas and ninjask but i balanced it out
pokemon,not_removed,i love the grunt animations i want them in the game now
pokemon,not_removed,what if bolt is so fast because he is holding a choice scarf
pokemon,not_removed,usain bolt use extreme speed its super effective
pokemon,not_removed,hahaha oh wow
pokemon,not_removed,i wonder if he can outrun pheromosa
pokemon,not_removed,slowest did you play any of gen
pokemon,not_removed,wait this isnt for gen iv
pokemon,not_removed,throw some choice scarfs and quick claws in too
pokemon,not_removed,mega aerodactyl all the way man the eyebrow wyvern rules all
pokemon,not_removed,you left out the second fastest pokemon not counting forms
pokemon,not_removed,wheres pheromosa though
pokemon,not_removed,whats his bp in speed we already know he has a iv and ev in speed
pokemon,not_removed,i think they were referencing the stats of gen vii pokemon not the game itself p
pokemon,not_removed,and every one has to have at least one priority move
pokemon,not_removed,now i cant help but think that all the people at the olympics have a perfect iv and nature that furthers said iv and they ev trained their entire life on that ev and then you have all the normal people like me with random ivs and quriky nature so i dont excel in anything and have just been randomly distributing evs my whole life
pokemon,not_removed,maybe not iv but dev perfect ev
pokemon,not_removed,id suggest giving the machamp line some kind of type change i feel its rather arbitrary to just have an cosmetic change but then again its a fan project so its up to you
pokemon,not_removed,dat machamp
pokemon,not_removed,machamp just makes me uncomfortable
pokemon,not_removed,sees machamp whoops there go my pants
pokemon,not_removed,i really like these swellow is definitely my favourite one there great work
pokemon,not_removed,machop and dale dancers
pokemon,not_removed,fightingfairy for sure
pokemon,not_removed,hmm maybe im doing a plethora of variants but some of them are not going to get a typing change for different reasons such as no current typings being suitable for the design changes or being redundant for example i couldve made machamp fightingfairy that sounds like such a bizarre duo typing for him but i already have so many fairy types it seems that its apropos to nothing to just give them a random new look but they make sense in the settingstory i suppose i usually design pokemon around a type or at least with one in mind and not just a random concept but machokes line was just too fun d
pokemon,not_removed,id love for him to be my ride pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,thank you so much that means a lot
pokemon,not_removed,yeah thats the inspiration
pokemon,not_removed,are you meeting with the move set at all
pokemon,not_removed,using machamp to hatch my eggs also that swellow is snazzy
pokemon,not_removed,can you elaborate a little bit u
pokemon,not_removed,i think he means like having different moves than the regular kanto machamp line
pokemon,not_removed,ooohhhh in that case yes
pokemon,not_removed,oh and i have a little question of my own is this machamp line variant still physically oriented like the normal one or is it more focused on special attacks
pokemon,not_removed,still physically specialized d if i stick with the fightingfairy typing hell get some nice physical fairy moves that will be shared with some of the other fakemon including a grassfairy starter and a dragonfairy pseudo legendary
pokemon,not_removed,why yall gotta do a cool pose i just wanna take a nap and everyones gotta do a cool pose around me
pokemon,not_removed,your style continues to impress i look forward each morning to see your work would love to have you maybe do a commission piece some day
pokemon,not_removed,it wasnt me that did it it was uocastrballz
pokemon,not_removed,ooops meant to comment and not reply sorry
pokemon,not_removed,multiply the encounter rate by the shiny chance that is your literal chance aka really really lucky
pokemon,not_removed,you make me sick you happiness and shiny haver
pokemon,not_removed,i found sandile on the and trumbeak well about minutes ago dumb luck ftw
pokemon,not_removed,im so sorry
pokemon,not_removed,ive been playing pokemon ever since i can remember first game was gold i only have shinies of them were from omega ruby from y
pokemon,not_removed,i kid you not an hour or two after this post i found a shiny cutiefly through sos chaining thanks for your good luck
pokemon,not_removed,my first game was platinum and sun and moon is the only games that ive caught more than one shiny on my own
pokemon,not_removed,no problem fam luck of the irish amirite
pokemon,not_removed,from pgl article on it but if million trades are registered then the reward will also include a friend ball we gotta haul ass
pokemon,not_removed,guys dont forget you need to talk to the before and at the end of the event to guarantee your trades get counted
pokemon,not_removed,a brief word of advice dont take the first magnemite you see of the time itll be gone take one a few spots down to make sure no ones magnemite gets lost in the sea of magnets
pokemon,not_removed,let the magnemite coil commence
pokemon,not_removed,pgl members who gtstrade or more times will also earn rare candies neat im going in on this mission i have way too many breedjects to get rid of i even stored a level gts fortune for this opportunity
pokemon,not_removed,the goals only a million pokemon we cant possibly fail this right
pokemon,not_removed,magnet has been unleashed on the world hope my beast ball magnemite eventually ends in the hand of someone who wants it
pokemon,not_removed,i caught some magnemites on my copy of yellow earlier today for just this purpose named them all rpokemon as well and poke transported them to sun
pokemon,not_removed,コイル intensifies
pokemon,not_removed,if you sign up to the pgl and record trades you get rare candies so go sign up to the pgl for around bp worth of items
pokemon,not_removed,so many magnemite trades in gts but so many this pokémon has already been traded slow down people let me participate
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,magnemite art dude should reference this
pokemon,not_removed,im going to breed some modest beast ball magnemites named tekketsu iron blooded with the ot jobert and trainer id if you receive one please reply or pm me
pokemon,not_removed,dont forget to periodically talk to your trading partner inside the castle for a few extra fc especially if you have the fortune teller buff for the gts
pokemon,not_removed,this pokémon has already been traded
pokemon,not_removed,lets hope that we mite complete this ill just stop
pokemon,not_removed,go magnemites go
pokemon,not_removed,operation magnemite
pokemon,not_removed,on the one hand this is a good way to organize things and ensure we complete lots of trades on the other hand im finding it impossible to actually give a magnemite in trade for another magnemite someone else put up because people are trading them so fast i keep getting this pokemon has already been traded errors at least the magnemites i put up myself get traded within seconds ill just stick to that i think
pokemon,not_removed,dont forget to go to the castle before you go to the gts every time you make a trade drop out of the gts and talk to the npc of the person you just traded with for your fc you can get a lot of fc if you do this every time you trade
pokemon,not_removed,so another event that requires game registering to get all out of it would be nice if the global link would work but it doesnt the problem is no one with a new account cannot login to the global link to register their games this has been going on and off a long time but apparently total halt to the login happened weeks ago i bought pokemon moon around weeks ago and i am one of those who cannot register my game because before this i havent had account for pokemon trainer club or global link and now that i have one i cannot access global link to register my game contacting support is waste of time because all you get is automated message saying they are fixing the problem and you should try login in periodically weeks and no change nintendo the pokemon company or game freak havent also informed anyone about this problem but happily state on the frontpage of global link how easy it is to register your game they also havent stated that people who suffer from this problem would get any compensation for not being able to register their games and so take part to alola friendly or now take everything out from this global mission if you write support ticket with demand for compensation in good case you get the normal automated message and in bad case your ticket is deleted for more info gamefaq thread
pokemon,not_removed,i love this idea because my new greatest enemy are the pieces of human garbage who put up wingull or some bullshit and request fucking zapdos or a level or below alakazam
pokemon,not_removed,i need mons to complete my living dex and now im pretty sure im going to be able to
pokemon,not_removed,watch us complete it in a day magnemite time edit thanks for the heavy ball magnemite i think ill be keeping that d edit wait did qr teams just open up i can access them now o edit not really related but i think qr teams just opened up in the last minutes
pokemon,not_removed,i want to participate so bad i just registered but when i try to log in to the pokemon global link website it just sends me back to the main page like i didnt even try it to being with
pokemon,not_removed,this is the easiest time ive had with the gts to date magnemite in magnemite out magnemite in magnemite out keep it comin
pokemon,not_removed,hahahhaha i got a magnemite called rdigimon
pokemon,not_removed,pose pose pose pose pose uwdey is surrounded by its zpower uwdey unleashes its fullforce zmove metaphysical magnemite mashup
pokemon,not_removed,if we pass the goal thats fc to waste on rare kitchens yasss and ill definitely get the rare candies
pokemon,not_removed,well now i know how to write magnemite in japanese d
pokemon,not_removed,just a heads up whoever made the shiny rpokemon didnt check off the nickname box on pkhex so its technically not legal
pokemon,not_removed,i was trying to quickly snag a magnemite because it was holding a love ball turns out it was shiny too httpimgurcomanrboa thank you to whoever deposited this magnemite
pokemon,not_removed,i have some breedject magnemite from gen vi can i trade those
pokemon,not_removed,i just caught a beast ball magnemite and named it hey there to anyone who gets them on their journey hey there
pokemon,not_removed,thanks for making an immediate sticky this should be easy
pokemon,not_removed,there and its day one keep it up everyone
pokemon,not_removed,sighgamefreak should have made this the first mission when people were filling up their pokedex trough gts
pokemon,not_removed,ill join in i never knew about the magnemite coil and its really neat dunno why there hasnt been an egg hatching one yet thatd definitely be completed with the sheer number of people breeding ivs and shinies
pokemon,not_removed,this one seems far more manageable so long as people know where to register its kinda dumb that the game doesnt register our activities automaticslly
pokemon,not_removed,ive also taken the liberty of breeding an asteroid belts worth of blue beast ball miniors just for fun and to mix up the magnemitemonotony
pokemon,not_removed,caught a magnemite and renamed it rpokemon i gave it a gold bottle cap and cloned it a few times maybe some of you will get lucky ot is haibara
pokemon,not_removed,this is my first global mission because i had no idea what to do during the first couple bring on the magnemites
pokemon,not_removed,took me a but to get trade for a magnemite to go through i hope that means this plan to is working also got my deposited one to trade as well
pokemon,not_removed,i know youre in here ot selene i didnt even know the rpokemon magnemites were shiny until i looked in the box thank you
pokemon,not_removed,unscm i got one of yours passed it on props on the pokerus
pokemon,not_removed,gonna name my two magnemite wdey and coil
pokemon,not_removed,weve done milliion trades since the games went up that means on average there have been million per week this was a complete softball we dont need to do anything out of the ordinary to win
pokemon,not_removed,nah absolute failure describes it pretty accurately
pokemon,not_removed,if the mission is up now im going go catch some magnemites i hope there will be a receiving end when i put up the magnemites
pokemon,not_removed,what was the magnemite stock exchange
pokemon,not_removed,i was wondering how this was gonna work super excited lets get this done
pokemon,not_removed,im putting up heavy ball magnemites in the next minutes or so they will be named if youre someone that gets one let me know
pokemon,not_removed,i hope my two fortune tellers get the hint and provide me the appropriate buffs for cashing in on gts trades
pokemon,not_removed,someone traded me a good iv japanese magnemite in a beast ball and now im breeding a ton of them
pokemon,not_removed,we need more pokes because most of the magnemites will just be traded until you have chosen your own and it finished loading mirror trading ditto usually works pretty good as well
pokemon,not_removed,great idea this should actually be feasible i have two and two games and will be circulating magnemites as fast as i can of course i get a comfail on my second trade so as fast as i can just took a slowdown
pokemon,not_removed,we gen again boys
pokemon,not_removed,this is easy i got quick balls ill go catch four magnemite
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure most people are doing abras
pokemon,not_removed,magnemite gts trades in i recieved a level ball magnemite nice ill keep that one good thing i kept some of my magnemite breed rejects so im not running out of magnemites edit now i got a heavy ball one aswell neat these gts offers go fast better breed some more heavy ball level ball magnemites for other users to enjoy d
pokemon,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlunvquxyfbs
pokemon,not_removed,okay ive got five shiny level groudons i want to get rid off theyre obviously hacked and cloned to get one of them simply ask for a level groudon and offer a magnemite on the gts please dont reply to this or send me a pm regarding this giveaway its just annoying and im far too lazy to clone more so dont bother asking me edit the two first ones will have a gold bottle cap each cause i dont want them got them in wonder trade so theyre probably hacked and thus ive got no interest in them edit first is gone also cant find the second gold bottle cap d edit aaaaaand a trade got interrupted so im temporarily banned ill try tomorrow at around edit still banned
pokemon,not_removed,to whomever put up a shiny egg move ev trained magnemite thank you
pokemon,not_removed,looks like were already at if we keep this up we should be at least of the way there by the end of the first day
pokemon,not_removed,what the hell i checked the status about ago and we were at after doing a few more coils i checked again we are at how did the number go down
pokemon,not_removed,if it wasnt ridiculously complex to sign up for the pgl id attempt to do this
pokemon,not_removed,haibara thank you for the gold bottle cap on a magnemite named rpokemon
pokemon,not_removed,anyone want to help me connect to my trainer id to my account online every time i try to log onto my account it redirects me to the main login page please help
pokemon,not_removed,shoutout to whoever gave me a dream ball ha flawless magnemite i am going to breed it and send some more of them into the system also whats with the random influx of nonmagnemite seeking trades i see a lot of people with the same nickname i forget what it was something with box asking for stuff like hawlucha and latios
pokemon,not_removed,almost hours into the mission and we already have over trades it seems we will have no problem getting to the mark for the friend balls let alone the clear mark
pokemon,not_removed,seems like everyone is really doing their best because a weve reached nearly trades already and b wondertrade is so empty at the moment d today it happened three times for me that i couldnt find a trade partner never happened before
pokemon,not_removed,its been years and let me tell you
pokemon,not_removed,caught mine ready to go in on this mission
pokemon,not_removed,will go catch the magnemite tonight d
pokemon,not_removed,count me in
pokemon,not_removed,im in
pokemon,not_removed,if anyone gets a magnemite called rpokemon from ot elloss then it is one of mine
pokemon,not_removed,does anyone think that if two trades are compatible that the gts will automatically trade them
pokemon,not_removed,we can do it
pokemon,not_removed,if you get a magnemite from an ayaka thats me im breeding rare ball magnemite im trying to get rare balls nicknames and one in every language tell me if you get one of mine
pokemon,not_removed,going to start trading magnemite soon if you are stuck trading normal magnemite and have the pokerus virus handy you may to infect them before sending on the great magnemite stock exchange edit minor text edit
pokemon,not_removed,im feeling generous so im putting up a magnemite named salazzle holding a bottle cap let me know if you get it
pokemon,not_removed,i wonder when the totals will update its been stuck on for a few hours now
pokemon,not_removed,lets do this
pokemon,not_removed,im gonna just finish my pokèdex first just need igglybuff vanillite and exeggcute and then ill participate
pokemon,not_removed,wow alot of people want zoroarks
pokemon,not_removed,i have a bunch of dratini i can trade instead of magnemite i hate it
pokemon,not_removed,this morning im enjoying trading scatterbugvivillon d
pokemon,not_removed,im definitely gonna get in on this lets crush this mission
pokemon,not_removed,well shoot i just had a connection error on the gts sooo looks like itll be a bit before i can rejoin the magnemite stock exchange shiny searching it is
pokemon,not_removed,finally so i got a ditto on the gts so i will be giving away magnemites galore
pokemon,not_removed,i wasnt looking at the pictures and traded for a random magnemite i got a gold and black one thanks to the kind soul who sent me a shiny magnemite rpokemon will be well cared for
pokemon,not_removed,sounds like a good plan cmon guys lets do this the friend ball we will be rewarded is a nice symbolic gesture of camaraderie
pokemon,not_removed,is there a way to check when your magnemite has been traded other than leaving gts and going back
pokemon,not_removed,this pokémon has already been traded someone is greedy with their magnemites
pokemon,not_removed,sent out a couple magnemites a few of them i stuck rare candies onto hope the recipient enjoyed getting it
pokemon,not_removed,i cant register for pgl since it keeps redirecting me to the forgot your password page i couldnt find a solution for it
pokemon,not_removed,its worth mentioning that abras might be slightly more efficient overall most of us have a massive surplus from wondertrading and the request search is alphabetical
pokemon,not_removed,ive only been able to trade one out of like tries the pokemon are being traded so quickly
pokemon,not_removed,why magnemite though
pokemon,not_removed,you actually need to resister a global link account first
pokemon,not_removed,does anyone know when the mission updates its current count ive seen or we for quite a bit now
pokemon,not_removed,server keeps kicking me out but last i checked i was at trades
pokemon,not_removed,to addi with the gold bottle cap magnemite thank you
pokemon,not_removed,ah hell guess ill join in the fun while i sit bored at work and trade later d
pokemon,not_removed,josh i got your rpokemon magnemite
pokemon,not_removed,i got a magnemite from a guy named gengarfan which had a gold bottle cap so thanks a lot for that im going to send a bunch of beastball magnemites with decent ivs with a lum berry named pancho so expect to get some of them everyone
pokemon,not_removed,ive done trades as of now how many trades has everyone done since starting
pokemon,not_removed,rather than catch mites i sent out female salandit in exchange for them sorry to break the system slightly but i hope they make life easier for whoever took them
pokemon,not_removed,i cant bring myself to give away the shiny virus i got thanks wildskies deposit only for me now
pokemon,not_removed,almost the way there lets pick this up people also damn you snipers are quick
pokemon,not_removed,hi jonathan
pokemon,not_removed,dose wonder trading count
pokemon,not_removed,sending out a magnemite named coilexchange if anybody on the sub gets it id be interested to know
pokemon,not_removed,i gotta say i think tpci came up with a pretty smart solution we failed the first mission which had a goal of ten million and so on the second mission they dumbed it down though the mission was harder they still dropped it all the way down to one million but we failed that too even after doing better so after two failed missions i was thinking the next one is gonna be super easy since were struggling but they have a great solution on the one hand yes its super easy the goal is the same as the last mission and the last mission was something that given it was a pseudodaily event island scanning realistically had a cap on the amount of points a person could get and we still got relatively close this on the other hand is something with no cap imagine how we wouldve done on the island scan mission with no restrictions thats what this is but they then went the extra mile and added a special extra bonus if we hit so now we dont have to worry about failing but we get something extra if we do really well i hope the missions continue like this
pokemon,not_removed,color me surprised d
pokemon,not_removed,we did it reddit
pokemon,not_removed,so is the train dead now we only need more for an extra friend ball
pokemon,not_removed,put in a magnemite named pole iirc default message from poké pelago youre welcome david
pokemon,not_removed,the greatmagnemitescheme is going like a train where right know at keep up the good work
pokemon,not_removed,ill join but only for fc gts a million pokemon we will definitely fail again no game freak will definitely make us fail again
pokemon,not_removed,sigh i can see people getting temporarily banned in the gts due to simultaneous sniping in either case im participating in operation magnemite thanks trade ban system
pokemon,not_removed,has anyone done the math how many trades does person have to contribute to make sure we meet the goal
pokemon,not_removed,just in time got my and pokemon sun d now i can participate in mission what is reward
pokemon,not_removed,i just got good luck on the gts from my fortune teller time to make bank
pokemon,not_removed,whats so special about friend balls ive never seen one so i have no idea
pokemon,not_removed,oh my god yes friend balls are my favourites this is the greatest day that has ever been um
pokemon,not_removed,guess thats how theyll add more apricorns
pokemon,not_removed,this needs be in the op
pokemon,not_removed,still cant get even those the next one is asking for a cosmog so im sure not going there
pokemon,not_removed,this needs more upvotes to be seen
pokemon,not_removed,another lil hint if you already have a magnemite or its evolutions with magnet pull ability put it at the front of your party to find another one really fast
pokemon,not_removed,believe me i tried these people are fast ill see what the records like in a few hours before attempting again but if this pace keeps going we might actually make it
pokemon,not_removed,at this rate we might reverse the polarity of earths magnetic field
pokemon,not_removed,this was my problem last night i was so frustrated with it but still trying to figure out how i would solve this issue my best thought was to be able to continue trading until they retrieve it maybe that wouldnt work great but its what my lack of sleep brain was thinking
pokemon,not_removed,or take me up on my dratini and jagmo offers helping wanks out
pokemon,not_removed,what do you mean stored one how
pokemon,not_removed,im already at in a matter of minutes easy peasy
pokemon,not_removed,if the giveawaytrade subreddits sponsor this too it will probably be really easy
pokemon,not_removed,weve been disappointed before
pokemon,not_removed,dun dun dunn
pokemon,not_removed,i saw one and wanted it but got sniped boo
pokemon,not_removed,why not bread it
pokemon,not_removed,wasted almost all my beast balls trying to do the same dive balls instead lol
pokemon,not_removed,saw it wanted it missed it
pokemon,not_removed,i just received one with that name i love this sub edit umetaridleyscott this yo mite httpimgurcomsnobabh
pokemon,not_removed,got yours just a while ago
pokemon,not_removed,oh they updated pokebank
pokemon,not_removed,i just got an rpokemon but it wasnt one of yours
pokemon,not_removed,i was just about to grab one but the guy was asking for a mawile
pokemon,not_removed,no can do they still havent fixed the pgl game registration page so no new players can signup its been a month and support says they are working on it
pokemon,not_removed,wow thats great thanks for the heads up
pokemon,not_removed,same but when i deposit it almost instantly gets traded ive just been doing that
pokemon,not_removed,finally got rid of one of mine got a shit ton of fc already just for signing up
pokemon,not_removed,just deposit i think the gts has automatic matching so your trades always get completed with a matching request
pokemon,not_removed,its an anticloning protection added in the lockouts last from minutes to hours ive not yet seen anyone figure out just what determines the lockout length
pokemon,not_removed,ill be doing more than one magnemite a day thats for sure
pokemon,not_removed,todays art was gts magnemite check out uwdeys recent posts
pokemon,not_removed,dude that is awesome i am so hoping to get one now
pokemon,not_removed,i got one do you want a picture
pokemon,not_removed,doesnt tekko mean glove in japanese or am i an idiot
pokemon,not_removed,got one
pokemon,not_removed,i got one of yours
pokemon,not_removed,chiming in to say i nabbed one of your magnemites
pokemon,not_removed,just got one
pokemon,not_removed,ohhhh thats what that does
pokemon,not_removed,i appreciate your joke
pokemon,not_removed,this needs plenty of visibility they are just ignoring a very simple fix for a month now i have received the same support ticket response that they are aware and will fix it a month i tried the trick where you change your avatar then try to login again i finally got a different message today they are seriously blaming pokemon go
pokemon,not_removed,a couple of my accounts existed long before even the gen global link did and i experience it from time to time so its demonstrably not about new accounts its not even a new thing in general because it started when the gen global link came up there is indeed a problem on their end but the workaround in the meantime is to keep trying until it works sometimes its taken me over attempts to actually get through but it always works eventually there may also be something to the whole its gos fault thing theyre doing now because it is definitely more common since it released last year
pokemon,not_removed,i think level alakazam is possible now with the poke transporter update not legitimately but possible afaik
pokemon,not_removed,were about a fortieth of the way through the period and were of the way there if more people dont find the mission this rate will bring us to about half way but the previous mission got to
pokemon,not_removed,has been doing it for a while but they continue to release items and missions that we get to miss out on until the fix itif they ever do
pokemon,not_removed,im having the same problem i cant log in to the site as well all it does is just refresh the page
pokemon,not_removed,what do you mean it doesnt say pkhex on the ot for me
pokemon,not_removed,i also received a shiny magnemite holding a love ball and also in a love ball from ot jocelyn thanks jocelyn
pokemon,not_removed,yep bank transfers are perfectly tradable
pokemon,not_removed,no problem its actually been in the planning stages for a couple of days now so it was basically ready to go when the mission launched
pokemon,not_removed,to the friend ball is more how i want to look at it at this point
pokemon,not_removed,its probably a decent idea to do this now since pokebank is available
pokemon,not_removed,just received one gold cap is staying magnemite is being sent back to gts thanks a lot
pokemon,not_removed,yeah by all reports its harder to do search than it is deposit on deposit everyone is competing to find you on search you are competing with everyone else to find the still active trades
pokemon,not_removed,same thanks selene 😀
pokemon,not_removed,that would be uticklemyanusplzthx
pokemon,not_removed,just spreading the love thank rpokerus really i got it from one of theirs that had their name so now im infecting all magnemites i get before tossing them back into the gts
pokemon,not_removed,i just got one of yours
pokemon,not_removed,got one of yours
pokemon,not_removed,hey at least we steadily increased from mission to mission xd
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,just got one probably one that got recycled into the trade it has a little cloud icon on the end though anyway he shall continue to be forwarded
pokemon,not_removed,abras too im sure most people have spare abras after nature breeding them
pokemon,not_removed,i received a level ball magnemite too then im breeding it so there will be more of them for trade
pokemon,not_removed,nice find and a nice grab
pokemon,not_removed,so glad to hear another person got one of my pokémon youre welcome
pokemon,not_removed,right now the gl shows pokemon traded which means approx trades are left so lets do our best and reach this target that was set i am dying for us to reach the target number we were given
pokemon,not_removed,no that doesnt happen
pokemon,not_removed,need some help with that
pokemon,not_removed,its base like most items but thats with compound eyes and unlike others magnemite make up like of the grass there so no need to even chain for it
pokemon,not_removed,just try to get it back if its been more than seconds on a magnemite theres a very good chance its gone in which case you get the traded one instead
pokemon,not_removed,be sure to be depositing your own even if youre having no luck searching youre contributing to the pool of trades that way as well
pokemon,not_removed,its a callback to the system the community used to level join avenue in gen v additionally magnemite is found in the early game and the magnet pull ability makes finding other magnemites in the wild even easier
pokemon,not_removed,also did today
pokemon,not_removed,no
pokemon,not_removed,we want million for that sweet sweet friend ball
pokemon,not_removed,why not we already have recorded and its only been two days
pokemon,not_removed,currency used in the festival plaza used for purchasing new shops and itemsservices from the shops
pokemon,not_removed,not in time to make your pokemon global link bullshit and game sync to get the fc and friend ball utter bullshit
pokemon,not_removed,thats why its special its impossible to buy and you only get a very limited number in sumo
pokemon,not_removed,theyre an apricorn ball which we only get one of per game for some inane reason
pokemon,not_removed,its one of those rare apricorn balls from johto
pokemon,not_removed,its so ridiculous that you need to do this the ui is so clunky its buried so deep in the game
pokemon,not_removed,go to options and use dont include then you cant see all ub or legendaries
pokemon,not_removed,rnebbyinthebag
pokemon,not_removed,congrats now its top comment
pokemon,not_removed,can i have a helping wank
pokemon,not_removed,if you save your game find out your tents fortune and then reset youll be able to save that fortune until you talk to them again to take advantage of said fortune whenever a tents lineup of fortunes wont change until you actually let them happen for the day
pokemon,not_removed,it looks like rpokemontrades has a post about it so heres hoping
pokemon,not_removed,there is only one more will follow this uk evening
pokemon,not_removed,i dont really want the beast balls i used them for ultra beasts but always use standard poké balls for everything else so it isnt a waste for me to do a giveaway of sorts i still have balls left to use up on something
pokemon,not_removed,it sure is compared to all the other mites floating around mine make me remember how bad their movepool was in gen
pokemon,not_removed,they sure have the poke transporter update is a separate download in the eshop
pokemon,not_removed,could be mine dive ball
pokemon,not_removed,which is such bullshitid think pgl would have a significant tech support division i feel awful for everyone who is impacted by this as a month is way too long to let this go yall are missing out on some really fun parts of the game because of their mess up
pokemon,not_removed,i had no idea about this thanks for informing me
pokemon,not_removed,can confirm that with enough persistence you can get it to work right now i reset my game for a wonderlocke last week and with this maintenance my old information is officially gone i requested for it to be deleted this morning i tried to get in and ran into the refreshing bug tried again and again and again until finally it gave the pokemon go error something about pokemon go flooding the server so no new accounts can be created did a hard refresh put in my info one more time and it brought me to the game sync page was able to register my new save file just fine from that point
pokemon,not_removed,thanks i was think i was going nuts this morning trying to log into the account i made for my sun save for this event could not get logged into pgl thought it was me super pathetic effort on their side
pokemon,not_removed,this explains a lot
pokemon,not_removed,i couldnt get the website to work but when i used the mobile page i got to register
pokemon,not_removed,this is what worked for me its worth a try if nothing else is working i had this problem so in the tradition of internet forums heres what worked for me i changed my password using the pokemon trainer club httpsclubpokemoncomuspokemontrainerclubsignup pages on the pokemon website it seems the pgl system uses the same accounts or at least it did for me but the password requirements are different my ptc password didnt match the requirements for pgl passwords once i updated my ptc password to be more complex suddenly i could log in to the pgl without the page just refreshing tldr reset your password using pokemon trainer club add uppercase numbers and characters like i said this is what worked for me i had been trying to log in to pgl but the page just kept refreshing i changed my password and it started working right away
pokemon,not_removed,i registered mine today so it may be fixed now
pokemon,not_removed,yeah im about to stop trying to trade and just deposit i havent been able to get a single one
pokemon,not_removed,any source on this
pokemon,not_removed,why did i get it i was just on the gts trading some ha breedject magnemite from gen vi and then once i tried trading with a cht magnemite something happened and the game told me to power off for some reason
pokemon,not_removed,good luck
pokemon,not_removed,sure pm me anytime
pokemon,not_removed,tekko is actually a type of weapon like brass knuckles and can sometimes be more like iron gauntlets the word for just a standard pair of gloves is tebukuro
pokemon,not_removed,tekketsu means ironblooded i got the name from an anime
pokemon,not_removed,good for you
pokemon,not_removed,good for you
pokemon,not_removed,good for you
pokemon,not_removed,good for you
pokemon,not_removed,the avatar change trick please enlighten me
pokemon,not_removed,during these couple weeks i have tried numerous times to log in but without success from my profession i have tried to locate the issue and i believe i know what the problem is it is that they have way too many sites pokemoncom and at least different sites under pokemonglcom and two different databases pokemoncom has its own and pokemonglcom has its own and they dont work well together fixes to that are quite easy depends on how well they have made their databases but easiest ones are expensive merging the databases but either way i find it very offensive to half the rewards only because they have made system that doesnt work and not even try to inform paying players that there is a problem this critical
pokemon,not_removed,were of the way there now and its only been hours since the challenge started so i think well make this
pokemon,not_removed,i tried getting on usingshudders explorer it said that because of the launch of pokemon go the website was in high demand wow the launch of pokemon go way to keep your website updated and new
pokemon,not_removed,haha fair enough i really want the fc
pokemon,not_removed,yeah true
pokemon,not_removed,im so excited that someone from this sub actually got it youre welcome
pokemon,not_removed,i sent out so far with my name on it was hoping some other subbers would find them along the way so im really glad someone got one i havent been able to connect the last hour so ill try again tomorrow keep on coiling
pokemon,not_removed,awesome yeah i put a random symbol at the end just for kicks thanks for letting me know
pokemon,not_removed,thank you you helped make me day
pokemon,not_removed,already done
pokemon,not_removed,not necessarily the best way to do it normally but it works great for the mse where the trades are happening in seconds just try to take your own magnemite back after seconds or so the chances are very very high that it is long gone by that point and if so you immediately get the traded one instead
pokemon,not_removed,i feel so dumb i was waiting for something to pop up letting me know the pokémon was traded i didnt know you needed to pick take back for it to register
pokemon,not_removed,i see
pokemon,not_removed,dam it
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,but only one what if you miss
pokemon,not_removed,prolly because they are very popular because of their rarity unless you were in johto you have absolutely no chance of finding the balls apricots mist had been extinct in everywhere else even the ones from alola are usually gifts from samson so odds are he got them from prof oak in kanto
pokemon,not_removed,i agree they should just be able to count in of gts trades towards the goal regardless of whether people register or not the other goals were playable offline so it made sense to have to sync to update your score online
pokemon,not_removed,why would anyone trade a legendary for a magnemite
pokemon,not_removed,dammit nebby get off the gts and get back in your bagi meanbed
pokemon,not_removed,why does this have over subscribers oo
pokemon,not_removed,ask my girl friend shes a sloot
pokemon,not_removed,huh interesting thanks
pokemon,not_removed,is there a link that explains this in a different way i dont understand
pokemon,not_removed,i just got one i dont know if its one that was passed around from earlier or someone elses magnemite but i actually managed to complete a trade ill keep it i think d
pokemon,not_removed,niiice got it i saw someone asy they transferred a magnemite from yellow does this mean that the pokemon bank now works with the eshop copies of red blue and yellow o
pokemon,not_removed,i dont remember any more
pokemon,not_removed,its absolutely insane if anyone else is having the issue please log a support ticket they need to know how many people are impacted
pokemon,not_removed,wow this is really bad ive been trying for quite a bit now but to no avail
pokemon,not_removed,doesnt work i tried and characters long passwords with random mix of lower and uppercase letters numbers and symbols
pokemon,not_removed,i do not think this fixes the problem for new users they already had to meet these password requirements in order to make an account in the first place i tested this myself with a new account and it did not work nbsp thanks for trying though theres a lot of frustration around this
pokemon,not_removed,could you be a little more specific without giving away too much obviously maybe the length i tried changing mine to a length mix of numbers symbols etc still doesnt work
pokemon,not_removed,did you do anything specialdifferent or just standard login and it allowed you to register your game a few times today i got to a psyduck screen saying that they are aware of an issue and are fixing it no luck otherwise
pokemon,not_removed,nope but depositing has such a high success rate while seeking does not i cant imagine it would be any other way even when it isnt magnemite
pokemon,not_removed,go back online reconnect to the internet bottom right icon click on the trade icon so the message comes up again while youre online save then do something else and come back in minutes or so i cant guarantee thatll work but it always clears it up for me also it happens when someone else grabs the pokemon youre trading for at the exact same time one person gets the pokemon the other gets the blue screen of death
pokemon,not_removed,ah til
pokemon,not_removed,gundam
pokemon,not_removed,definitely
pokemon,not_removed,aw too bad i got locked out for about minutes earlier but ive been trading since then
pokemon,not_removed,that or exit the gts and return the take back is not the best strategy normally but in the current situation where these trades are completed in seconds its perfect
pokemon,not_removed,tough luck then you only get one ingame anyways so this effectively doubles it
pokemon,not_removed,well you save beforehand
pokemon,not_removed,just save and reset before using it
pokemon,not_removed,i always save before trying to use one
pokemon,not_removed,find what pokemon you want then save first p
pokemon,not_removed,save prior soft reset with lrstart
pokemon,not_removed,well then why cant he just be an importer of apricorn balls kurt needs to get with gen vii
pokemon,not_removed,pew
pokemon,not_removed,why wouldnt it have over subscribers
pokemon,not_removed,what im understanding is that the fortune tents in festival plaza dont actually change what fortune they give out each day instead the game randomly determines that your next fortune is going to be decent luck in gts for example and it will stay that way until you talk to the fortune teller so this means you could talk to the fortune teller to learn what fortune youll be given reset without saving and then dont talk to the fortune teller again until a day when you want to activate that fortune granted i havent tried this for myself but it sounds interesting if thats actually the case
pokemon,not_removed,if the ot is xin it is me if not someone else is discovering the true origins of magnemite there are now in the system d
pokemon,not_removed,that is correct the pokemon transferred from the gen vc games also have their hidden abilities guaranteed perfect ivs and a gameboy symbol instead of the gen plus symbol
pokemon,not_removed,i did a month ago i also asked if they could sync my game through their support service instead of pgl no response
pokemon,not_removed,standard login and was able to register
pokemon,not_removed,right in
pokemon,not_removed,ah ok glad it wasnt my machine ill be back at it tomorrow i hit trades today last time i checked
pokemon,not_removed,i guess i could breed them for more pokemon in the balls but still kinda stingy
pokemon,not_removed,touché
pokemon,not_removed,ahhh okay thanks i tried to reset for different fortunes but it didnt work so this is interesting
pokemon,not_removed,what do fortunes do i just got rid of a level sinnoh tent thinking the fortune things were useless
pokemon,not_removed,sweeet time to buy red and yellow i wish theyd put silver and gold on eshop too
pokemon,not_removed,how do the natures look
pokemon,not_removed,nice
pokemon,not_removed,most people who use the rare balls for collecting will know to with false swipe and sleep most of their targets
pokemon,not_removed,you basically have to choose what species you want in that ball but if its male andor has bad ivs you can breed with ditto to pass down a males ball but thats still frustrating
pokemon,not_removed,they unlock new phrases for you to use the things that people will see when they interact with you in fp and can increase your luck in various parts of fp so if you have good luck in the gts missions etc youll get more fc than normal that day
pokemon,not_removed,the fortunes will either increase the amount of fc you get from using various features wonder trade gts missions or talking to visitors or theyll give you bonus items at a lottery shop or ghost house each of these buffs has three levels of effectiveness with decent luck giving fc good luck being and very good luck being im not sure if the effectiveness levels effect the lottery shop or ghost house though since ive never gotten above decent luck with them
pokemon,not_removed,red and yellow
pokemon,not_removed,the way transporter works im guessing thats their plan
pokemon,not_removed,natures are determined by the number of experience points the pokemon had in gen you can take a look at the natures page on serebii for more details httpwwwserebiinetgamesnaturesshtml
pokemon,not_removed,and to save beforehand in order to reset on a miss
pokemon,not_removed,thats why i have my breloom as my catching mon false swipe with spore works every time
pokemon,not_removed,do people actually try to catch pokemon without using false swipe first
pokemon,not_removed,if its the same species the offspring have chance to inherit either parents ball
pokemon,not_removed,i thought ditto doesnt pass down its ball
pokemon,not_removed,well i only bought blue when they first came out on the eshop
pokemon,not_removed,that wont work if youre facing a ghost or grass type not to mention abra or any other pokemon that flees you should bring a smeargle that knows false swipesporesoakspider web instead
pokemon,not_removed,it really depends on the pokemon and its catch rate most earlygame pokemon have a catch rate so high that it is nearly impossible to miss even with the opposing pokemon at full health
pokemon,not_removed,in i had a samurott with false swipe i caught a shitload of pokemon that game
pokemon,not_removed,teamquickball have caught legendarys with one single quick ball
pokemon,not_removed,i get em down to red and throw ultra balls until they are caught tbh i didnt even know what false swipe was until i looked it up after seeing these comments i guess i should try to look for a good specific pokemon for catching
pokemon,not_removed,this is also separate to ha so you can pass apricorn balls on to ha pokemon now
pokemon,not_removed,it doesnt the other pokemon that you breed with a ditto does
pokemon,not_removed,thus youd have a chance to get the friend ball if you choose to breed with ditto
pokemon,not_removed,just gts it tons of people breeding starters
pokemon,not_removed,popplio is awesome stick with it its final form is extremely powerful with very high s atk and s def and its unique move is by far the coolest really popplios line starts becoming extremely powerful immediately after the part youre at
pokemon,not_removed,rowlets amazing
pokemon,not_removed,but popplio got encore though which works wonder against npc also typing wise primarina can handle all elite four member easily it can learn water fairy ghost and ice special attack moves edit oh i also got lucky and got a groundtype hidden power on my primarina which handle of its weaknesses
pokemon,not_removed,so far ive gotten rowlet on wondertrade spend an hour doing that you might get some other treats for your dex
pokemon,not_removed,update i did end up starting over but ive got some awesome pokemon through wonder trade and gts i ended up getting a popplio after choosing rowlet and an alolan vulpix
pokemon,not_removed,throw something up on the gts asking for popplio youll probably get a hit edit rowlet my dyslexia in kicked
pokemon,not_removed,i dont care for popplio strictly based on design so i havent used it yet but if it is anything like litten you have to really work with it torracat has finally stood its ground around level now but prior to that he was kind of a wuss i vote keep on going
pokemon,not_removed,yeah and everyone wants solgaleo for it lol
pokemon,not_removed,i kind of regret the rowlet grassghost weaknesses is pretty bad end game almost everything has a dark move
pokemon,not_removed,im probably way out of the loop here but what is gts
pokemon,not_removed,go to options and click dont include legendaries and event pokemon helps a ton
pokemon,not_removed,go to the festival plaza button on your lower screen click on the trade button go to gtsglobal trade station deposit whatever you want to trade and ask for the rowlet protip if you havent seen the pokemon you want scroll down and click last option and you can write in the mon you want
pokemon,not_removed,thanks so much
pokemon,not_removed,no problem
pokemon,not_removed,ash hunts chipmunks in the bushes just like me
pokemon,not_removed,simply beautiful
pokemon,not_removed,its the tongue sticking slightly out that does it for me
pokemon,not_removed,intimidate more like cute charm am i right ladies and gentleman
pokemon,not_removed,mightyhena is one of my favorites too reminds me of my dog
pokemon,not_removed,mightyena used rest its super effective
pokemon,not_removed,i need a mega for mightyena
pokemon,not_removed,underappreciated pokemon so is swablu actually
pokemon,not_removed,unreal would you be able to do a cool arcanine one plz
pokemon,not_removed,amazing mightyena fan art hello new favourite person thanks for brightening my day
pokemon,not_removed,this is very relaxing to look at would make a great wallpaper love your art man
pokemon,not_removed,you seem like youd fit in well with middle management at team magma p
pokemon,not_removed,this is so cool i love seeing mightyena fan art you did an awesome job i like your art style
pokemon,not_removed,so much talent here very beautiful drawing
pokemon,not_removed,nice work op
pokemon,not_removed,nawwwwwwwwwwwwww
pokemon,not_removed,i love this
pokemon,not_removed,cool whats the dog one called
pokemon,not_removed,aww i wanna pet it
pokemon,not_removed,thank you
pokemon,not_removed,its because my cat used to sleep like that hehe glad you like it
pokemon,not_removed,its an important cute touch
pokemon,not_removed,i like the light blurring around the edges its very subtle
pokemon,not_removed,rblep
pokemon,not_removed,we do need a mega mightyena
pokemon,not_removed,i agree
pokemon,not_removed,mightyena its in the title
pokemon,not_removed,i like the sleepy swablus taking a nap
pokemon,not_removed,swablus are so cute hehehe
pokemon,not_removed,inflicting it with a status effect will stop the calls for help
pokemon,not_removed,put the pokemon to sleep or paralyze it it and im pretty sure it cant call for help
pokemon,not_removed,such a broken feature love the idea hate the execution
pokemon,not_removed,ive been frustrated by this feature for the same reason its impossible to aim unless theres only one pokémon is just silly
pokemon,not_removed,you are awesome took number and thank you upvote for you
pokemon,not_removed,i think it should be standard practice and is a great idea really bummed out i cant have that sweet chars genesect japan got and nobunagas rayquaza and the gen shiny beasts i want em usable in current games
pokemon,not_removed,japan is already doing that
pokemon,not_removed,or they could just not do event pokemon theyve never served any purpose other than selling gamesharksaction replays
pokemon,not_removed,or at least hoopa
pokemon,not_removed,i really just want a bagon with wish
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think id care all that much if they would just allow for them to be able to be bred i would love to start with a level xerneas maybe a meloetta
pokemon,not_removed,no i like having my tru arceus with judgement and the sinnoh signature moves
pokemon,not_removed,i feel like thatd diminish their value
pokemon,not_removed,source
pokemon,not_removed,id rather that this be the case but we all know they wont stop i think that my suggestion is somewhat of a compromise
pokemon,not_removed,thats not really fair they do events for regular pokemon that are just special versions of them too after all what they should do is give those special traits a way to be passed down sing on piplup being an egg move but only if another piplup was the parent for example
pokemon,not_removed,did you need one ive got an extra
pokemon,not_removed,i know you want to continue to feel superior but tell me how you feel if you ever loose that cart
pokemon,not_removed,japan they gets all the good stuff
pokemon,not_removed,they did that with dragonite and only dragonite extremespeed is a standard egg move but the only possible parent is a dragonite meaning you have to have gotten the special one to begin with
pokemon,not_removed,sure ill hit you up what would you like in return
pokemon,not_removed,thats not the only thing i have on my cart i have a ton or shines from serebii when hg and ss was popular but mainly the arceus is my concern if i lost it is be bummed because thats at least years of memories going back to platinum being lost
pokemon,not_removed,thats fine once someone breeds one they trade the babies and it gets spread around that way its still kind of an event but not as bad as being exclusive to one almost like having to breed for has that are tied to event releases really
pokemon,not_removed,how about a manaphy from tomorrows event
pokemon,not_removed,yeah it sucks i literally just found out that the save file on my pokemon y got corrupted luckily most of my pokemon were on the pokemon bank but i lost my shiny zoroark my absolute favorite shiny and my shiny whimsicott
pokemon,not_removed,you have to admit that itd be cool to get a legit event new from red
pokemon,not_removed,absolutely thanks d
pokemon,not_removed,events didnt take off until gen literally in gen it was a single mew and thats it and they did already recreate it in japan only of course
pokemon,not_removed,pm me your friend code tomorrow
pokemon,not_removed,absolutely
pokemon,not_removed,compared to other anime its pretty bad compared to the other seasons of pokemon its relatively better
pokemon,not_removed,tell them garbodor isnt in it
pokemon,not_removed,but it is trash ash is still doing the same shit hes always done team rocket still does the same shit theyve always done during most episodes most episodes are still mindless cotd fillers and the ones that arent still have gradeschoollevel plot and the supporting characters are even more cliched than they were in past generations the only improvement the show has made is with the animation for the major battles and holy shit the way some fans talk about it makes it seem like theyre using state of the art technology and top of their craft animators to compose awardwinning battles on a weekly basis the show still looks several years behind most good anime released these days especially the backgrounds during the battles and would only be impressive to people who havent seen an anime outside of the popular nineties and early aughts ones like the original pokemon and dragon ball z
pokemon,not_removed,maybe because you shouldnt judge it by other animes standards
pokemon,not_removed,i cant find other anime that i can click to no problem i tried dbz but i got to out of it to quickly it just wasnt my cup of tea
pokemon,not_removed,would only be impressive to people who havent seen an anime outside of the popular nineties yeah i havent watched any anime since pokemon in the early so i think this series is especially good compared to what i saw before like the guy said above ash is an awful character but thats unfortunately by design if they have him succeed in his quest they will have to come up with further plot ideas which they probably dont want to do however i really feel with all the revenue that they bring in from their games they can afford to take a little more risk on the anime and try different plot scenarios but seeing that the anime isnt their main source of income that will probably never happen
pokemon,not_removed,totally agree the problem with pokemon in general is that they have so much money and expectation invested they cannot or will not take risks by deviating from what they know works ash is an awful character and a shit trainer and pikachu is not really even that popular amongst fans but they both are still the main focus of a show that could easily have introduced a new protagonist in each season instead of having the same dimwit failing in his quest in a new region after new region but its what they did in the first season and it worked so they cant deviate from it for fear of potentially losing fans same thing in the main games simplistic meaningless dialogue and no story and this game sold like hotcakes its a winning formulae dont fucking touch it so even when they tried to have a deep story in bw they still kept it in a bucket instead of a pool for fear of alienating a single fan below a first grade comprehension level the games still have so much to offer but the anime other than seeing pokemon animated it doesnt do anything well at all i always assumed people only watched it out of obligation as pokemon fans so it always blows my mind when anybody brings it up in any serious context let alone tries to sell it on its quality i stopped watching it in the johto series when i was and realized it was a shit show and i had better options it being pokemon is not enough justification to watch it over literally half of the anime out there
pokemon,not_removed,its human to make comparisons people develop their own tastes and standards by summating all of their past experiences if i find something better to my tastes why should i lower my standards to try and enjoy something i would not enjoy
pokemon,not_removed,the thing is anime isnt a genre its a style theres many genres within it whether you like horror action comedy drama romance slapstick theres guaranteed an anime for that
pokemon,not_removed,completely disagree i agree other previous seasons of pokemon were trash and repetitive but xy has given us a spark and is a step in the right direction i honestly cant agree with you when you base all of pokemon on kanto and johto
pokemon,not_removed,its not about lowering your standards its just you should judge everything differently since well they are completely different things both of them may be animes but they are about two different things so why would you look at it the same way
pokemon,not_removed,thats understandable id ask for suggestions but itd be better if i went to the anime subreddit
pokemon,not_removed,i have seen more recent episodes and i cant argue its still the exact same level of trash but going from a to a is still a failing grade
pokemon,not_removed,oh im not comparing pokemon to just any other anime im basing it against other anime within the same genre that have done it much better im not daft enough to compare it to something like dbz or kill la kill or mushi shi for instance digimon handled its anime so much better than pokemon they knew it was aimed at kids and young adults but they kept it from being stagnant now digimon isnt the best but its comparatively better
pokemon,not_removed,yes and no while it is fair to claim that you shouldnt compare the value of a comedy to a drama like say the hangover to schindlers list due to the two having different goals it can still be said that there are objective values that movies or tv shows can miss the mark on comparing pokemon to mushi shi is not fair because they have totally different target audiences so i can say that i enjoy mushi shi more because i fall in its target demographic adult versus pokemons children that being said pokemon in my opinion is mediocre compared even to other anime targeted towards children shows like hunter x hunter dragon ball or one piece are easily better but its a monster collection show so it shouldnt be compared to those right well even on that front digimon had a better anime and it is vastly inferior to the likes of natsumes book of friends with repetitive and boring story arcs poor dialogue and an abhorrently unlikable protagonist in ash ketchum pokemon is most certainly not a very good anime edit ninjad by uhoennborn made pretty much the same points i made but with much more brevity
pokemon,not_removed,while i do see your side and to a point agree for the sake of fairness consider this no matter how fair the comparison is youre going to be asking someone to watch this one single thing out of all of the things they could be watching otherwise you have to sell them on it not for its merits against just those in its genre but when you get down to it against pretty much anything else someone could be doing unless this person is asking to watch a similar show i can see why why they should watch it over even completely different things would come up its not necessarily fair no but at the same time isnt it fair to consider the other persons perspective in this area ive been in your position before and i know how it feels when you know someone would like something and they wont touch it and worse when youve been proven right and they still wont budge later on different things but thats how it goes
pokemon,not_removed,honestly speaking the pokemon anime is pretty devoid of actual overarching plot its full of procedural filler and very rarely theyll do multi episode arcs xy has been changing that from what i hear
pokemon,not_removed,wwwmyanimetoplistcom is a great resource actually their list is curated by hundreds of users and is pretty accurate at ranking shows from best to worst barring subjectivity so it is an awesome place to find new shows to watch btw full metal alchemist brotherhood is consistently listed in the top three on most lists it is pretty much anime perfection if you really enjoyed pokemon i think a great show that has a similar feel would be one piece so those two would be good places to start
pokemon,not_removed,im not saying the anime is excellent but its a minimum although i guess the anime isnt your taste which is totally fine
pokemon,not_removed,natsumes book of friends how could i have forgotten easily a prime example its stylistically different but its got the same goals
pokemon,not_removed,eh it might be more to do with myself falling outside of pokemons target age group and the creators making no effort to appeal to people above that age than it not being my taste i was exaggerating by saying it went from to but it is still a subpar show that is competing with better shows for its viewers time by presenting low quality animation yes a still repetitive plot and flat two dimensional characters i mean httpsyoutubewgbdwvaci is a significant improvement that scene was chock full of continuity errors static imagery and is just a lame fight compared to offerings like what you find in or like the previous commenter said unless you are unfamiliar with anime outside of late early offerings the pokemon anime is not even a little impressive and is at most a out of
pokemon,not_removed,how could i have forgotten because pokemon is not even in the same league the only thing that you can say pokemon has on it is the number of battles but even in the rare moments when things get violent in book of friends they have more weight and tension also one of my favorite things about comparing the two is how one of the biggest criticisms of pokemon is how frequently and without good reason ash releases his pokemon with a lame excuse of friendship he does it because he loves them and not because the writers are too lazy to come up with better ways to introduce new pokemon to his team while in nbof his natsume releasing the youkai actually ties into the moral of the show that sometimes letting go gains you the most
pokemon,not_removed,maybe im biased but it seems you missed a perfectly good opportunity to use raticate for junkrat lmb hyper fang shift sucker punch e super fang passive last resort q flame wheel
pokemon,not_removed,ahh flame wheel would work well it could demolish all those op steel types
pokemon,not_removed,what can i say except youre welcome it wasnt me but im sure they are singing that right now
pokemon,not_removed,wow lucky you i traded a honedge for a diglett named dickhead it wasnt even a normal diglett either
pokemon,not_removed,a shiny starter holding a gold bottle cap probably hacked sorry to burst your bubble if you had one
pokemon,not_removed,sounds like its hacked any time i get one of those i just let them sit in the pc box i would feel icky for using hacked pokemon and releasing them or rewonder trading them would undermine that persons supposedly nice gesture
pokemon,not_removed,c o n s i d e r t h e c o c o n u t
pokemon,not_removed,moana
pokemon,not_removed,yesterday i was trading some breeding excess and got zapdos a nicknamed zubat
pokemon,not_removed,too perfect plus the ot kinda gives it away
pokemon,not_removed,uh i think thats kinda obvious but it doesnt really matter as long as the pokémon has legal stats and stuff it wouldnt be able to wondertrade if it was illegal so theres no reason for the op to be concerned
pokemon,not_removed,letting them take up space in your box is pretty much the worst of all possible worlds you minorly inconvenience yourself and nobody gets to use the original traders gift i just pack those obviously hacked pokemon on down the wonder trade stream personally someone without my compunction for pure pokemon will get some use out of it
pokemon,not_removed,the what
pokemon,not_removed,of motunui you will board my boat you will cross the ocean and you will restore the heart of tapu fini
pokemon,not_removed,at least name it articuno since its the same shade as zubat
pokemon,not_removed,or somebody with your compunction who doesnt realise which is probably even worse dont you think edit not sure why im being downvoted i didnt even give my own opinion on hacking in this post at all i just pointed out another group which might get some use out of the hacked pokemon one which doesnt realise its hacked and on learning that would stop using it i then suggested that wonder trading a hacked pokemon may be bad because such a person would prefer the peace of mind that the pokemon they get are legit im personally not sure whats so deplorable here
pokemon,not_removed,consider its tree happy new year
pokemon,not_removed,it isnt though
pokemon,not_removed,is it they get to enjoy their shiny pokémon and think its the coolest thing ever net positive happiness
pokemon,not_removed,im a little late here and i dont really agree with you but its a shame you drew fire over this im assuming that for the most part were talking about blatantly obvious level perfect iv shinies if you think someones trading those legit through wonder trade at that point its just ignorance is bliss i didnt define obviously i received a pokemon with egg moves that are illegal prepokebank which puts me in a group like what you posited but i wouldnt be intentionally be putting those back out either as its not obvious unless youve got serebii memorized basically given you have to accept some level of responsibility for possibly accepting the results of hackinggenningcloningwhatever to use wonder trade at all i assume anyone who is concerned about a pokemons perceived illegitimacy will have a similar too good to be true reaction that i have
pokemon,not_removed,i cant tell if youre joking or if you genuinely thought i wasnt also doing that song
pokemon,not_removed,i got a lvl shiny salazzle with flawless ivs off wonder trade i dont care that its hacked in and i still use it ingame i never go into competitive so i dont worry about people shaming me for having a hacked pokémon
pokemon,not_removed,i dont want peoples hacked pokemon whether i know theyre hacked or not some people dont want to accept them out of ignorance
pokemon,not_removed,if its not real it doesnt count its like all those funny reddit posts and half the comments are how its not real so we cant laugh
pokemon,not_removed,i wasnt specifically talking about anything you wouldnt intentionally put illegal pokemon back out someone else might and a recipient might not realise or as you say it could just be a hacked shiny or something im not talking about people actively conscious of receiving illegitimate pokemon im talking about people who may be aware of hacking and dont want hacked pokemon but are not actively looking out for them on wt
pokemon,not_removed,i dont have a problem with you using your hacked pokemon its not my concern the problem is that way i feel like people maybe not you specifically are misinterpreting my position to be hacking is bad you scum which isnt what i was trying to say
pokemon,not_removed,and some people arent like you shocker
pokemon,not_removed,im a subscriber of rthathappened and just about everything on there is fake i think its pretty funny
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i know i was just trying to give an example of how a hacked pokémon might make someones day
pokemon,not_removed,some people are like me super shocker
pokemon,not_removed,exactly if it makes you laugh its funny regardless of its authenticity do people really think that when comedians go up and tell a story about something that happened to them every single one is true
pokemon,not_removed,thats irrelevant people are trying to put down op for their hacked shiny thats why i said people arent like you
pokemon,not_removed,then thats irrelevant i wasnt putting down op if op likes it im super happy for him i dont know what youre trying to tell me youre acting like youre bestowing new information on me and youre really not the op was clearly unaware their pokemon was probably hacked and knowing that could change their opinion on it thats why i dont think hacked pokemon should be wonder traded seems like a what you dont know cant hurt you situation but i and im sure others would rather know
pokemon,not_removed,coasters pretty sweet is that like bathroom tile i love gengar hes my favorite pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,thanks and yea its just a tile
pokemon,not_removed,my first favorite pokemon was sceptile my current favorite pokemon is still sceptile
pokemon,not_removed,ive always loved magnemite and magneton but im a little disappointed with magnezones design i too have always had an affinity for feraligatr its just so cool
pokemon,not_removed,i always used to be a fan of flygon no other pokemon stood out to me back then but now im an even bigger fan of flygon
pokemon,not_removed,first back in starmie now still starmie but its opened my interest in psychic pokemon and that type has become my ultimate favourite until now always excited to see the new psychic types theyll introduce whenever a new region comes along starmie is great great design and movepool and i remember ash was taken aback battling mistys staryu in the anime because it doesnt have a face lol
pokemon,not_removed,then sandslash nidoking raichu flareon and ninetales now ampharos darkrai exploud umbreon and ninetales
pokemon,not_removed,when i was a kid i always like the old cubone trading card so i always kind of like him as a pokemon now while i still kinda like cubone design lore and stuff i like lanturn and garchomp both are awesome and saved my ass a couple of times
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know i might have used to have a different favorite and just not remember my old favorite or if it simply hasnt changed i do know however that my current favorite is eevee
pokemon,not_removed,my favourite back in gen was definitely caterpie i just thought that the sound it made in the anime was pretty cute then came gen and i havent looked back on typhlosion ever since the whole flames erupting from its back business was what sold me other favourites include torterra kyurem tyranitar and scizor mostly due to aesthetics as well pretty gen heavy as you can see but i do like some pokémon from the other generations as well
pokemon,not_removed,growlithe cyndaquilevolutions furret now same as those just add dedenne
pokemon,not_removed,first arcanine ninetales blastoise now absol ninetales lopunny roserade meowstic braixen
pokemon,not_removed,when i was a kid my favorite pokemon were scyther charmeleon raichu kadabra golduck and vaporeon now my favorites are gyarados luxray skitty scrafty lopunny and flygon back then my favorites mostly came from the anime but now theyre based more on who i like having on my team in game
pokemon,not_removed,then nidoking rhydon charazard dragonite tyranitar arcanine now slowbro garchomp gardevoir mmawile tyrantrum shiny gyarados lots of big monsters back in the day with today being a bit more of a mix which funny enough almost all of them can mega
pokemon,not_removed,first blastoise now deino
pokemon,not_removed,my favorite was gardevoir all the way back when i first played on emerald as a youngling and today it still isi just wish the internet didnt have to ruin everythingugh
pokemon,not_removed,i was pretty obsessed with pikachu when i first started playing pokémon it doesnt surprise me since pikachu was everywhere another favourite i remember was cyndaquil he was always my starter and is the only pokémon i can remember on my silvercrystal team lugia was popular with me too now i adore eevee i dont really have any other favourites i like playing with different pokémon
pokemon,not_removed,i used to like eevee and gible a lot now my favorites new pokemon are crustle roggenrola and whisimcott
pokemon,not_removed,the gastly line has always been a favorite of mine i like the axew line too
pokemon,not_removed,my favorite back when i first started playing yellow was raichu but i hated my pikachu because it wouldnt evolve now my favorite is slowking
pokemon,not_removed,my first favorite pokemon had to be bulbasaur nowadays id have to say my favorite pokemon is ampharos ive had one on just about all of my teams since soulsilver
pokemon,not_removed,as a child i used to get ridiculously attached to my personal teams which almost always were finished before the first gym blaziken mightyena gardevoir ludicolo swellow and breloom were my favorite pokemon in the whole hoenn region when i was a kid now probably only gardevoir would make it onto a top or even top list same with fr i used to adore blastoise pidgeot arcanine primape graveler didnt ever evolve him and nidoking but most of their designs are pretty meh to me now
pokemon,not_removed,first marowak now marowak
pokemon,not_removed,then lucario rayquaza typhlosion mewtwo darkrai giratina now reuniclus furret medicham weezing sylveon ampharos ive gone from liking mostly legendaries and cooltough pokémon to pokémon i really enjoy using or ones that i find cute
pokemon,not_removed,i can never forget my team from gold it included typhlosion noctowl ampharos quagsire jumpluff and umbreon i changed noctowl to pidgeotto in kanto of course i use only regional pokemon in my teams in every new game but i would say the only one that i still love to this day is quilava i didnt really wanna evolve it in gold and pidgeotto which is my most favorite regional bird hoenn had some great pokemon but my favorites would be grovyle and flygon sinnoh had infernape luxray and buizel that i love to this day unova only had volcarona that i liked and kalos had noivern and sylveon then typhlosion pidgeotto ampharos quagsire jumpluff umbreon now quilava buizel grovyle pidgeotto luxray noivern
pokemon,not_removed,forever nidoking then age and now age scizor and rhydon have also always been up there but not quite edit sheit how could i forget absol is a thing too
pokemon,not_removed,my first favorite pokemon i can remember was either eevee or togetictogetic because of a holographic card i had when i was a kid that i loved the art of i didnt actually play the video games until platinum and hgss were around so i had no idea what it was like in there my favorite pokemon now is probably meowth overall but i also enjoy dedenneits cry in the games is so adorable and im still pretty fond of eevee even though it took me literal years of painful breeding to get a shiny one
pokemon,not_removed,bulbasaur every gen game i always trade a bulba for my game throughout
pokemon,not_removed,i never had a favorite pokemon until emerald i felt in love with cyndaquil since then and until now cynda and his evos are my favourite pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,up until a few months ago umbreon now slowking
pokemon,not_removed,totodileferaligatr then totodileferaligatr now slowbro worked its way close but it cant dethrone my first ever pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,my faves back then were bulbasaur cubone and growlithe still loving bulbasaur but lucario and emolga have become my new favourites over cubone and growlithe
pokemon,not_removed,the first pokemon game i played when i was younger was emerald first starter torchic been my fav pokemon since then although the torchic line is still up there the froakie line is becoming a personal fav
pokemon,not_removed,my favorites used to be blaziken since he was the one who carried my whole ruby team being overleveled and all however over the years ive used a lot more competative pokemon that i became attached to scizor garchomp lucario salamence now ive recently begin to really like diancie too however even more recently i begin to really love espurr and meowstic for being so damn adorable espurr seems so lost all the time i just want to hug it
pokemon,not_removed,then blissey and mew cause theyre pink and thats my favorite color now froslass because i love ice and ghosts are really cool
pokemon,not_removed,then pikachu gardevoir and altaria now raichu gardevoir scizor and glaceon using an ice type pokemon at the beginning of alpha sapphire made it a breeze and the game is already easy but i love making eggs on one game and transferring to another so i can begin with the pokes i want edit i liked to change the starter for pikachu as well just one egg so i could pretend i was playing yellow so much fun even more because pikachu can get his ass handed pretty often in the beginning
pokemon,not_removed,my favourite pokemon when i first started playing was articunoblastoise considering they were my first pokemon now klefki is my favourite pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,my first favourite was wigglytuff way back during gen gen introduced plenty more pokemon that i liked quite alot but nothing could topple the tuff for that spot then gen completely hit a home run gardevoir latias armaldo so many mons jostled for my top spot gardevoir settled into the new spot and latias took second place wigglytuff moved down to spot gen was like gen lots of great pokemon but nothing forced its way into my favourites still torterra is just outside my top gen was mostly a miss for me but it had one shining star lilligant the flower princess kicked gardevoir out of my spot and has held it ever since even when gen introduced fairy types which i love and gardevoir made a big push for retaking her throne by acquiring said fairy type lilligant held out shes still my favourite wigglytuff on the other hand pushed past latias back into with that new fairy type so far none of the gen mons look like theyll be taking lilligant gardevoir or wigglytuff down but well see my top stand ready
pokemon,not_removed,first was probably bulbasaur seel or growlithe then gen came i saw houndour and its been my favorite ever since kalos introduced my to skiddo and gogoat who i love so much but houndour is still my favorite
pokemon,not_removed,my first favorite was lucario then flareon then glaceon then sceptile then galvantula currently though im not sure ninjask or smeargle maybe
pokemon,not_removed,salamence is still my favorite right behind him is absol giratina and most of the hoenn legendaries
pokemon,not_removed,then chikorita dragonite hooh celebi now chikorita line dragonite hooh celebi not much has changed goldsilvercrystal love
pokemon,not_removed,i started with ruby sapphire emerald when i was like or something and i just played my cousins cart on his team he had a sceptile exploud kyogre altaria shedinja and linoone hm slave my six favourites now are lucario gardevoir hydreigon luxray alakazam and torterra
pokemon,not_removed,i cant really say what my favourite was when i first started playing it was and i began with diamond so it was probably infernape but i can say that around the release of hgss that it became umbreon and stayed that way until gen came out i thought umbreons model was really ugly so he dropped off from number being replaced by absol then at some point in i noticed that gardevoir was finding its way into pretty much every team i made and i guess it was at that point that i decided that it had to be my favourite its been that way ever since so i suppose its this infernape umbreon absol gardevoir
pokemon,not_removed,then charmander vileplume dragonairdratini because of the anime opening mew now larvitar roserade cyndaquil teddiursa milotic and gardevoir
pokemon,not_removed,i dont really know never had one favorite i like arcaninedarkraiabsolgrovyle but now i love gengar and espeon
pokemon,not_removed,starmie and starmie
pokemon,not_removed,nidoking is still my goto answer as is bulbasaur for favorite starter usually tepig rivals it now buttt haxorus and sylveon both rose in the ranks really quickly sylveon may get closer when i finally use it ingame like ive done with haxorus pain to raise as a baby admittedly but early on and at the end make it worth it
pokemon,not_removed,sceptile is definitely still up there for me too got me through ruby and omega ruby
pokemon,not_removed,i have an arcanine tattooed on my right arm feraligatr will be on the left some day
pokemon,not_removed,username checks out
pokemon,not_removed,when i was younger i thought starmie was kind of dumb probably for the same reason ash was taken aback but i used one in white and loved it might have had my favorite movepool of any pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,eevee is a good favorite do you have a favorite eeveelution
pokemon,not_removed,do you have a favorite eeveelution
pokemon,not_removed,ampharos is an underrated badass how do you like the megaevolution
pokemon,not_removed,any particular reason you preferred the middle evolutions
pokemon,not_removed,ive used nidoking in just about every gen game hes a beast i always evolve him just in time to destroy lt surge what are your thoughts on rhyperior
pokemon,not_removed,i honestly cant say i do
pokemon,not_removed,i love them all but maybe espeon or vaporeon or jolteon lol
pokemon,not_removed,man i totally agree i really loved mega ampharos during my first playthrough of pokemon y that thing was the literal backbone of my team it was so awesome to see my absolute favorite pokemon get the recognition it deserved plus that electricdragon typing it was a literal beast
pokemon,not_removed,well i dont really play pokemon competitively so im not into getting those strong and ohko pokemon these are my favorites aesthetically i know the middle evos are weaker and stuff but ive always had an affinity towards the designs of middle evos theyre like cool and cute at the same time
pokemon,not_removed,what are your thoughts on rhyperior not as cool as rhydon when i first saw it i didnt think it was an evolved rhydon either not too bad though
pokemon,not_removed,i wasnt always a fan of mega ampharos loved the design because i had salamence on my team and it messed up the balance but my ampharos quickly proved how much of a bigger badass she became
pokemon,not_removed,im not competitive either but i still thought that these were pretty unique favorites i kind of wish the final evolutions of starters didnt evolve until later so you had more time with the middle evolutions its almost too fast something close to the pseudolegendary evolution levels would be cool minus the deino line
pokemon,not_removed,yah everyone is bound to have megas they arent fond of personally i find mega salamences design hilarious mainly because it looks like some sort of boomarangdragon hybrid
pokemon,not_removed,i think being the middle is one of the main reasons they dont receive enough love people mostly remember the cutesy baby pokemon that they chose as a startercaught and always remember the strong badass pokemon that theyve trained and evolved to be perfect i agree they should increase the time with middle evos since theres levels but they make them evolve at but it doesnt really matter much since theres always everstones
pokemon,not_removed,yeah im not the biggest fan of megasalamences design but love its power im hoping for megaevolutions for arcanine feraligatr and torterra not expecting megaeeveelutions but im so scared that theyll look dumb too haha
pokemon,not_removed,poor things would probably have middlechild syndrome haha yeah when i was younger i usually preferred the cute starter and now i guess i usually only keep the middle if theres a good move they learn early on i do think that groyvle probably had the coolest design for a middleevolution starter
pokemon,not_removed,i would love for raichu flygon and gigalith to get mega evolutions that would be so great however at this point i think flygon getting a mega evolution is never gonna happen
pokemon,not_removed,agreed megaflygon would be cool but if they didnt introduce it in oras they probably wouldnt release it at all megaraichu would be great too ive seen some pretty good fanart for it being electricfighting
pokemon,not_removed,that would be way cool additionally two words mega vanniluxe we need more of that ice cream pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,and it has chocolate syrup with a cherry on top
pokemon,not_removed,dont forget the sprinkles also add a fairy typing to that beast
pokemon,not_removed,have you checked to see if its a fake
pokemon,not_removed,i bought it years ago and have used it successfully before on other games so its definitely not fake
pokemon,not_removed,oh ok in which case this might be a good question for httpswwwredditcomrgameboy

pokemon,not_removed,was a child dream years in the making to finally make it to the pokemon mega center i get so excited looking at this picture imagining receiving it myself when i was about years old the individually wrapped cards were not from the pokemon mega center they were from some of the many many multi story card trading shops from around tokyo
pokemon,not_removed,cute
pokemon,not_removed,nice it looks seriously awesome
pokemon,not_removed,thats pretty adorable
pokemon,not_removed,thats adorable
pokemon,not_removed,ohoh did you get it for the battle and brew meet up thing i was totally gunna get that design buti didnt wanna get up
pokemon,not_removed,yep it was definitely worth it
pokemon,not_removed,because eevee is the cutest
pokemon,not_removed,rpokemongiveaway
pokemon,not_removed,i think its a nod to gen where you could see a lot of undeveloped structures in game remember vermilion then in gold you return to a more developed kanto maybe youll return to alola and its all open and complete
pokemon,not_removed,yep many of us feel this way so much of the alolan region feels like it should have have things that were not there you get all excited about areas shown on the map and then you play the game and realize that buildings are emptyobstructedundeveloped or worse never built lookin at you empty lots those claims that its a nod to gen do these games honestly need any more nods to its literally drowning in references to gen and the dex has more kanto species than any other gens species even gen hopefully there is a version or sequels in production and hopefully theyll fix these things
pokemon,not_removed,i mean there were always inaccessible areas in every game houses with dummy doors fields behind fences etc
pokemon,not_removed,it would be cool to go into the golf course as a trial and face the elite girl in a sequel
pokemon,not_removed,id love for this to be a possibility to go back and have these areas open the incomplete structures and things in the distance behind fences didnt bother me it was just i dont know something about these felt off not sure if its because of how they look on the map or how they have the same appearance as other accessible entrances i think the power plant is just weird xd you go into the museum bit for it but no actual power plant theres this huge path and area for it on the map haha ah well ill just keep taking pictures through the fence hole
pokemon,not_removed,i remember those and they didnt bother me and the false doors in buildings in sunmoon dont bother me either inaccessible doors look different than the doors with mats in front that you can enter its the huge staircases and entrances going into further darkness that seem odd i love the thought though of exploring those areas if they are thinking of opening them up for future events
pokemon,not_removed,the first time i reached the power plant i thought the evil team wouldve take over like always lol so i understand your feeling i was like why did they put it there in the first place guess well have to wait and see
pokemon,not_removed,is it weird that i almost expected this to be nsfw
pokemon,not_removed,dammit i need some insulin
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,this is great ive been waiting for a proper wolf type pokemon forever and it looks like we finally got one and a werewolf themed one at that
pokemon,not_removed,furry alert
pokemon,not_removed,yes
pokemon,not_removed,no
pokemon,not_removed,jesus christ dont look at the rest of his gallery unless you want this picture ruined for you
pokemon,not_removed,yeah hope it actually has a cool new move instead of just counter
pokemon,not_removed,for some reason you can already tell the artist is a furry by the way he positioned the pokemon in this artwork and the paws
pokemon,not_removed,its the eyes always the eyes the more expressive a critters eyes are the more likely the artist does furry work not that theres anything wrong with it i find it a pretty interesting phenomenon that its so easy to recognize
pokemon,not_removed,have you tried heading to sunnyshore edit nevermind if you need the key this should help
pokemon,not_removed,did you go to the warehouse with the secret entrance to the hq or am i mistaken
pokemon,not_removed,ill try but sunnyshore is greyed out so i havent been there yet
pokemon,not_removed,i went to lake acuity but no one was there so i went to veilstone and the grunt is not outside and i still cant get inside the door
pokemon,not_removed,i am trying to get into the veilstone hq that says its an energy place
pokemon,not_removed,check and see if you have the master ball before that if you dont then you need to go through veilstone i edited in a link to my last reply try that
pokemon,not_removed,i dont have the masterball so where exactly in veilstone do i go
pokemon,not_removed,go to the north west of veilstone where you first come in from solaceon town there should be a warehouse there with a door you should be able to get inside from there
pokemon,not_removed,thank you it seems to be working ill keep you posted if something doesnt work you are a life saver
pokemon,not_removed,i found the key thank you
pokemon,not_removed,evs ivs natures and all that stuff isnt required at all i completely ignore it for my single player endeavours all i would do is have a type matchup chart available and learn what each of the stats mean from there just catch a pokemon that looks cool and train it until it gets good moves pokemon is a forgiving game
pokemon,not_removed,since gold and silver here are the biggest changes you need to know abilities every pokemon has an ability that affects the battle in a certain way for example many pokemon have the ability levitate that prevents damage from groundtype attacks but there are many many abilities to get accustomed to physicalspecial split this might not be a big change to you but if you didnt know already attacking moves have always been categorized into either a physical or a special move if a pokemon is hit with a physical move it takes damage based on how much defense it has if its hit with a special move the special defense stat is used instead up through generation a move was either physical or special based on what type it was so all firetype moves were specialbased all fighting and normal moves were physical etc gen changed this so that attacking moves could be physical or special regardless of type so now fire punch is physical hyper beam is special etc mega evolutions pokemon x and y introduced megas only certain pokemon can mega evolve but they get a huge boost in power for the duration of the battle and you can only mega evolve once per battle fairy type they introduced a new type fairy is strong against dark dragon and fighting while being weak to poison and steel natures this isnt that important unless you plan on battling competitively but every pokemon now has one of natures things like quirky adamant jolly that boosts a certain stat while decreasing another this is useful if you have a pokemon that is weak in a stat that you wouldnt be using anyways so you can buff their strong stat i dont know what all you already knew but these are the biggest points there are a ton of different changes but most of it you can figure out as you go along
pokemon,not_removed,breeding is a little more indepth we have a new type there are double triple and rotation battles and more i would recommend reading up on the newer games on serebiinet
pokemon,not_removed,there are sky battles meaning that only pokemon that have a flying type or levitate as an ability can battle horde encounters that let you battle of a certain pokemon theres also inverse battle where if a move is typically super effective on your pokemon it wont be very effective and vice versa meaning that grass is super effective against fire types
pokemon,not_removed,a really good video explaining evs and ivs its a little outdated since in sunmoon youll actually be able to train your ivs but its still a good starting point he has some more videos that might answer your other questions
pokemon,not_removed,on top of what others have mentioned already a few pokemon have had one of their base stats increased by points except for pikachu who gets two base stat increases in gen vi x and y a list of those pokemon and their respective boosts can be found httpserebiinetxyupdatedstatsshtml a few pokemon have either gained the fairytype or had its type replaced by fairy in gen vi pokemon like togepi clefairy and snubbull are fairytype now instead of normal which means they resist fightingtype moves instead of being weak to them and are now weak to poison and steel pokemon that gained fairy as a secondary typing have had their weaknesses and resistances changed the list of pokemon can be found httpserebiinetxyfairytypeshtml certain moves had had their base powers accuracies power point totals andor effects modified over the generations certain types gained buffs dark and ghosttype moves now deal neutral damage to steeltype pokemon as opposed to resisted damage ghosttype pokemon cannot be trapped by moves such as fire spin or abilities like arena trap trainers ghost types can run awayswitch out grasstypes are immune to powder moves such as stun spore spore sleep powder and poison powder fire electric ice and poisontypes are immune to burn paralysis freezing and poison status respectively
pokemon,not_removed,dont listen to anyone nothing changed and all the new information is just going to confuse you if not explained and slowly introduced to you which the games actually do if you just start playing it will be the easiest way to learn about all the new features essentially the game is the same as you know it to be turn based battles and evolving your mons leveling and catching differen species its an rpg so youll catch on dont worry about learning all the new stuff just play it like you used to and youll be introduced to the new stuff
pokemon,not_removed,ive heard of the fairy type not a huge fan of it at all but i suppose something had to be strong against dragon and dark types definitely didnt know about the physical and special moves though edit totally didnt know about natures though
pokemon,not_removed,what the hell inverse battles damn so much has changed good to see that the game is evolving though so a horde is like of yours vs of a certain kind
pokemon,not_removed,i wasnt too sure about the fairy typing at first but now i really love them besides balancing competitive play they really feel like they complete the types list basically its magic so its strong against dragons evil and simple fighters then again it can be tainted poison and forgotten by industrialization steel what really sold me was falling in love with a few fairy mons like togepi and whimsicott anyway hope you enjoy your pokeventures
pokemon,not_removed,so a horde is like of yours vs of a certain kind yessir theyre personally one of my favorite additions to the pokemon games
pokemon,not_removed,inverse battles are very rare and you really wont have to think about them the ones in xy were completely skippable and they might not even be in sumo
pokemon,not_removed,wow that actually makes a ton of sense
pokemon,not_removed,sumo i assume thats some kind of competitive battling
pokemon,not_removed,can i ask why you werent a fan of it at first im assuming it was mostly the name of it
pokemon,not_removed,sorry sun and moon its just the most common abbreviation so didnt think twice about using it
pokemon,not_removed,nah it wasnt the name i just wasnt a fan of the added type i mean it makes sense looking at jigglypuff and clefairy and togape my knowledge of pokemon names ends after lmao am i going to be able to somehow capture the old legendary pokémon zapados and whatnot and others obviously i want to catch them all but im not thinking they will be there
pokemon,not_removed,ah no its good most people dont know what i mean when i say pgo pokémongo
pokemon,not_removed,togepi was in gold and silver p xy doesnt have as many legendaries as omega ruby and alpha sapphire have the only ones in xy are the kalos trio xerneas yveltal and zygarde xerneas and yveltal are game specific mewtwo and the legendary birds while oras omega rubyalpha sapphire has pretty much all of the others that are catchable in game though some of those are game specific too
pokemon,not_removed,i know heshe was but it was a normal type not fairy haha they changed it to fairy type though didnt they im just not a fan of powerful looking dragons being taken down by something that looks like jigglypuff haha so ill have to somehow get the old versions on a ds and play them so i can get those legendary pokémon correct
pokemon,not_removed,omega ruby and alpha sapphire are remakes of the original ruby and sapphire and are games just like xy are httpwwwserebiinetxylegendaryshtml legnedary pokemon in xy httpwwwserebiinetomegarubyalphasapphirelegendaryshtml legendaries in oras
pokemon,not_removed,so those two games still take place in kanto i think thank you though i appreciate it
pokemon,not_removed,xy are in the kalos region which is loosly based on france oras are in the hoenn region sun and moon are in a new region the alola region which is based on hawaii
pokemon,not_removed,is there a reason they went from the darker themed pokemon to these more colorfulcartoony looking ones mimikyu seems like the only real dark and not the type one lol
pokemon,not_removed,i dont recall many older pokemon being darker themed really and the dark undertones in pokemon havent gone away at all there are some pokemon that are the souls of dead people and children as for the pokemon in sun and moon so far everything is heavily based on hawaii a colorful tropical island
pokemon,not_removed,so with these newer games do that just jam a ton of older version pokemon in it like they did with silver they had a large mixture of both is that how it works now or do they phase out the old ones can you actually catch the old starters because im not entirely thrilled about a fire cat over a fire lizard lmao
pokemon,not_removed,i guess what i more mean about darker themed was how cool they looked look a ghastly cyndaquil mewtwo gyarados i guess what im saying is look at how cartoony and silly the new ones kinda look compared to the old ones
pokemon,not_removed,in xy they do actually give you a choice of the original starters early on on top of the kalos starters but that was an exception not a common thing if you really wanted to go through with charizard you could probably find someone on this subreddit or the pokemon trading subreddit to give you a charmander
pokemon,not_removed,ah if thats the case long list ahead gen gen gen gen gen gen gen gen gen gen gen gen gen gen would put more but this is a bit time consuming lol
pokemon,not_removed,there we go thats what im looking for thank you so much
pokemon,not_removed,if you want to is a giant list of every pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,sorry to keep barraging you with questions but will this game continue with the shiny thing i always hear about
pokemon,not_removed,yup shiny pokemon have existed since gold and silver thats what the red gyarados in the lake was theyre pretty rare though even after they made them easier to get its a chance for a pokemon to be shiny when you run into one or hatch an egg
pokemon,not_removed,trade with the help of friends
pokemon,not_removed,trade gts friends rpokemontrades
pokemon,not_removed,pray to the wondertrade gods
pokemon,not_removed,cry
pokemon,not_removed,i also recommend rcasualpokemontrades as the names imply they are a lot more casual with the rules hacked pokemon are traded there sometimes but everyone is very upfront about what theyre offering so you can keep to legit only if you prefer that
pokemon,not_removed,gts like mad when bank launches
pokemon,not_removed,trade or wait for this gens next games whichll be at least years
pokemon,not_removed,at least years for the next games in this gen i wouldnt be surprised to see another set in the next year if theyre in the same gen the turnaround should be decently quick
pokemon,not_removed,the mimikyu is a nice touch
pokemon,not_removed,i really want to make salazzle work but shes too frail and just doesnt quite have enough umpgh to ohko much in this fairly bulky generation
pokemon,not_removed,vikavolt it hits like a fucking truck but its so over specialized in special attack it wont be able to get any attacks off without trickroom because of his god awful speed stat
pokemon,not_removed,mudbray as much as i love it and its an awesome pokemon i usually run pokemon with dual types so that i can get a good type coverage
pokemon,not_removed,i have problems to use some eevolutions first im not a competitive player which follows smogontiers and breed for the perfect ivs but i do follow the meta tendencies and make my movesets im saying this to show that maybe there are some good ways to use these guys that i unaware umbreon and flareon i really love their design really but they only work as batton passers which i dont quite like the idea to have a pokemon for this purpose alone their learnset couldnt be more limited the other eevolutions are good mainly glaceon which is one of my tr aces and vaporeon
pokemon,not_removed,umbreon is one of the best eeveelutions curse wish makes it super bulky usually using a mixture of toxic and protect to stall for a win
pokemon,not_removed,the only really good set ive seen for umbreon is like cursewishpaybacksomething else with the idea that since youre slower you always get the payback boost
pokemon,not_removed,i have questions ifunny
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,they had reboots if i remember one was the omniverse and a new reboot just named ben with a different art tbh it was an original idea the thing that brought then down was that they milked the series
pokemon,not_removed,absolutely loved the og show til it turned into a cancer of a series
pokemon,not_removed,and the new characters are just rehashes of the old ones grassfire or whatever its called idk is just like the other fire guy except hes green
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,try restarting your
pokemon,not_removed,i guess you miss out on a good story and the feeling of being introduced to the scaling exp mechanic after four generations of the flat exp mechanic i on reflection do enjoy having to only use generation pokemon until the end of the main story in bw
pokemon,not_removed,honestly some of my favourite games in the franchise black and white are probably actually my very favourite in the whole series
pokemon,not_removed,this needs to be here as an american who has lived in hawaii i can tell you that there are supermarket isles dedicated to only spam
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon has a set of unfortunately the source images were removed from imgur but the reddit post can still be read that touch on food inuniverse iirc the book details that any explicit form of meat is to be omitted vegetables however are fine ambiguous foods like sandwiches and onigiri are allowed since it doesnt explicitly show meat product spam might be an issue since its meat but since its status as meat is hilariously ambiguous it might get a pass id imagine seeing some kind of edit found the it states the food chain is not depicted in any way meat eggs and other animalbased foods eaten by humans in the real world are never shown although images of food should generally be avoided as long as no discernible animal product is featured then some food items are acceptable ambiguous foods such as rice balls or sandwiches are preferable pokémon food appearing in the tv animation is intentionally ambiguous
pokemon,not_removed,there was a fire fight but in all seriousness spam musubi and spam mcmuffins over there are amazing that and taropoi everything when i first landed and went out for food i was so confused as to why my burger and my wifes quesadilla arrived purple i thought the hour flight had finally driven me insane
pokemon,not_removed,came in thinking it would be about advertising or junk mail was going to make a joke about canned meat was surprised
pokemon,not_removed,wow did everyones response get deleted
pokemon,not_removed,i am literally watching boondock saints right now im at the scene were rocco argues with the random skanks why he killed there cat
pokemon,not_removed,i know im part psychic type
pokemon,not_removed,the lone survivor tell me your story
pokemon,not_removed,what happened this day
pokemon,not_removed,wat
pokemon,not_removed,for those who dont know this is surprisingly impressive
pokemon,not_removed,how 🤔
pokemon,not_removed,except the reward is still completely randomized fantastic luck though regardless
pokemon,not_removed,luck the balloons are calculated by luck along with the grafiti mini game besides legend dolls the other two are sort of skill based since the best prizes are still rarer than anything
pokemon,not_removed,random clicking and lots of praying to the rng gods
pokemon,not_removed,i got a leaf stone ddddddd kill me
pokemon,not_removed,earth type ha
pokemon,not_removed,water is blue cuaracao but normal is water k
pokemon,not_removed,that is one shitty pikachu
pokemon,not_removed,dart type
pokemon,not_removed,new sun and moon type confirmed
pokemon,not_removed,yeah my thought when seeing the board i complained about it nothing was done
pokemon,not_removed,id at least draw from reference and not memory it looks like something a school child would do
pokemon,not_removed,his uncle must be working at nintendo
pokemon,not_removed,deoxys is one of my top favorite legends alongside rayquaza giratina
pokemon,not_removed,illuminati
pokemon,not_removed,looks sweet man as a kid i was terrified by this creature its an alien with creepy hands i thought the movie was sweet but everytime that thing showed up i would close my eyes and the eyes but now i love the guy the attack forme is my favorite do you have a favorite forme op
pokemon,not_removed,would u me if my fave pokemon is mega rayquaza
pokemon,not_removed,me and you both deoxys is my favorite and giratina and rayquaza are a close and
pokemon,not_removed,the i love the most are meloetta celebi and and mew
pokemon,not_removed,well at least you got over your fear id say my favorite form is just the normal form but theres something i love about the rounded soft defense forme as well
pokemon,not_removed,flawless there are no holes with this theory
pokemon,not_removed,is coincidentally the number of sides a triangle has oh no not this again deoxys is the true illuminati pokémon stop alright fine your name is thespectatr thespectatr is two words but spaces arent allowed in reddit usernames the is letters and spectatr is pokémon have tri in their name dugtrio electrike manectrike zebstrika and eelektrik tri is the beginning of triangle the illuminatis symbol is guess what a triangle thespectatr is illuminati confirmed
pokemon,not_removed,no i wouldnt rayquaza and subsequently mega rayquaza is my favorite
pokemon,not_removed,i liked the defense forme aswell even as a kid it was the only one that didnt look scary or alienish amazing job you did on the drawing dude
pokemon,not_removed,it does have a nonthreatening feel to it thanks
pokemon,not_removed,watched it yesterday on the pokemon channel app i always cry every time
pokemon,not_removed,i watched it during the anniversary stream on twitch was surprised how hard the scene ash dies in hit me
pokemon,not_removed,you just reminded me of this i have to watch it soon i have a metric shit ton of pokemon vhs cassettes i gotta keep them and shove them down the next generations throats eventually
pokemon,not_removed,try rcasualpokemontrades
pokemon,not_removed,will do it but i also need help with my boldore and magmar
pokemon,not_removed,thank you
pokemon,not_removed,snape kills dumbledore
pokemon,not_removed,it allows me to draw two more cards from my deck and add them from my hand itsgoodtobegreedy
pokemon,not_removed,it allows you to use double battle format in a single battle format meaning you can double team a poor defenseless pokemon it also doubles as an interesting way to smoke weed
pokemon,not_removed,joey thats the pot of greed card it allows you to draw to cards from the top of your deck and add it to your hand
pokemon,not_removed,evil bong
pokemon,not_removed,it breaks the game
pokemon,not_removed,makes me want to eat it
pokemon,not_removed,its a mindless
pokemon,not_removed,i play pot of greed its effect allows me to draw two cards
pokemon,not_removed,it explodes when you try to remove your hand from inside of it at least thats what it says in the master guide
pokemon,not_removed,what does pot of greed do
pokemon,not_removed,its literally just a froakie probably a breedject
pokemon,not_removed,i know i worry a lot it kind of gets ridiculous sometimes but i always worry about having a fake pokemon ill bet he even just got the ditto from chaining on mount hokulani
pokemon,not_removed,how people quickly forget back in gen i dragon was a super secret type possessed only by one rare evolutionary line there was only one dragon type move that dealt damage and it was dragon rage which dealt a flat damage gen ii introduced a new dragon in kingdra albeit being related to a gen i evo line and finally introduced variable damage dragon moves like dragonbreath dragon moves were classified as special which kinda gimped their potential gen iii introduced a lot more dragon types and the first to not be related to gen i with flygon salamence and altaria all enjoying some level of popularity the dragon type increasingly came into prominence gen iv gave another boost with the physical special split allowing most dragons to use their better attacking stat for moves like outrage and dragon claw it introduced the powerful fan favorite garchomp gen v was pax draconis with a multitude of new dragons introduced in this gen older dragons got a lot of help too with salamence and dragonite gaining great hidden abilities dragmag teams ran rampant
pokemon,not_removed,dragon is a real type now while the last three generations psuedo legendaries have been dragon types tyranitar and metagross have set that they dont have to be dragons while originally it was this super rare type that tried to show elemental mastery there are weak dragon types like altaria and druddigon dragon is a type that exists on its own outside of baby pokémon dragon has real moves now and not just dragon rage there are dragon types that are easy to acquire and the type isnt exclusive to powerful rare pokémon dragon is a real type now and not a crown because of that dragon pokémon designs are better then ever
pokemon,not_removed,doesnt have any type that its super effective against besides itself still powerful typing
pokemon,not_removed,i bred and evlevel trained a goomy and now its a great specialty healer basically rain dancerest with the ability hydration i decided to pick flamethrower to counter ice types then i realised fire damage is halved in rain
pokemon,not_removed,jangmoo evolves really fast if you catch a wild one
pokemon,not_removed,dragons are one of my favorite types working on beast ball dragons right now
pokemon,not_removed,just as a sidenote you evolve goodra in rain but they are not wild
pokemon,not_removed,then fairies happened
pokemon,not_removed,druddigon hits like an wheeler
pokemon,not_removed,thats the thingit doesnt even need to trump another type
pokemon,not_removed,i love goomy goodra it can be a spdef tank with a rather powerful special attack which makes it a great fairy killer since it can survive moonblast and counter with sludge wave it isnt great against physical attackers but with the right movepool it has some great coverage also sap sipper is pretty good since it makes grass type moves non damaging also goodra is cute as hell which just makes me love it more
pokemon,not_removed,i still find that so stupid in the special demo you encounter wild jangmoo during the trial and a totem hakamoo in caret hill why cant we find one earlier on i traded with someone online to get one than breeded it to actually nickname it
pokemon,not_removed,username checks out
pokemon,not_removed,so does sunflora
pokemon,not_removed,dragon stab is useless though p much
pokemon,not_removed,yeah thinking of getting a poison move instead of flamethrower to counter fairy sap sipper would be absolutely beast on things like swampert but goodra already has a resistance for grass so its not extremely useful
pokemon,not_removed,spammed route for and a half hours to get my bagon as part of my core team that thing is a little beast
pokemon,not_removed,its far from useless extra power is always usefull p
pokemon,not_removed,pretty solid neutral coverage though
pokemon,not_removed,still has fewer resists than most types less so before the fairy type was introduced
pokemon,not_removed,but it does give an immunity to attacks like spore and leech seed
pokemon,not_removed,it hits virtually nothing flying stab would work better on hydreigon and latis for example if it wasnt for the dearth of good moves
pokemon,not_removed,missing steel is never a good thing and a heap of dragons cant hit it with their secondary either
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt know that lol
pokemon,not_removed,what flying stab on hydreigon and latis as in hitting them with it or using it on your main point dragon stab on mega charizard x is amazing as it hits everything that is resistant to fire either neutrally or supereffectively making only very specific type combos effective at countering it outrage stab dragon dance lum berry on multiscale dragonite is near unstoppable without an ice type especially as a battle spottree lead life orb draco meteor stab from latios hits almost everything in the metagame extremely hard dragon claw from garchomp is definitely something to respect dragon stab on mega salamence is great for the same reason although earthquake is a better option as it hits everything resistant to flying supereffectively
pokemon,not_removed,most dragons can carry earthquake or flamethrower if you really dislike steel types
pokemon,not_removed,im saying that if you gave them a different stab with the same power say a water clone of draco meteor then theyd do better
pokemon,not_removed,except the one that i use mostly
pokemon,not_removed,to each hisher own i like dragon as a neutral coverage option but you do not have to
pokemon,not_removed,ok i dunno which that is so youre gonna have to help me
pokemon,not_removed,i like the type its just that theres other stuff id prefer to use to neutrally cover water usually noivern and latias are two of my favourite mons
pokemon,not_removed,oh the lati twins
pokemon,not_removed,ah ok i guess you have access surf which hits most steels for neutral but yeah i can see the problem there resisting your stab typings
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i can sort of deal with most but running defog and the stabs leaves you with moveslot syndrome
pokemon,not_removed,also true
pokemon,not_removed,gonna be so mad if we cant use this form ingame your art is awesome
pokemon,not_removed,looks good d reminds me of the gurren lagann splash screens
pokemon,not_removed,this point has probably been made already but this thing really does remind me of a digimon
pokemon,not_removed,nice fakemon s
pokemon,not_removed,thanks thats the kind of thing i was going for im actually going to do a more ttglesque one soon
pokemon,not_removed,the thing has a mouth on its chest itll remind anyone of gurren lagann no matter who draws it
pokemon,not_removed,fakemon huh edit spelling
pokemon,not_removed,yup cant wait to attempt it
pokemon,not_removed,notice the s p
pokemon,not_removed,my bad mate i only glanced at it haha
pokemon,not_removed,its not available yet
pokemon,not_removed,youll need to wait a few weeks i hope my team gets unlocked soon
pokemon,not_removed,my teams been unlocked
pokemon,not_removed,i think rstunfisk might be a better place i would take out one of the weaker special attackers because necrozman is a special attacker
pokemon,not_removed,i would hate having half the unknown forms version locked good god man interesting idea though
pokemon,not_removed,you put remoraid and mantine in different games
pokemon,not_removed,in the original red and blue games version exclusives took up around of the pokedex by the time x and y came around the number of version exclusives compared to the regional pokedex dropped to considering that the pokedex is up to spoiler pokemon that would give a potential unique pokemon per dualversion games i was interested in trying to figure out what an almost exclusive pokedex would possibly look like this image is what i came up with i took in consideration alolan forms where entire lines were mirrored while branched evolutions were included in the same line version exclusive counterparts were kept in mind as well as generation counterparts while i do repeat some pokemon like basculin and unown for the most part in those cases its because theres exclusive abilities or alternate forms genderspecific lines such as meowstick or split evolution lines like lycanroc are kept intact except solgaleolunala and whereas there isnt a comparison for every single pokemon theres usually a counterpart that could be found somewhere in the other pokedex game thematic elements were also kept as close together as possible as for trading an entire pokedex from game to game yeah that would be a pain no matter how one would look at it pokemon bank would help a little but i agree that just linktrading would be a nightmare this idea is less about the feasibility of trading exclusive pokedex would be the easiest and more of seeing how to make each version almost completely different but keep the overall concept of pokemon found in the same routesareas i tried balancing pokemon that need stones to evolve happiness and mega evolutions but ultimately there will be slight imbalances in those regards
pokemon,not_removed,thats pretty sweet unique idea very well done
pokemon,not_removed,all eevolutions in one version breaks it for me
pokemon,not_removed,i think it would be cool if you got alternate forms if the pokemon was tradedevolved on a different game like alolan formes so you get a different type or something like a psychicflying noctowl
pokemon,not_removed,holy crap what hard choices but thats a good thing i was all for the left side bulba bros but steelix nidoking and swampert lines on the rigt have me second guessing also porygon on the right uugh breloom aggron kingdra on the left youve done a very good job at making both choices delicious
pokemon,not_removed,so which version would yall get
pokemon,not_removed,huh that is actually a really interesting idea i always buy both versions and this would make both playthroughs unique without me having to add some sort of restrictions like avoiding mons from my initial playthrough it would also be good if all the npcs stuck to pokemon exclusive to each version for more variability
pokemon,not_removed,very cool
pokemon,not_removed,youve split half of my favorite pokemon into each game well donenow i have to get both
pokemon,not_removed,someone should hack sun and moon to have this dex with moon on the right and sun on the left
pokemon,not_removed,i think maybe starters shouldnt be version exclusive or at least shouldnt be divided by generations some generation starters are much popular than others
pokemon,not_removed,theres something weirdly satisfying about staring at these and imagine what sort of regions theyd represent its a tough choice but id probably go with pokemon left version for a higher concentration of favorites
pokemon,not_removed,gona have to go with the right side 🔥
pokemon,not_removed,the fact that my two favorite pokemon are in different games annoys me however i love this concept
pokemon,not_removed,i take the left side why zubat is on the right
pokemon,not_removed,personally i would have put pyroar and luxray in different games due to similarities
pokemon,not_removed,huh you actually managed to split my team equally absol kingdra skarmory on the left eelektross sanslash and lucario on the right if this was a thing youd force me to make some hard choices on my team composition
pokemon,not_removed,oh man gotta go left dex mamoswine nidoqueen hydreigon
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon that have alolan forms only as their evolutions should be included in both imo thus what pikachu evolves into depends on the game like it is currently
pokemon,not_removed,where is g unown and chinchou lanturn
pokemon,not_removed,why is rotom grouped with the legendaries
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i was debating whether or not it would make sense if that happened since i decided to not versionlock other forms such as shellos silvally etc i decided to go with it even though yes it would be kind of frustrating i thought about the best way to split them also and couldnt really think of a good distribution pattern
pokemon,not_removed,the different dimensional plot thickens
pokemon,not_removed,mwahahahahahahaha
pokemon,not_removed,seriously this is like the most satanic list ive ever seen
pokemon,not_removed,likewise corsola and mareanietoxapex
pokemon,not_removed,yeah cant you get evee in every version so far
pokemon,not_removed,i always get both versions
pokemon,not_removed,naw i thought about making a sun dex and a moon dex but thatd be a whooooole other project haha
pokemon,not_removed,crobat is actually pretty good
pokemon,not_removed,gotta go right dragonite arcanine gyarados weavile
pokemon,not_removed,i thought about that like swapping a marowak form for an exeggutor form using them as counterparts but it would still be technically numerically the same that said sure why not it would make each game a little more exclusive than what it is now plus i got lazy after moving around pictures lol
pokemon,not_removed,where is g unown i had the same thought unown g is next to the unown o in version left it just doesnt look all that recognizable as a g compared to many of the other unown
pokemon,not_removed,five above d unown are chinchou and lanturn isnt that g unown on the left side
pokemon,not_removed,back in gen rotom was the last regular pokemon before legendaries this is a slight tribute to that
pokemon,not_removed,i think version locking half is a pain instead what you should do is have the alphabet in both but then make the and forms version locked
pokemon,not_removed,shellos would make sense though
pokemon,not_removed,one doesnt rely on the other to evolve
pokemon,not_removed,since gen ii iirc
pokemon,not_removed,good good with our combined might well bring the nations of that world to heel
pokemon,not_removed,found them sometimes i dont look hard enough i didnt know g unown looked like that i expected it to be capital
pokemon,not_removed,ah thats a good idea
pokemon,not_removed,which means not quite so relevant maybe say something like the mareanie line get swapped with the one of remoraid and mantine lines from the opposite side
pokemon,not_removed,you could get eevee in red and blue as well so gen i
pokemon,not_removed,but you cant breed it so you are stuck with only one eevolution
pokemon,not_removed,i misunderstood the question i think
pokemon,not_removed,open it up and play it of course you cant make an omelette without breaking some eggs
pokemon,not_removed,sell it and buy an opened one and a pokewalker
pokemon,not_removed,dude a mint pokewalker i still have mine not many people still do
pokemon,not_removed,probably put it up as a trophy for my descendants if i would have any to look at
pokemon,not_removed,i have an hg cartridge but i might open up an ss package just to play the game a bit honestly
pokemon,not_removed,rjizzycarts e nsfw
pokemon,not_removed,play it those games are my fav man
pokemon,not_removed,on the case comes sealed not the big box dont ask how i know lol
pokemon,not_removed,that looks like a pretty cool team also awesome drawing o
pokemon,not_removed,any one who loves poliwrath is fine by me
pokemon,not_removed,but thats a vibrava
pokemon,not_removed,i assume either bisharp or whimsicott was from bw and the other from
pokemon,not_removed,gotcha just was a little confused
pokemon,not_removed,its also because i actually think vibrava is cuter than flygon xd
pokemon,not_removed,ok do you want to play soul link
pokemon,not_removed,wait how isnt it pokemon related here is a playlist if u are unaware of a pokemon soul link
pokemon,not_removed,thats what resetting or buying the other version is for
pokemon,not_removed,delete your save and restart
pokemon,not_removed,i wanna see some background with the lookernanu relationship also lillie and gladions escapes and lusamine and guzma in the ultra space before the player arrived
pokemon,not_removed,type null and gladion background something with mohn and lusamine the reason why colress and grimsley are in alola whatever it may be anabel looker and nanu and the mysterious faller who died years prior just what is ultra space background on haus family why did his dad dislike being the son of a kahuna so much who even is he wheres haus mom lusamines father depiction of the battle between the tapus and the ultra beasts during ancient alola and also the one between the tapus and solgaleolunala just literally anything with my girl lillie the founding of team skull its said that it was created by a former kahuna who was struck down by the tapu but nothing more than that how did guzma come to lead it and its interesting that plumeria shows up in the trailer where that information comes from like someone else said guzma kukui and molaynes past
pokemon,not_removed,i want to see a flashback with a younger kukui guzma and maybe molayne if only because their pasts obviously have roots kukui and guzma especially and there was definitely an event where they drifted away
pokemon,not_removed,lillie doesnt matter if it is about her escape from aether foundation or even her changing into her zpowered form i just want to see her again
pokemon,not_removed,this may sound grisly but i want to see the mission where the faller died presumably heshe was eaten by guzzlord while the rest of the team watched on in horror its a really interesting story that was barely mentioned in the games and i want to see who it was and how it went down
pokemon,not_removed,if they were doing just three episodes like before id say these the scene in ultra space with the player lillie guzma lusamine nihilego and solgaleolunala the scene where the tapus and kahunas battle the ultra beasts professor kukui preparing the pokemon league just in time for the players arrival
pokemon,not_removed,lillie tries to get nebby in the bag
pokemon,not_removed,they need to release another one anyways since that last episode was lame and already seen
pokemon,not_removed,parental abuse going by how serious generations takes itself
pokemon,not_removed,the reason why colress and grimsley are in alola whatever it may be theyve eloped
pokemon,not_removed,and burnet
pokemon,not_removed,first time reading her diary after the post game really broke my heart
pokemon,not_removed,that was barely mentioned in the games i mean it gets a comparatively fair amount of dialogue and consumes two of the what six ub quest segments
pokemon,not_removed,grimsley gambled all away their finances and so now he and colress are working odd jobs around alola grimsley is a performer in malie citys sushi high roller thats why hes wearing a kimono probably and colress just kinda wanders around as a volunteer scientist no one really knows what that means not even colress himself
pokemon,not_removed,of the in any case its def lore that can afford to be developed
pokemon,not_removed,hes not doing a very good job making a living for the two of them then the times you see him he gives you expensive scientific equipment for free
pokemon,not_removed,i think what i meant was details about that mission consume two segments the first talks about the faller who died the second explains that they found anabel right after which is really the whole point not the other schmuck who got eaten what more is there to say anyway looker explained the essentials
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,i love cards with stories like this there should be many more of them than there are
pokemon,not_removed,what are the symbols on the sides of the cards
pokemon,not_removed,i have these cards framed too after i found all three i knew i had to keep them somewhere special because theyre so cool
pokemon,not_removed,there was a bulbasaur set in hoenn i wish i could remember what card set it was in they were throwing petals
pokemon,not_removed,great idea what series are the cards from but cant unsee it they dont look square im sorry
pokemon,not_removed,there were chespin cards i believe in steam siege that have a small story love it
pokemon,not_removed,that charmander has the same hp as the original mewtwo card
pokemon,not_removed,what frame did you use for those i wanna try making one
pokemon,not_removed,there was one with a family and the tepig line too was there
pokemon,not_removed,it just means there in the radient collection i believe i might be wrong but my friend is into comp tcg and thats what he told me
pokemon,not_removed,i believe the set may have been ex crystal guardians
pokemon,not_removed,the cards can be found in the generations collection
pokemon,not_removed,maybe its not the final product and i think the idea is the star here so what if its a little off if it makes them happy thats what counts
pokemon,not_removed,if you go on their app they have really good coupons too
pokemon,not_removed,its not power creep its called making stage actually usable
pokemon,not_removed,he could be doing research for someone
pokemon,not_removed,literally its him studying then becoming a researcher but the kid isnt the protagonist its the charmander that is he goes from picking on the kid to trying to help him achieve his goal
pokemon,not_removed,and a charmander and swablu bouffalant and natu as well oh and inkay and meowth
pokemon,not_removed,yeah ive seen that one friend of mine had all three cards but i think thats it the charizard line and the emboar line and no more but i could be wrong
pokemon,not_removed,thats it youre a legend mate thanks
pokemon,not_removed,its definitely power creep that charizard isnt even good
pokemon,not_removed,oh really what were they about if i can ask
pokemon,not_removed,ehh kinda i generally dont consider it power creep when its buffing an unused mechanic into something simi usable it might technically be power creep but it was for the right reasons making third stage pokemon simi usable and much more consistent
pokemon,not_removed,except this charizard isnt even semiusable by todays standards its terrible but its still objectively stronger than most old charizard cards so its definitely power creep
pokemon,not_removed,currently my beast ball collection ha avulpix ha eevee ha mareanie abra growlithe ribombee mimikyu beldum salandit smeargles i love the way the new ball looks just breeding it for ivsnatures but i wouldnt mind if i get that shiny
pokemon,not_removed,i have a iv gible in a beast ball if you want to trade for a clonebreedject of the ha vulpix pm me
pokemon,not_removed,beast balls not so much trying to put legendaries in those for the moment well i was before i decided to take a break from the games for my sanity but since theyre shinylocked theyre placeholders anyway my real goal is perfect pokemon in luxury balls real ivs good nature ideally female not a team of them mind you a pokedex full of them may end up waiting for gen to see if it improves the way ballsivsetc are handled because this is way too timeconsuming and really not much fun as it stands and im currently sitting at an impressive
pokemon,not_removed,dude go to rbankballs they trade different colored balls including beastballs you can fill the collection quick
pokemon,not_removed,currently trying to get a iv vulpix with freezedry encore and moonblast once im done that ill try for a trifecta deino using the beast ball deino and the iv ditto i have i have absolutely no hope for a shiny though
pokemon,not_removed,im doing something similar but breeding some perfects on the side while i do it
pokemon,not_removed,the only thing i beast balled was a magikarp it took seven tries how are people catching so many things in them
pokemon,not_removed,dude go to rbankballs they trade different colored balls including beastballs you can fill the collection quick
pokemon,not_removed,grats thats an awesome collection i have a bunch of riolus with nontimid natures and nonshiny now because of the shiny hunt lol in general i totally agree just breeding for the beast balls and nature iv is more than good enoughits really just my favorites and a few of the alolan pokemon id like to get the quadfecta for eventually likely will take months its definitely awesome enough to settle for a nonshiny trifecta lol p
pokemon,not_removed,ill pm you i have plenty of vulpixes lol can trade tomorrow as im off to bed now p
pokemon,not_removed,whoa yeahthats like a quinfecta for you and definitely the more layers we tack on the more brutal the grind getsi wish you luck man i did catch necrozma in a beast ball but thats it as far as legendaries are concerned i didnt bother with the tapus i wish you luck at changing that to at least a few in the notsodistant future
pokemon,not_removed,youve described my eevee evolution collection minus the shiny part
pokemon,not_removed,oh damn you da real mvp 👌
pokemon,not_removed,i have beast balls left ended the storyline with i usually just save before an area i intend to farm certain pokemon at and sr if i use too many otherwise gts your way to a beast ball collection and breed your ownmuch more efficient this way and a lot less frustration involved p
pokemon,not_removed,dude go to rbankballs they trade different colored balls including beastballs you can fill the collection quick i know id breed one of mine and trade you for a magikarp
pokemon,not_removed,beast ball lucario is awesome and i will definitely add to the list when i have the time im a tad obsessed with the new ball and the fact that anything other than an ultra beast will be harder to catch is a challenge im more than up for lol
pokemon,not_removed,would you happen to have anymore im trying to get a timid riolu in a beast ball but the ditto i caught with the beast ball wont breed with anything
pokemon,not_removed,frick sorry im high rbankballexchange
pokemon,not_removed,an empty sub ill keep it in mind if i ever feel like ruining the challenge
pokemon,not_removed,oh shit sorry im high bankballexchange anyway you dont have to dude its just a suggestion sheesh
pokemon,not_removed,there are definitely dirty jokes that are hidden to kids that only adults get but i dont think this is one of them i think this is just more of a cute toy
pokemon,not_removed,no its not a dildo joke this is just reaching
pokemon,not_removed,no i think its just supposed to be a cute toy
pokemon,not_removed,theyre not really vibrating theyre just kinda moving back and forth it is weird that they specified single women but still not exactly a weird vibrating fuckbear
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon has a couple dirty references in each game for the older fans to understand
pokemon,not_removed,i seriously doubt that was the intention you kind of have to force it to make the reference work
pokemon,not_removed,its a reference to how single women cuddle with their teddies since they dont have a significant other to cuddle nothing sexual going on here the vibrating is just a function of how the toy is capable of moving
pokemon,not_removed,you just posted online that youre thinking about sex in a kids game
pokemon,not_removed,i think this was just an oversight by the programmers or writers i know they make mature jokes but i just cant see them putting a vibrating dildo shaped like a pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,yes but across the series there are many just some examples old man at celadon gym a couple npc uses an onix cloyster hiker at the ferris wheel in bw some npcs at the battle towertreefactory etc
pokemon,not_removed,i got more of a single catlady vibe i also recently bought a lot of pokemon plush since pokemon center came back online so it felt like it was directed to me and girls that own stuffed animals as well her bed is the same as the one that came with my sublet soim not single though
pokemon,not_removed,compared to making the mallow special that is pretty much nothing
pokemon,not_removed,lol
pokemon,not_removed,ooooohhhhh my
pokemon,not_removed,i think the single women was sort of a reference to cat ladies
pokemon,not_removed,haha pokemon went from catching them all to weird vibrating fuckbears pretty damn quickly lol
pokemon,not_removed,im if that makes things better dont get the wrong image its just i noticed something game freak puts stuff in these games anyway like the celadon old man
pokemon,not_removed,that made me laugh so hard i wish i could give gold
pokemon,not_removed,i have bad news for you if you think thats an uncommon thing on the internet
pokemon,not_removed,onix is he having trouble getting it all the way up
pokemon,not_removed,turn it to goo
pokemon,not_removed,fair enough at least youre not one of those guys who laugh at simple things like dick lul so funny
pokemon,not_removed,you have to be to be on reddit dude
pokemon,not_removed,what do you think
pokemon,not_removed,yeah well weve all lied about our age and im sure you dont know my address i consider myself a bit more mature than my peers locally at least so maybe thats something not trying to sound vain lol
pokemon,not_removed,thats still breaking reddita rules
pokemon,not_removed,call the police on him
pokemon,not_removed,i think it may be illegal as this site is only for teenagers or older but contacting rpokemon mods is probably the best idea i cant because im on mobile but i will in a sec sorry op
pokemon,not_removed,i was just kidding dude hes a kid on the pokemon reddit just leave him alone
pokemon,not_removed,cheers bro i didnt expect this fuss lol maybe should have kept it quiet that im underage if i get banned or whatever ive got a few more emails so ill be fine ha
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure they can see your ip address could be wrong though
pokemon,not_removed,ah yeah shouldve thought of that oh well ill be aloud legally on soon enough i suppose for now though ill just make the most of this while i can
pokemon,not_removed,sorry dude just read the httpswwwredditcomhelpuseragreement next time
pokemon,not_removed,cheers
pokemon,not_removed,says the second code is incorrect
pokemon,not_removed,the third and fourth dont work
pokemon,not_removed,thanks man
pokemon,not_removed,did you get one i have extra
pokemon,not_removed,the code didnt work for me i think it might be that the codes arent from na id appreciate it if you sent me one
pokemon,not_removed,sorry mine is from eu so it probably doesnt work
pokemon,not_removed,wally was never and will never be my rival but i was his
pokemon,not_removed,the majority of rivals always seem to pop out of nowhere and challenge you out of the blue i see what you unintentionally did there ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
pokemon,not_removed,i think his deveopment was done a little better than before and thats why people are all wally fanboys he was more i dunno then he was i guesss we should do dis but uncle says no then finnaly randomly he was all im here and im good fight me im greatest thats not really development but its better than before which i think is why people are praising him its because they were always deprived of any character development so when wally comes along with his ounce of character development everyone loses there shit
pokemon,not_removed,conversely i think wallys position as a rival symbolizes a major development in the lives of the player in particular for the players who grew up playing gen i and ii already and were now playing gen iii wally is never really a challenge to the player in the main game of rse or oras his final fight takes a little work but if youve been leveling your pokemon well its easy to beat but now imagine from wallys perspective those battles are tough wallys just a sick kid and youre the sondaughter of a gym leader when he challenges you he knows he probably doesnt stand a chance but hes exhilarated just to have the opportunity of battling you heck when you first have the catching tutorial its framed not as wally teaching you how to catch but the other way around this shift in rivals represents that the audience of pokemon that were sticking around for the new games had grown and were now more experienced they understood battling because they had done it before wally is a way of acknowledging this development at the same time wally is also representative of a player the audience of new players that rse brought in who didnt know how to catch pokemon yet and didnt know the type match ups that well the presence of wallys character arc alongside the main character reflects a passing of the torch as the audience that grew up playing the previous pokemon games continued to grow older and many of them stopped playing but wally was there a new player a new audience ready to take their place
pokemon,not_removed,wally did things behind the scenes you may notice that every gym past wattson has been beaten by him before you wally was certified cool at his victory road battle for me and then when he just barreled right through team aqua like it was nothing then he was badass edit also wally had literally no canon way to get a magnezone in oras to evolve magneton you have to level it up at new mauville a location that is only available postelite four and the key is only given to the player character anyway
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt think of any of the hoenn kids as rivals to be honest wally was always ineffectual and maybrendan are too chummy dont really contribute much and drop off the map at a certain point i prefer rivals to be kinda antagonistic like blue or silver and im not overly fond of the trend of your rivals being your best friends you wanted to beat blue because he was a dick constantly sweeping wally just feels like bullying after a certain point
pokemon,not_removed,i would never call him a rival just a supporting character that you battle but i really disagree with you on his development he only shows up a few times yeah but i definitely could feel the differences in his character at the end
pokemon,not_removed,trevor and shauna have their fans probably because they actually received some degree of development during x and y but motherfucking tierno is probably the nadir of every rival in the series at least every member of wallys team actually have full movepools in their final battles
pokemon,not_removed,i always thought you were wallys mentor ever since you meet him when he catches ralts and you battle him every once in a while to check on his progress as a trainer hes far from being a rival i wouldve loved it a lot if maybrendan didnt quit battling you as soon as you reached lilycove city and at least appeared in the pokemon league lobby as an optional fight before taking on the elite four
pokemon,not_removed,i think part of it is that in the original rse if i remember right brendanmay never even use their final starter evo against you they justquit wally being the one to show up at the end of victory road as the true rival was amazing at the time however with the additions to oras benefitting brendanmay more it makes wallys surprise appearance at the end a littleless cool than it used to be they ramped up the atmosphere they changed the song but the whole point was that he was supposed to be the last rival fight back in the day and now hes not so the whole affair feels kind of overdone this is when it turns out im wrong and there was aways another battle with the main rival in rse i love wally i have always vastly preferred him to brendanmay but i definitely see your point here he could have been done so much better at least his battle resort team is i heard badass im not a maisonplayer myself so havent taken him on
pokemon,not_removed,brendanmay is the only rival in rseoras there ive said it
pokemon,not_removed,wally is the definition of overrated there was literally nothing note worthy about him in rse in fact i forgot he even existed until oras and oras didnt do much to make him better he is a complete bore and really brings oras down
pokemon,not_removed,maybe its just me but honestly ive always found wallys alarmingly fast growth kind of charming it almost makes it seem as if he too is a pokemon prodigy and the fact that he has a more sympathetic story than any other playable character topped with the fact that your one of the people he looks up too really just make him feel like a very unique and refreshing rival to me i understand that you acknowledged that i do agree that the actual battle itself doesnt live up to the hype surrounding it though
pokemon,not_removed,i thought wally was a great rival honestly
pokemon,not_removed,this is just a post in response to the earlier post today praising wally as a rival and saying how his theme was the best you could have just put your rant in that post
pokemon,not_removed,i agree i was never a fan of wally he felt very forgettable especially in rse i swear they couldve just left him out of the remakes and no would have said a thing since we would have all forgotten he existed in the first place and hastily written in his oras edition alright guys this game is complete all we gotta do now is wait until tomorrow to ship out fuck wait we forgot that green haired kid quickly what can we change in as little time as possible right about the theme too i dont like it all its fine for an encounter theme but i dont get why it has to go into the battle theme it might sound good for the first few minutes but then it just drags on and gets boring after minutes plenty of better themes out there cynthias battle frontier and ect i dont hate him i just think hes forgettable and hastily written along with the mentioned friends in xy
pokemon,not_removed,i totally see where youre coming from and thats a valid opinion these are critiques to be had of how his character was handled even when i first played rse i didnt really realize wally was supposed to be a rival in any form so youre right there and i agree with you about showing the characters a bit more i like that in recent games the rivals have been more onscreen than off though i felt gen flopped on the whole character development thing as a whole to me though i actually liked how he kind of came out of nowwhere you didnt see a lot of the development but i kind of thought it was a nice touch of wow where did this come from and what was he doing all this time to get to this point because the player is left to his imagination plus it was kind of a twist because the pokemon fan club in lilycove talks about an up and coming trainer and you think is that me is that the eldest son of the family of trainers outside mauville and then nope at victory road its wally that appearsand then it hits you its him
pokemon,not_removed,yea lol i remember replaying oras and not really being blown away by his theme like the first time i heard it when i noticed that it looped for the first time i was just like that was it not really a great theme honestly compared to other wobbles
pokemon,not_removed,not a fan of him but did you check his battle maison team spoilers
pokemon,not_removed,im over all the tough guy rivals id rather have shauna tierno and trevor who meet not just to battle but to do stuff together its just battles win lose who cares xy finally makes good of what the games have been telling you for the past years that friendship and bonds are whats important
pokemon,not_removed,i agree with some of this but how dare you say his victory road encounter was easy in emerald especially my pokemon game i remember him trashing me many times
pokemon,not_removed,and then theres the true final battle with him where he ditches all the useless pokémon in favour of beasts like garchomp and gale wings talonflame
pokemon,not_removed,i agree with you wally is not your rival he barely manages to be a character i could care about he just a sad try hard i dont think anything he does is relevant to the player liking his character or even caring for him they do show he grows but it is very vague pokemon has to try to make a character who actually challenges you
pokemon,not_removed,i agree with you and pretty much everyone back during the gen iv days would agree with this too in rse wally didnt really seem like a rival he just felt like an npc that had some development in oras it was pushed a bit further but i didnt feel it was too much i was disappointed that wally didnt have a fully evolved team considering you have the national dex and even then the sinnoh evolutions for hoenn pokemon are in the hoenn dex and good lord his battle theme was underwhelming it was too short and felt more like an encounter theme this is part of why oras were disappointing remakes as they had so much potential im ready for the downvotes from you wally fans but i would never consider wally your typical rival
pokemon,not_removed,is this cause of my post
pokemon,not_removed,ive always hated wally with a burning passion i never really had a reason why i just did i was opening some booster packs a few days ago for the first time in like years and i got a wally trainer card so i threw it out the window on the car ride home i hate wally and now that you wrote this post i have even more reasons to
pokemon,not_removed,i have no rival
pokemon,not_removed,you can get magnezone before the elite i did you can level your magneton up in the area before the gate
pokemon,not_removed,actually this has bugged me for a while when did wally get all the gym badges everyone asks really did you forget everything you had to do that was not getting the gym badges wally was not taking on gangs breaking into said gangs hideout flying back and forth between the region beat a gym traveled across the ocean took on a large cave filled with more gangs members battled an ancient pokemon and saved the world pretty sure that would have taken a few days so yeah plenty of time for wally to skip ahead of the player
pokemon,not_removed,its not post its after defeating kyogre source did it
pokemon,not_removed,most people dont check the gym signs anymore though and even if one did check them the typical reaction would be oh wallys taking on the gyms good for him even still we dont really see him and therefore we dont see his character growth when we see him for the first time in awhile at victory road his whole character arc is all bark and no bite maybe if a couple times before going into a gym wally appears and says oh youre challenging the gym good luck i beat it just a little bit ago along with something profoundand maybe even a quick battle it wouldve helped a lot also level hydreigon there would be no problem with wally having a magnezone
pokemon,not_removed,oh yes this is a good point i never liked the were buddies lets you murder my fire type with your water even though i have an electric but i wont switch out because were buds i want them to a complete asshole so it feels like justice not depriving a small child of self esteem
pokemon,not_removed,op is not saying that theres not a difference in character at the end but rather that the change is not earned they dont lay the groundwork for it we dont see the development in action i dont mean that as a criticism its an interesting strategy for characterization his absence leaves a lot up to the imagination wally was on his own pokémon journey just like you it was his own and didnt revolve around yours the way some other rivals lives have
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i couldnt call wally a rival myself maxie is more of a rival than wally
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i really liked the xy rivals you just have to not see shauna tierno and trevor as rivals trevor even makes it clear that hes not doing the journey for the battling and shauna and tierno only battle because they think its fun calemserena is the only actual rival in those games oh and the rival battle theme from xy was the shit one of the best battle themes there are those subdued guitar riffs
pokemon,not_removed,when wally showed up at the end of my first ruby run through i barely knew who he was
pokemon,not_removed,not in rse lol theyre pathetic there
pokemon,not_removed,no i actually was planning this post for at least a month that post was just the catalyst i guess
pokemon,not_removed,stop bringing up downvotes and you wont be downvoted ffs
pokemon,not_removed,i thought it was an encounter theme it just played throughout the battle with him isnt that right
pokemon,not_removed,i had planned to post something like this for some time now i guess your post was kinda the catalyst
pokemon,not_removed,ah my mistake
pokemon,not_removed,the thing about it is the whole time you never knew wally was even meant to be your rival he tried to sputter out the word in your second meeting but every time its may who shows up to challenge you periodically youre expecting your rival at victory road and its him standing there his carefree generic encounter theme becomes a guitar riff surrounded by a bed of flowers blues the only rival with a comparable twist
pokemon,not_removed,but his absence is exactly why hes not a rival because he doesnt parallel you at all he doesnt rival you blue is one step ahead of you at all times and you see it everywhere check the gym signs blue beat you to it go through a major dungeon like ss anne or pokemon tower or silph co hes there waiting for yo a rival is supposed to be on the same journey as you otherwise theyre not a rival just a character who returns
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know i was scared shitless of the route encounter
pokemon,not_removed,your post is really not that long saying you spent more than a month on this just sounds ridiculous even if it were true i call bs
pokemon,not_removed,make no mistake any controversial opinion of any kind will get downvoted by at least someone its the nature of reddit circlejerking
pokemon,not_removed,thats what i thought but the soundtrack has it listed as battle wally so its a battle theme
pokemon,not_removed,i guess sorry if i seemed pushy there everyone has their opinions
pokemon,not_removed,no problem
pokemon,not_removed,if we werent even supposed to know wally was a rival then that doesnt really make him a good rival now does it
pokemon,not_removed,good point maybe rival isnt a good word for wally
pokemon,not_removed,thats fair but they are also the only rivals to not have a climactic final battle
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt have a tab open for a month i just held the thought hey maybe i should make a post about how i dont like wally in the back of my mind i knew the whole time what i was going to say i just lacked motivation i dont normally make reddit posts on a whim i like to think about what i post before i post it
pokemon,not_removed,you underestimate the power of procrastination
pokemon,not_removed,it makes him a different rival its like if lysandre were to be revealed as the leader of team flare and it wasnt blatantly obvious if you could use a fraction of your brain is wally a good rival perhaps not but in this generation the job of rival was split in two that makes it different from blue silver barry bianca cheren hugh or the four asshats from x and y isnt it nice to have a little change every now and then
pokemon,not_removed,i think what hes more saying is that blue was there at all major places to remind you here he is this dickbag that no one likes im going to sweep his team wally is more of a small child your whipping not a jerk who thinks hes superior
pokemon,not_removed,oh believe me i know everything about procrastination having my own problems with it right now it doesnt make any sense to wait with this kind of stuff if you actually enjoy discussion around pokémon procrastination happens with chores and other important things not hobbies and things you enjoy i seriously cant be the only one who thinks this guys excuse is really far fetched right
pokemon,not_removed,yeah change is good but im not too fond of the idea of getting to the end of the final stretch of the game and then the game telling me remember him hes your rival now
pokemon,not_removed,you should have waited a month to post that reply
pokemon,not_removed,i cant exactly tell the scale but id say be careful with plants in small pots they can become rootbound and die if they get too big looks awesome
pokemon,not_removed,you are right that is oddish
pokemon,not_removed,does it need a lot of sunlight
pokemon,not_removed,this is so cute d
pokemon,not_removed,its oddishish
pokemon,not_removed,i would think theyd put the mega evolution button there instead
pokemon,not_removed,thats where the mega evolution button goes though
pokemon,not_removed,take note this is an edited image not real
pokemon,not_removed,both can go there its common sense by that i mean those who can gain the move will have this and those that can mega evolve will have the button there
pokemon,not_removed,those who can gain the move will have this and those that can mega evolve will have the button there
pokemon,not_removed,what about pokémon that can do both theres no way theyre going to value a move slot as highly as the entire mega evolution concept so dont count on them just forcing both buttons in there like they were equal mechanics
pokemon,not_removed,hm so how would a pokémon get a move slot do you think i know no one knows since its not even confirmed yet just curious as to what you think they might do
pokemon,not_removed,and those who gain a move wont ever be able to mega evolve or what theres no way a feature so small as a move is going to trump mega evolution and they most definitely arent equal mechanics either so dont count on them having two buttons as if they were either
pokemon,not_removed,what makes you think a pokemon can do both the ones who gain move would be separate from megas
pokemon,not_removed,by using the new bracelets probably like megas it wont be a permanent thing
pokemon,not_removed,the idea is that in addition to the move the pokemon would also gain a stat boost that rivals megas unleashing their true power through a bond or whatever ive seen people reference it to the special move plus stat boost ash greninja receives im not saying i think this will be a feature either way just clarifying all the details
pokemon,not_removed,thats because gaining a move will be part of a new evolution mechanic in itself so you gain a super powerful move stat boost so it doesnt fall behind megas in strength and now you can change up your entire moveset strategy since you now have moves thats pretty big
pokemon,not_removed,which is where this entire idea falls apart gaining a move is nothing compared to mega evolution there is simply no way gamefreak is ever going to value something that small over they current marketing bread and butter
pokemon,not_removed,hm thatd be interesting but it seems odd theyd throw another major new mechanic in just one generation after megas were introduced id think theyd be expanding mega evolution instead but who knows
pokemon,not_removed,whos to say that a theoretical move wont be like dragon ascent but instead of just making it so a pokemon ala rayquaza can mega evolve the move itself would be the catalyst for some sort of transformation ala satoshigreninja while pokemon that can mega evolve will just mega evolve the legendaries hint at such move transformations
pokemon,not_removed,actually its pretty huge and can really change up how you can play a pokemon that and if the pokemon gains a stat boost while this move is activated it can rival megas seriously ask any of the good players or look it up how much a move can make a difference
pokemon,not_removed,to be honest they can do both in terms of lore we already got that covered and we know everything so far in terms of how it works we got that down too so really its okay to implement something new alongside megas at this point
pokemon,not_removed,that doesnt matter from gamefreaks point of view though a move is nothing but that a move it doesnt change the pokémon itself mega evolution however is something they can market themselves on and milk for years by spitting out new evolutions and designs for already existing pokémon including those that already have achieved their maximum number of evolutions they can even provide multiple new evolutions to popular pokémon to truly reel in the cash like they did with charizard and mewtwo the two most popular gen i pokémon
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i suppose it just feels like a lot all at once you know anyway no matter what it is im sure well get used to it soon enough i never thought id get used to megas but im pretty good with them now lol
pokemon,not_removed,well if the evolution looked along the lines of this httpwwwserebiinetpokkencharactersburstweavilejpg or this or this im sure it can sell besides its not like megas will be dead after this anyways also you want an example of how big it can be watch this he explains it better than i could
pokemon,not_removed,then why the hell would the professor of the region be researching something as mundane as pokemon moves instead of some big brand new mechanic like all the old professors what with them researching eggs new evolutions for old pokemon mega evolution etc
pokemon,not_removed,theres the good way of thinking
pokemon,not_removed,you mean giving them a white or red glow that they cannot make merchandise off or make ashgreninja anyway even though they said it would stay in the anime the feature itself may be great i have no doubt it would but it simply isnt likely there is absolutely nothing that hints at such a feature in any way other than the first move in the inbattle switchin movesummary screen having a broader boundary box than the four others its such a tiny mundane detail that could be explained in a thousand other ways there is absolute no links between what weve actually seen which is nothing but a single selection box in a single picture to what youre speculating about right now the link does not go that far
pokemon,not_removed,maybe it is because of a big brand new mechanic like mega evolutions one that requires the gemstones the protagonists wear on their bracelets and not just a ordinary attacking move that doesnt change anything about the pokémon itself
pokemon,not_removed,and again professor kukui studies which hints that moves will play a big role in the games plus those arent glows thats weavile actually going through something similar to ashgreninja but instead parts of its body in frosted over with ice same with machamp its skin turns boiling red and has steam constantly coming off of it theyre not as big of changes as megas but theyre still changes that they can market off of
pokemon,not_removed,yeah thats what i was getting at sorry if i didnt make that clear
pokemon,not_removed,that cubone is absolutely gonna evolve into an alolan marowak calling it
pokemon,not_removed,this songs freaking me out because all i can hear is eren yeager from aot
pokemon,not_removed,sorry but this aint fresh
pokemon,not_removed,this has been out for weeks
pokemon,not_removed,thats very likely it would make for a good way to show the characters about these strange evolutions whoever the owner of that cubone is will probably bring alola up saying that theyre from there
pokemon,not_removed,agreed
pokemon,not_removed,is out and it didnt shameee shame for the rest of the thread that downvotes peeps that correctly predicted it didnt happen too you earned it
pokemon,not_removed,i highly doubt it pretty sure ashs first introduction to alola mons will be the sun and moon anime thats why hes going to school
pokemon,not_removed,sorry
pokemon,not_removed,sorry
pokemon,not_removed,uh youre forgetting something important one cant evolve into alolan form if theyre not on alolan territory debunked
pokemon,not_removed,they have a history of showing off pokémon from the newlyrevealed generation in the anime season that comes before it
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think so hes most likly alolan decent so he has the genetics of the regional variant of marowak after watching this im sure he will become alolan marowak through evolution
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,i know but not always they didnt show anything from
pokemon,not_removed,from serebii due to the different microclimates in the alola region various pokémon have become different to how they are in other regions these are known as alola forms so without that microclimate that took place as special evolution prequisites like moss stone or ice stone they wont be able to evolve into alolan form unless the shitty producers uses the miare city has the sundial that pairs with moondial in alola that gives limited kind of pokemon to evolve without being in alolan region or miare city is the closest place in kalos region to alola region in which we riot also good try bringing genetics in here which we know does not have any relation with evolution eevee could evolve in eight ways and eggs only passes the species of the mother alolan vulpix could only be bred on alola even if you brought a normal vulpixninetales from outside of the region using trade likewise breeding alolan marowak would only produce a normal cubone that would not evolve into alolan marowak should it be brought outtraded to older games there is however a chance this would happen taken from the flavor text also based serebii the marowak in the alola region take bones and light both ends on fire by rubbing them against their foreheads then they spin the bones around marowaks rarity and its fearsome appearance when it dances with its bone led the people of alola to dub it a conjurer and regard it with fear there are many grasstype pokémon—marowaks natural enemies—in the alola region this makes alola a harsh environment for cubone and marowak as a result they live in close union with their partners its said that their great care for their partners allowed them to gain something like a sixth sense and resulted in their changed form the alolan marowak proves skilled at an attack in which it waves its bone and releases a ball of flame the fireballs are not that powerful but they tirelessly pursue the foe so probably the producer would take that part disregarding the alola region perquisite and make that cubone evolves when its facing chespin classic gameplaystory segregation thing like why thundershock works against onix
pokemon,not_removed,weavile bonsly munchlax mime jr and lucario appeared prior to sinnoh and zorua and zoroark also a woobat on a hat appeared prior to unova
pokemon,not_removed,tldr
pokemon,not_removed,when i said i meant going from sinnoh to unova those you mentioned were all in a movie and we got magearna for gen
pokemon,not_removed,thats still an appearance in the anime before their generation no
pokemon,not_removed,yes but to that extent i believe magearna is the only gen mon well see
pokemon,not_removed,i know i aint the only one that threw all their money on clothing rip raichu on a different note here are standalone pics i did of that trainer because people liked her
pokemon,not_removed,okay lets be real as soon as they added fashion i spent more time accessorizing than actually playing the game
pokemon,not_removed,i see you wasted the pokedollars looker gave you xd
pokemon,not_removed,ha all i wanted was a damn skull tank and the alligator shoes next to the thrift store my character was stylish af after that
pokemon,not_removed,when i win the league i need to do so in style though i wish there were more clothing options for boys maybe i want to wear big flannel in alola maybe a small sweater would be nice in the icy mountains
pokemon,not_removed,lets be real raichu wasnt gonna survive that full health
pokemon,not_removed,cant view on mobile because the link was to tumblr and not the pic itself im sure its great though
pokemon,not_removed,this is why i regularly restock on max potions and full heals before i think about buying clothing to make myself look like a walking pomegranate
pokemon,not_removed,i did do a lot of buying i had scene outfits for each and every scene sea tank and shorts to look like a tourist a skirt and a purple blouse for others po town i had ripped jeans and a black shirtstrappy sandles for stealth aether foundation i wore frills to rep my girl lillie and the league i had ripped jeans a stripey tank and a new handbag i liked fully immersing into the story and thought why not go for different outfits at every chance possible since a lot was going on i basically had a new outfit at every challenge kept the same haircut though short and wavy through out the game even do different outfits for battle spot time and battle tree i even have a shiny hunting outfit my skull tank black mini skirt black cap and sneakers xd if i bought it might as well have fun
pokemon,not_removed,holy shit this comic is great and every page feels like a new style of art great job
pokemon,not_removed,i need healing
pokemon,not_removed,girls get sandals god dammit why dont guys its hawaiinothawaii ffs
pokemon,not_removed,see i had tons of money mostly cause i used the boy and the outfits to me were all really really bad silly tshirts and tank tops nothing really cool looking i mean there were a few but i liked xys clothing more here i just felt really really casual looking
pokemon,not_removed,never used a potion before the league so i just used all the ones i found along the way and the ones that lillie gave me no sweat all my pokémon were thrilled to bits
pokemon,not_removed,accurate
pokemon,not_removed,is that the pokemon go gym arena
pokemon,not_removed,raichus kidding itself if it thinks it could take on snorlax even at full hp p
pokemon,not_removed,i set a budget but only for potions while i splurge the rest for clothes cant battle great while not looking the part but i did just realize i havent played in a long time and i only have zcrystals thanks for indirectly reminding me to finish up spent my time going through bokoblin clubs and tipping the scales as a tactitian instead of playing
pokemon,not_removed,i got jealous of lillies outfit upgrade so i went and got as close to the exact same outfit so i could upstage her
pokemon,not_removed,its all good raichu wouldnt be able to take a hit even after a full restore especially not from snorlaxs high horsepower and this is coming from a guy who loves alolan raichu
pokemon,not_removed,most of my money went into changeing my hair ive done it like different times
pokemon,not_removed,i absolutely love your art style
pokemon,not_removed,if only male characters had the same level of customization everything in alola is phenomenally worse than kalosclothing wise that is
pokemon,not_removed,i love raichus facial expressions
pokemon,not_removed,i was down to only my alolan raichu in the red from the beginning of the final battle king sparks used nasty plot out sped and one hit every one of those fuckers
pokemon,not_removed,my cousin in a nutshell whenever he comes play together no balls no potions no anything wonder how he could get to the pokémon league 😫
pokemon,not_removed,nice to know im not the only one who spends his elite earnings on those designer accessories
pokemon,not_removed,this is me alright
pokemon,not_removed,me
pokemon,not_removed,you made the brionne comic too didnt you love the art style
pokemon,not_removed,you already know i wasted so much money on strappy sandals and the sun hat
pokemon,not_removed,it is a very real problem but i refuse to use potions in official battles like this one just cause the elite four and kahunas are all dirty cheaters doesnt mean i have to be
pokemon,not_removed,when i was beating the league my pokemons were usually onekoed in last battle who needs potions
pokemon,not_removed,can i get a imgur link
pokemon,not_removed,raises hand guilty
pokemon,not_removed,well excuse me for wanting to look pretty i mean why are these magical animal fights even in my pretty dressup game s
pokemon,not_removed,raichu looks weird
pokemon,not_removed,the best part about playing as a male is that theres less clothing for you to waste money on so you could spend money on whats actually importanf
pokemon,not_removed,this is why you use grass types you can heal without items synthesis is great
pokemon,not_removed,not very funny
pokemon,not_removed,trainer is super cute especially last page first row pretty funny story too
pokemon,not_removed,i did this with that top that was like pokémon be damned i need to look stylish
pokemon,not_removed,perfect detail giving her a luxury ball
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,i wish the player character looked half as good she is super adorbs
pokemon,not_removed,yeah thats where all the money from the ub quest went
pokemon,not_removed,i survive entirely on moomoo milk bought with fashion coins hyper potions arent even worth it since they now only heal more than milk as such all hyper potions ethers ev drinks x whatevers and other such expensive items are sold immediately to buy more shirts or whatever ive bought like two tms total i cant bring myself to buy anything because in the back of my mind im imagining that one skirt i havent bought yet or that ribbon in a color i probably wont wear but want to have just in case i do
pokemon,not_removed,are there actual dresses in sunmoon or did you just take artistic liberties i look for dresses and im always disapointed
pokemon,not_removed,it just adds so much to the individuality aspect people in pokemon appreciate another big step in that direction for me was the ability to change your characters pose and how they throw a pokeball
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,it went by so fast lmao it was funny because i had just run myself dry on funds and thought to myself oh itll be a while before i can afford anything else time to just sit back and enjoy what i hav i get what bye looker gone shopping
pokemon,not_removed,there are two kinds of players in sumo people who got the skull tank as soon as they heard about it and people who dont know you can get a skull tank
pokemon,not_removed,i did that too when i first got it but i quickly realized thats what most people did if it wasnt a skull tank it was a plain black tank
pokemon,not_removed,not even that whats up with this shit where moon got dark clothes and sun got bright ones lol someone mentions you can buy them in the plaza its a random chance of it being the thing you want off the person sometimes its not even available and other times its unreasonably expensive
pokemon,not_removed,snorlax is hard core
pokemon,not_removed,totally thought he was going to be switchin fodder
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,wait what tumblr links work fine for me on mobile what kind of issues are you facing yelling at you to get the app or something i dont face that either but its the only real idea i can think of
pokemon,not_removed,why does buying healing items make you look like a walking pomegranate
pokemon,not_removed,now im glad im not the only one who changed outfits to fit the story i had a different outfit for nearly every zcrystal cutscene
pokemon,not_removed,thanks i made a couple more that were also posted here by other i believe i am flattered people enjoy my shiz
pokemon,not_removed,yeah until now ive switched between male and female avatars each game if next one keeps the outfit changing sure it will now then female all the way from now on that said i spent my money on clearing out each tm store as soon as i could
pokemon,not_removed,its actually based on the place of the final battle with kukui without the domelike glass covering but after that pretty similar
pokemon,not_removed,its a generic ring with a pokeball in the center pokemon go has those extra rings floating around the arena
pokemon,not_removed,raichu would be lucky if it could take out a third of snorlaxs hp with a single attack
pokemon,not_removed,yay
pokemon,not_removed,my guy is so httpiimgurcomalaoulgpng with her shit
pokemon,not_removed,yes that was me thanks so much
pokemon,not_removed,well it is alolan
pokemon,not_removed,boi my lilligant was a beast of quiver dancing planting seeds and healing around lol
pokemon,not_removed,espeons are the best
pokemon,not_removed,the hax bonuses you get from the pokemon loving you is probably the most rewarding system in the game when i first noticed it i felt so proud of my pokemon that shit feels good man
pokemon,not_removed,if i remember correctly right before the pokemon league i wanted to look experienced and mature so i bought all that fancy white clothing including the sun hat and a pair of redtinted glasses from the most expensive store the one at the mall
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt use any items in battle or the exp share at all battle style set too made the game tons harder
pokemon,not_removed,moon is cute though
pokemon,not_removed,i think moon is super adorable haha thanks tho
pokemon,not_removed,edit wrong person
pokemon,not_removed,i dont believe so but httpwwwserebiinetsunmooncustomisationshtml
pokemon,not_removed,artistic liberties
pokemon,not_removed,invoke
pokemon,not_removed,customization makes everything better
pokemon,not_removed,another big step in that direction for me was the ability to change your characters pose and how they throw a pokeball wait what wherehow do i do this
pokemon,not_removed,i actually ran out of the aether foundation final battle to get a headband i couldnt find cause i didnt know olivias shop sold the hair accessories i went back all stylin
pokemon,not_removed,i bought one shirt before the elite four one several title defenses later i redid the hair changed contacts matched shirt and shorts and got a new backpack at the end he looked like my favorite sports star
pokemon,not_removed,its honestly weird i kept running out of money strictly because of the clothes i bought like for every stack of hyper potions i got i could get maybe one or two pieces of clothing i dont remember clothes being this expensive in x and y was it just easier to get money in that game or was it really way more expensive this time around to accessorize
pokemon,not_removed,how do i get one
pokemon,not_removed,man now i want a johtohoenn post game where i can play as guzma with the new roster and i am happy
pokemon,not_removed,sludge tank lyfe
pokemon,not_removed,dyes my friend dyes white colored clothes the dye shops are still exclusive to versions but at least you can choose when to do it once you get them
pokemon,not_removed,you are the greatest this is a hilarious strip and the artist is very talented
pokemon,not_removed,i wasnt able to see the actual comic just the tumblr page with the comic and a preview of it i wasnt able to click on the page either edit i use reddit is fun btw i dont know if that contributed to it
pokemon,not_removed,oh yeah i fully used the character customization here didnt change outfits much in y since there wasnt a ton of outfits i liked so my character stayed relatively the samein moon i went wild xd did one of those clothing changes matchup battles in festival plaza i had changed outfits times
pokemon,not_removed,yeah they are if ya want a good psychic typesp attacker then there ya go
pokemon,not_removed,yep thats where i bought that shirt from it was well worth my life savings
pokemon,not_removed,i saved all my money by running back to the clinic or going until i party wiped since i spent all my money on shit i only lost my pride when i failed myself and my team
pokemon,not_removed,set battle style is the games real hard mode a lot of people overlook it for some reason
pokemon,not_removed,you know the chinalike town go north where the kid and his father the business owner are if i remember correctly to the right of them is the old man who teaches them to you
pokemon,not_removed,everything in alola is more expensive
pokemon,not_removed,the latter is definitely true it was clearly more expensive this time around
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon center in po town
pokemon,not_removed,this guy gets it checked every store after getting my sludge gear never found a good replacement
pokemon,not_removed,and also not entirely you can get othergame dye shops from other people
pokemon,not_removed,you flatter me so much quq
pokemon,not_removed,most likely i use alien blue and sometimes safari i have ios obviously and never had any issues like that thats quite strange
pokemon,not_removed,i use reddit is fun and it worked fine for me
pokemon,not_removed,something something glass cannon
pokemon,not_removed,im grinding for bottle caps everyday in pelago and plaza i probably have enough nuggets to buy everything
pokemon,not_removed,people often complain pokémon is too easy since they learned about evsivs and getting into competitive i personally dont get ittheres enough freedom in the game to stipulate your playthrough to make it harder nuzlockes are some of the most fun ive had with pokémon for example
pokemon,not_removed,i found it its north of malie city near the waste plant
pokemon,not_removed,in my opinion malie city is more japanese since it was founded by johtoans and has a sushi bar the chinese town is the one where olivia lives with the lighthouse and plant salesman
pokemon,not_removed,after you beat the league btw
pokemon,not_removed,some kind redditor linked the comic for me so at least i was able to appreciate it its really funny i can totally see it being an issue due to the website and my paticular app combined im running on a galaxy so reddit is fun is one of the lighter apps my phone can handle without issues
pokemon,not_removed,my device is clearly inferior
pokemon,not_removed,something something best defense
pokemon,not_removed,dont forget the pyukumuku tossing which nets you pokedollars and resets daily
pokemon,not_removed,httpwwwserebiinetsunmoonbattlestyleshtml heres how to unlock them all youre welcome
pokemon,not_removed,immediate results of a google search for sushi in china the original type of sushi was first developed in southeast asia and spread to south china before being introduced to japan sometime around the century
pokemon,not_removed,ah i see its still odd to me but every device is different im glad you got to see it though
pokemon,not_removed,something something all work
pokemon,not_removed,thanks
pokemon,not_removed,well huh til
pokemon,not_removed,me too because its awesome ive experienced weird stuff like this many times and i usually sum it up to a combo is bad apps and my shitty phone but money is a thing i lack so this is what im stuck with
pokemon,not_removed,something something no play
pokemon,not_removed,make homer go something something

pokemon,not_removed,first seen geodude in pearl under the cycling bridge i actually ran out of pokeballs and had to kill it first caught gulpin in sapphire it couldnt have been that long after the geodude either because i remember having been super careful to have as many pokeballs on hand as possible even though it was really early in the game
pokemon,not_removed,espurr i remember i was pretty surprised and desperate to make sure i caught my first encountered shiny ever
pokemon,not_removed,weedle i randomly found it in viridian forest in ss thought something was wrong with my game and i almost released it

pokemon,not_removed,numel
pokemon,not_removed,a probably year old me was playing sapphire and encountered a shiny tentacool i was so scared my game was broken that i immediately turned off my gba lol
pokemon,not_removed,funnily enough a gyarados in diamond though i was using a fishing rod by the waterfall because my friend said thats how you can encounter dragonair and a red gyarados popped up then the next game i got was soul silver and it didnt feel so special anymore

pokemon,not_removed,a shiny nidorina waaaay back in pokemon crystal had no idea why the nidorina was pink but whatever i caught her anyway and yes this was after i encountered the shiny gyarados since i caught her in kanto but clearly i was young and dumb i also caught a shiny paras in pokemon white a shiny machop in platinum and my boyfriend has caughtbred me many shiny pokemon including a competitive furfrou its missing spdef but i dont care hes perfect oh and the shiny charizardrayquazas that were given away a year or so ago as well

pokemon,not_removed,its not possible to get shinies in rby without link trading them from gsr even then they wont be shiny in rby because that isnt coded into the games
pokemon,not_removed,gen didnt have shiny
pokemon,not_removed,i just lost the game cartridge
pokemon,not_removed,hm i pretty clearly remember the route and everything i suppose its possible my memory is off and it was actually silver anyway til
pokemon,not_removed,it was an early gen could you get charmander in gen
pokemon,not_removed,damn i had a shiny ditto from cerulean cave on my leaf green and i lost that damn game too
pokemon,not_removed,no only through the time capsule maybe it was firered and leaf green gen
pokemon,not_removed,lets all just be depressed when we tell stories about how we lost shinies
pokemon,not_removed,maybe that actually seems more likely
pokemon,not_removed,congrats maybe do oricorios if you dont have them next
pokemon,not_removed,collecting those and minior was actually the thing that set me down this path it was a shockingly fun to do
pokemon,not_removed,whats the game
pokemon,not_removed,its a fake pokemon game im making in my off time i have other posts about it and its still early in development but itll have new pokemon and new forms check out this post if youre interested
pokemon,not_removed,as an avid vgc player let me provide some context verlisify has always been a controversial person to discuss due to his videos against smogon and how they are casual and noncompetitive recently verlisify created a video about cheaters titled which he makes some very specific remarks about cheaters and tries to enforce a witchhunt mentality wolfe glick a very prominent and amazing vgc player contacted verlisify and attempted to discuss his views and tried to better understand his perspective this inspired verlisify to release a video titled a video in which verlisify enlists the help of rising taide an ethics phd student analyse wolfe glicks private messages wolfe glick then responds with a video titled httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsajfxriazea in which he states his side of the story he also publishes the private conversation between him and verlisify viewable verlisify then responds with a video called httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqkxkiawcgwa in which he argues the points made by wolfe the verlisify again release a video titled httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmdaqlihzayw in which only one pokemon as actually proven to be hacked wolfe glick responds with his own video titled where he argues the points made by verlisify verlisify then releases a video about id like to say that this drama is bad for the communtiy and if ive made any mistakes feel free to correct me edit it seems that im being downvoted for this this is literally a log of what happened between wolfe glick and verlisify it should contain none of my personal opinions and if it does please tell if you have any questions please ask i dont believe downvotes should be handed down to facts
pokemon,not_removed,im finally glad this problem is starting to be acknowledged furlisify is just a massive drama queen that always thinks hes innocent and that everyone is wrong except for him hell he even outright said to someone to give him a hacked mon to lie to his fans and hes also the main problem of the entire hacking debate no one had a problem with this until him and his brainwashed fans started to go on a witch hunt and say that everyone who hacks should be punishedtheyre not serious are they this freaking pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,listened for minutes and theyre just talking about some douche on youtube what does this have to do with anything can you give a summary of the part you intended us to talk about
pokemon,not_removed,to be honest i dont think think this is helping anybody
pokemon,not_removed,i still dont understand why verlisify even bothers to try to fight a form of cheating when even if he managed to remove would change nothing in the competitive scene because the hacking he hates is just people reducing the time they waste to get perfect pokémon like really would making people not use pokegen to get perfect ivs really make an impact on anything
pokemon,not_removed,what sucks is im a huge fan of verlisify i like his approach to pokemon and looking at the potential in every pokemon i believe smogon sometimes gets a little over the top at times with their bans and in general he creates great content that being said the past few months have been really bad with his drama videos and for awhile i always wondered why he was viewed as this outcast in the poketuber community and now i know making this video probably helped create more drama but i feel this is going to be a one and done and honestly everyone should just ignore him from now on and let him have his drama and if hes the only one talking to himself he looks pathetic
pokemon,not_removed,i dont watch verlisify anymore because of his behavior its pretty crazy and i hope others stop watching his stuff too he doesnt deserve the views or revenue when he treats other pokemon fans the way he does
pokemon,not_removed,posting a video with a title that gives absolutely no information about the subject is not the way to address the problem people are just going to glance over it and move on without watching i mean you dont even give your reddit post a proper title the only reason i know what this is about is because i know of him from vp over on
pokemon,not_removed,i just started pokemon a month ago and its very disheartening to see things like this
pokemon,not_removed,i can understand why verlisifys videos are entertaining honestly with the amount of views he gets for some of his more basic pokemon knowledge videos id say hes done some good for the community but honestly his tirade against hacking and his drama with other competitive battlers is just petty and harmful to the community his elitist attitude is annoying and he gives a voice to those with too much time on their hands and too little reason in their life the bottom line is that pokemon is a game that can be enjoyed by a diverse demographic false equivocation of breeding with real life athletics is not going to make for good arguments there are so many other poketubers worth watching we can do without verlisify
pokemon,not_removed,ive always been against hacking and i know im not the only one the way i see it the game is designed to make breeding balanced you arent supposed to breed an entire team with all perfect ivs rare moves the perfect nature etc its supposed to be a challenge to get there i gets my blood boiling when people get super defensive about and say things like what am i supposed to do waste all that time breeding uh yeah thats kind of the fucking point now admittedly i dont agree with the way breeding works i agree its way too time intensive and is pretty damn frustrating how hard it is to breed the optimal pokemon too much is left up to chance and it really takes the fun out of it that being said the games for now are designed that way if you cheat youre cheating and basically breaking the game to help you win official tournaments thats too unethical for me i know no matter how much i argue cheaters arent going to stop cheating theyve convinced themselves theyre in the right and are justified so ill let them deal with whatever consequences come their way instead i think the ball is in game freaks court they surely know this is a problem and thats its not going to stop so until they actually make raising pokemon a nonchore cheating isnt going away
pokemon,not_removed,the problem isnt that verlisify is wrong about cheating hes actually spot on the problem is hes a huge douche it isnt going to stop though because verlisify has always been about stirring up controversy for clicks the only way to kill him is for people to stop caring also as far as what we should to about the cheating situation i think the answer is that reddit is handling it in the best way possible people who cheat will be able to cheat and people who play fairly can find people to play fairly with until the pokemon company is wiling and able to do something about cheating people will cheat after all its nearly impossible to play in the vgc without cheating
pokemon,not_removed,personally the hacking in pokemon did bug me it was more because i didnt have the tools to hack and was breeding my teams up super slow while others just hacked for it but in the end it literally has no effect on how i enjoy the game i got over it a long time ago went to breedingdittos got myself one of those guys and bred my teams no biggie verlisfy has found a soapbox to stand on and thinks hes important just ignore him and let his clan of pokemon players grumble about it
pokemon,not_removed,while i agree on the drama front i cant say i dont appreciate that at least someone in a relatively popular place isnt acting like smogon is how the game is designed and meant to be played i dabble in it myself sometimes and ive nothing against folks who play it exclusively but some recognition that it isnt the be all end all of the game would be nice that said yeah his attitude has been really foul especially when it comes to event stuff since hes been flat out wrong about some things and still just harasses people about how theyre hacking essentially thats pretty low
pokemon,not_removed,i unsubbed to him after the jethrotex attack i was officially done with him but once in a while ill check by to see what shit hes been doing such as drama and click bait and realize how big of a hypocrite he is he made a video of the top ten alola pokemon when he attacked jethrotex for it i check the comments and i see propped defending him saying he can make it since there is more than pokemon i not only cringed i wanted to roast verlis so badly excuse the caps but his community is fucking brainwashed and dont get me wrong he brainwashed me to he brainwashed me to hate wolfie and to try to defend him but then after constantly looking back on unsubbing from him i finally did and im relieved can his channel just die off already hes the problem that needs to removed i dont understand how he does it but he manipulates people into thinking hes right i dont even get him he thinks everything he does is right sorry for the cursing but i needed to get this out
pokemon,not_removed,hacking has always been a very divisive issue i dont know how you could think it hasnt been debated until now a lot of people dont have an issue with it if youre just messing around in your own game but this ordeal has caused people to realise how widespread it is in actual serious competition nevermind random online battles and trades
pokemon,not_removed,but shouldnt it be held to the same standard other competitive games are when people cheat in a game like counterstrike shit hits the fan people are kicked off teams leagues disban entire teams prize money is called into question etc its a scandal when it happens if pokemon is holding official tournaments where thousands of dollars in prizes are offered i really cant tolerate cheating personally
pokemon,not_removed,its a douche on youtube who bashes people for not playing pokémon the exact way he wants to for some reason hes become very popular which has lead to massive discussions and outrages by people who think they are now entitled to decide how other people should play and to outright namecall belittle and even threaten people who dont do what they say
pokemon,not_removed,sometimes you have to speak up
pokemon,not_removed,you are only looking at the surface he is not really interested in fighting any form of cheating but he is interested in feeding the drama to get more views more money from his videos
pokemon,not_removed,yes it would have an impact as those people cheat to reduce the time it takes to get their pokemon people who play the game legitimately are still working to get those pokemon i hate that while im playing bike simulator for hours to get a new pokemon people are cheating to get pokemon instantly if they find that they need to change something about their pokemon they can do it immediately while i have to start all over its unfair its against the rules and it sucks all the fun out of the game
pokemon,not_removed,i feel sorry for you and verlisifys non drama fans you want to watch his videos about pokemon not drama its sad that hes taken this route even though he had the potential to continuously make content for his fans i personally dont agree with his setsideas but i see no reason for others not to thats my personal opinion for some reason though he doesnt want to listen to his fans and make the content they watch
pokemon,not_removed,verlisify is a person with a lot of views but he is still mostly an outcast among more serious pokemon fans most people just play the game and enjoy it youtube pokemon drama is by and far not a regular occurrence there are a ton of good pokemon youtubers out there if you are interested smogon which verlisify constantly has beef with is a healthy community of competitive battlers their battle simulator pokemon showdown is very well run check it out some times this drama will stay in youtube and the pokemon community will move on like it has
pokemon,not_removed,to be honest i have no problem breeding with a ditto rnged from previous gens it doesnt take that long even before pokebank came out my iv dittos worked fine what i dont like though is the countless hours it takes to capture viable legendaries it is all down to luck and someone could get his legendaries in minutes while it takes me years it is also theoretically possible to never get viable legendaries
pokemon,not_removed,i agree with you cheating is fully wrong and against the rules the way hes going about is completely wrong it seems that if he actually cared about those who cheat hed try to find an alternative instead of complaining and and hunting cheaters tcpi should provide alternatives for me to get a perfect hp ice thundurus with having to wait for rng to favor me i feel that we should inform the uninformed about verlisifys potential intentions
pokemon,not_removed,ignoring him would be fine if he didnt call out every person he suspected of hacking searching wolfe glick shows as a top result wolfe glick uses illegal pokemon while he does use an illegal pokemon theoretically we dont have any basis for claims of it being hacked see ray rizzos aegislash the other claims made by verlisify are more speculation than logical deductions and fact its possible many more poketubers will falsely be called out by him and be subject to defamation
pokemon,not_removed,its true that verlisify covers content that most people want to watch hence the large amount of subscribers the reason all the poketubers play by smogon rules is because they want to play in an environment where the most skilled person wins its kinda sad that one of the only nonsmogon players that gained traction is this guy
pokemon,not_removed,the problem about verlisify and the entire discussion all in itself is that now people have begun to bash you even if youre only messing with your own game and nothing else even if you have never ever touched online competitive in your life
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i havent heard much discussion about this topic at least from the side of the community ive mostly been before i decided to move more around but looking more on it i can see that this was still a discussed topic but never on such a grand scale and yeah despite the fact that im against this entire drama stupidity at least an attention towards the fact that a lot of hacked mons in competitive like vgc tournaments has been made still he has no rights no make people outright start going on huts not just for competitive players but literally everyone that even uses hacking programs and calling out poketubers just to cause such unnecessary drama sm are coming and were here at each others throats and not believe anything is legit anymore causing this unwanted paranoia
pokemon,not_removed,honestly it hasnt the majority of the time it is brought up even in this subreddit has been from idc to as long as it isnt in competition and from the competitive side the community does not really take as much offense to it seeing as it mostly just used to get legal pokemon into the game as well as their not being much sufficient evidence nor reason to make a fuss of it however he does and has tried to witch hunt people in a community that he isnt even apart of nor plays
pokemon,not_removed,the difference is that counterstrike cheating actually gives the person an unfair advantage where as pokemon cheating only gives you something you could have gotten legitimately just in a shorter amount of time between counterstrike and pokemon the impacts of cheating are very different wall hacks and aim bots remove the need for skill map control aiming where as pkhex removes the need for luck all genning does is remove the rng its not like you can gen a sturdy shedinja and take it into vgc it doesnt work like that illegal pokemon combinations get flagged and people have enough knowledge in general to know when something isnt right even without that theres no way to make pkhex give you an unfair advantage given enough time both parties could create the same set
pokemon,not_removed,oh okay so teenageesque drama shit thatll pass within the year if not summer gotcha cant we all just talk about our poplios and whosawhatsits instead of caring about what some guy on the internet says
pokemon,not_removed,yeah but this still ends up like hey this guys acting like a jerk lets talk about why how much of a jerk he is the end it really doesnt help unless they were talking to us telling us to watch out for him or something its still nothing but adding fuel to the drama fire
pokemon,not_removed,his intentions are clear to anyone laying attention his videos are all minutes he picked a fight with the biggest pokemon community in his first big video hes been picking fights with youtubers since then people the knows will indulge him in a conversation verbosity is a youtube troll and hes getting payed for it im a small youtuber for destiny nut getting bigger and i plan on diversifying into pokemon with the release of sun and moon my big plan im going to ignore verlisify ill hopefully be able to collaborate with other competitive youtubers luckily for pokemon youtubers thats just battling and talking about it and when verlisify throws his shit fit we will ignore him that is how to kill verlisify ive seen it happen before in british youtube drama networks oh and for anyone who wants to start youtubing verlisify has created a huge market for people who are pro fair play but hes the only one promoting it if people were fair play and didnt want to watch a douchewaffle you could be the voice of reason other youtubers would line up to talk to you to prove theyre not really cheating and by reassuring them youd invoke verlisifys wrath which is the path to views
pokemon,not_removed,i mean not to offend but if the implication there is that people not playing by smogons tiers arent trying to be competitive or the most skilled person cant win then i think thats part of the issue isnt it for one thing the tiers by far dont take into account that postgen two gf had to take doubles then triples and rotation into account when designing new pokemon it all just revolves around singles which is a huge weakness for the goto source i think i mean my star pokemon last weekend was an ru amidst ubers by their standards if that wasnt what you meant i apologize though hopefully maybe this drama if nothing else will show theres a niche that could be filled i dunno
pokemon,not_removed,this isnt new its been going on for months its just only now that people outside the drama itself has begun talking about it because the problem just doesnt wanna go away though i agree that keeping it outside the subreddit would be a good idea as we havent been infested with it yet and i would very much like to keep it that way so anyone picking popplio this november s
pokemon,not_removed,well they are telling you to watch out for him being a jerk is one thing but the guy steals things and thats a serious issue especially for artists
pokemon,not_removed,i think that idea is remarkably funny im trying to remain unbiased but i love vgc and wolfes one of me idols
pokemon,not_removed,im not saying that not playing by smogons rule system is uncompetitive i play vgc battle spot singles has its own ladder where people compete in a bring use format bringing up bss usage statistics though shows that there is a problem with the amount of same pokemon being used smogon tries to create a more balanced metagame where more pokemon can be used smogons ou format and tiering revolves around singles and thats why they judge pokemon based on their viability in singles i agree though and they have somewhat implemented doubles set on their site in regards to the ru amidst ubers theyre not saying that using the under used pokemon in higher tiers is wrong rather that using over powered pokemon in lower tiers is
pokemon,not_removed,just a quick add to you this has been going on for years with verlisify actually starting with smogon to other poketubers and now the vgc i do agree tho of keeping outside of this particular subreddit tho
pokemon,not_removed,wait what did he steal
pokemon,not_removed,creating a fair play channel dedicated to vgc strats would be a good way to interact with him if you have the time youd need a good mic a way to capture pokemon gameplay a pc or preferably mac with decent editing software and a lot of free time videos a week minimum custom thumbnails and minimal pandering its an easy formula but really hard in practice if you have time willpower and resources youll go far if you only have you might not your videos need to come out often be of high quality and have a high density of content without quality you have a plethora of literally unwatchable videos without quantity you dint have enough videos to justify subscribing without density you have plenty of well produced fluff pieces that arent worth watching its hard work but if you hate the way something is the pokemon youtube community the best response is to change it
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt know for how long this has been going on actually so i played it safe by saying for months i did suspect it having been going on for multiple years though
pokemon,not_removed,watch the video he stole and altered artwork claiming fairuse when it was under a creative commons license requiring artist credit and was not allowed to edit the artwork
pokemon,not_removed,im still a student so i havent got much time perhaps in the future i could then again perhaps verlisify will stop his drama then
pokemon,not_removed,he has been a definite problem for a very long time but only now has he decided to take things further by causing all this conflict amongst us and everyone on the youtube side of the community its been going for to long and all this nonsense has to be stopped also apparently he also looks up keemstar no wonder hes such a douche
pokemon,not_removed,the worst part of all of this is that people are actually listening to him like cattle the discussions ive seen in forums affected by this have sometimes gone completely out of hand especially when verlisify is mentioned
pokemon,not_removed,yep have you seen his twitter he plays so much the victim making call and duncan look like bullies and everyone listens to him worst still he lets no one in the comment section to talk bad about him or his fans or the subject of the video ive only once raised my objection against him and tried to convince some of the confused people in the comments that breeding with hacked dittos is not wrong at all as long as its not vgc but he deleted ever single one of my comments and he still did even now on his recent video where he attack jethro a poketuber liked by many people
pokemon,not_removed,it only goes to show how desperate he is to win the dramawar he himself created no such person should ever be listened to you simply cannot trust them i just do not understand why he still has fans
pokemon,not_removed,exactly and i feel the only reason is just because of his acting and maybe even using the fact that hes a furry to his advantage to look like he is being bullied by everyone
pokemon,not_removed,this sure looks cool by the way seeing the old gen iii designs the oras redesigns of brendan and may really make them look about two or three years younger than they used to
pokemon,not_removed,ah the old brendan why did gf decide to add those wierd shortspants things to some of their characters now ethan new protagonist and brendan have them
pokemon,not_removed,omg i shat brix when i got this and emerald for my bday
pokemon,not_removed,thats actually a really cool shirt
pokemon,not_removed,i remember seeing all things about emerald on serebii when i was playing my first time on sapphire it was hype af i didnt know the site and it was pretty low quality but damn they sure did post a lot things like battle frontier rayquaza and other shit this was definitely my favorite pokemon gen
pokemon,not_removed,rayquaza reminds me of hades from hercules in this omfg
pokemon,not_removed,emerald was my favorite version being able to battle the gym leaders after beating the elite four is something i wish they would do again also the cell phone you had that you could call up trainers or gym leaders to battle them and of course the battle frontier so many features
pokemon,not_removed,i like how they only made the deoxys shirt a youth xl only not all kids back then just stayed on the couch playing pokemon we got some exercise
pokemon,not_removed,we all wore oversized basketball shorts back then thats why
pokemon,not_removed,youth xl is about mens medium i buy childrens shirt for myself all the time maybe they did that so the kid could grow into it later
pokemon,not_removed,well personally i prefer the old ones they just look better and look more comfortable
pokemon,not_removed,i think it wouldve been better to have it randomly decide what pokemon you find of all the nonregular findable pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,or gave you an area to farm several mon kind of like rhe friend safari mixed with swarms from black and white oh rte is gonna have these mon you cant catch anywhere else in game for a day
pokemon,not_removed,but then you find doubles and that is fun for no one when it takes a day to get a new island scan
pokemon,not_removed,they could make sure that you get all of them before you get doubles
pokemon,not_removed,jesus this game
pokemon,not_removed,people are getting real upset about this but guys it was already stuck on paws and that didnt display any more useful information than this if anything i hope that it will be a bit more accurate and load a bit faster it will probably be added again later when the game is more stable
pokemon,not_removed,should be legit now what kind of spooky ghosts were on your cart
pokemon,not_removed,that rayquaza looks sweeet
pokemon,not_removed,these are kinda cool actually i like the articuno and rayquaza
pokemon,not_removed,looks like this one
pokemon,not_removed,thanks
pokemon,not_removed,yes that venomoth was the very first pokemon thing i ever owned i traded a free slushee coupon from for it while at school it started my pokemon craze d
pokemon,not_removed,hell yeah there were a few different sets of these iirc
pokemon,not_removed,oh shit
pokemon,not_removed,i was into pokémon before these came out but i was only six so these lunchable cut outs became the first really solid memory of myself falling in love with pokémon i have never heard anyone mention them until now thanks for the trip down memory lane
pokemon,not_removed,holy crap i used to collect those as well ever since pokemon go came out its been a giant nostalgia fest
pokemon,not_removed,oh my god in the first grade my best friend gave me squirtle and geodude that is how i first even got into pokemon fuck that nostalgia d
pokemon,not_removed,the best part of field trips were lunchables i loved these cutouts
pokemon,not_removed,my very first exposure to pokemon i remember not knowing what the hell they were but feeling compelled to make playdoh sculptures of them all
pokemon,not_removed,mine too they were like gold at my elementary school
pokemon,not_removed,i was about the same age too thy were like gold in elementary i remember being so stoked for the official cards to come out
pokemon,not_removed,right
pokemon,not_removed,yes my whole neighborhood was all about those cards do you have them all or just that one set
pokemon,not_removed,unfortunately i dont know what happened to mine this isnt my picture
pokemon,not_removed,well i couldnt really find solid info on the worth so its probably not much but it would be nice to have them mine are definitely around somewhere but i dont have the full set i must find them now
pokemon,not_removed,let me know if you find them
pokemon,not_removed,just got to my trading card binder i will check through that first and will let you knowpost photos
pokemon,not_removed,mad warrior
pokemon,not_removed,heres a fun fact i picked chikorita for my first because i loved how broken venasaur was in gen i was so upset about the mediocrity of chikorita that i still to this day look down on grass types with a feeling of meh
pokemon,not_removed,notes another busy dayquick drawing my main goal was to be clean and direct in comparison to my other drawings the linework is actually more confident and clear because of that i didnt focus as much on proportions so the legs go up too high the back leg looks more life a flipperfin and the tail didnt notch in correctly the leaf is pretty solid there is some nice life in the eyes but the proportions of the face are catty wompus right eye too high mouth too long good thing is that i accurately turned the face with the head it feels like its wrapping around the cylindrical head despite the flaws accomplishments clear and concise simple not overwrought much less bs and beating around the bush values are pushed more and shading is softer because of the blending i did normally ill use hard edged shadows which im trying to get more control over and vary it up
pokemon,not_removed,thats a good mr stake
pokemon,not_removed,oh boy i cant wait for the rest of the starters these drawings are looking absolutely amazing keep them coming mate
pokemon,not_removed,i always picked chikorita becuase i loved how under appreciated it was and how hard the first three badges were gonna be really felt like the beginnings of an underdog tale
pokemon,not_removed,i feel the same i always start out thinking thinking this is gonna be the game when i take a meganium through the whole game with me and i always dump it after it evolves and is still really useless
pokemon,not_removed,this brought a big old smile to my face thank you
pokemon,not_removed,i always find it weird that mega gyarados isnt waterdragon despite gyarados itself is based on chinese dragons
pokemon,not_removed,please dont be afraid to criticize
pokemon,not_removed,and then gyarados used waterfall on charizard for letting him down
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know what charizard is upset about his y mega is way more useful then his x
pokemon,not_removed,but why didnt it work
pokemon,not_removed,mega gyarados being a waterdragon wouldve made no difference in destroying lysandre with a single fairy type ie xerneas
pokemon,not_removed,id like to see an alternative ending with charizard x where hes happy but gyarados is really sad
pokemon,not_removed,but charizard x is dragon gyarados changes form more furr but its official mega has none of it and charizard doesnt change at all i dont get it
pokemon,not_removed,charizardite y
pokemon,not_removed,but mega charizard x is dragon people please the meme is dead this joke has ben done to death even when it dosent make sense anymore
pokemon,not_removed,thats because mega gyarados emphasizes its destructive tendencies and in game balance terms is more tenable
pokemon,not_removed,people keep saying its because gyarados would have had no weakness in generation making it overpowered in combination with its high attack but they could have just added another dragontype attack and anyways wasnt the whole point of gyarados to get a powerful pokemon by training the pokemon everyone thought was weak
pokemon,not_removed,or even dragonflying or fuck go all out and make it dragondark
pokemon,not_removed,its perfect the quality only enhances the comedy
pokemon,not_removed,only thing that detracts from the punchline is that they dont seem changed at all specially charizard p make chars wings bigger and change gyarados colors to the mega ones and itll be perfect
pokemon,not_removed,stone edge just to be cruel
pokemon,not_removed,given youre running a special attack charizard
pokemon,not_removed,mega charizard y is fireflying while mega gyarados is waterdark dont ask me why
pokemon,not_removed,mega charizard y is fireflying and mega gyarados is waterdark
pokemon,not_removed,its mega charizard y check the third horn
pokemon,not_removed,not sure if i understand correctly but there are pokemon like sceptile who got dragon typing despite being not related to dragons in anyway nor emphasizing on any dragon characteristics
pokemon,not_removed,also because it has like what three dragon moves the dragon type on mega gyarados wouldve been wasted stab crunch is juuuust riiight
pokemon,not_removed,also will be overpoweredunderpowered we need to balance it out is not a thing i can ever believe the developers said during the development of gen if they had they would have said having so many poison types will make psychic types overpowered we should make sure bug and ghost types can actually counter them i could go on but half of the examples are psychic types are too strong ghost and bug types are too weak why the hell is everything halfpoison and the point is really supposed to be that theres no way they made gyarados waterflying because of balance that word didnt exist in their vocabulary thats probably literally true they didnt concern themselves with the concept
pokemon,not_removed,that point is bs gyrados dont have a dragon type attack that relies on attack hack he can barely use his attack stat on dragon or not gyrados was a bad pokemon in the whole point char and gyrados are not dragons is thus they are easily obtainable imo i think they want to go with the idea that dragons were something of myths in and typing stuck to those were not has shit ton of mistakes that carried over imo they are just going with the that was a feature not a bug motto i guess why they are not fixing obvious things is beyond me but it is too late for it now anyway still mad about onion fairy did not lose its phsyc to a fairy type btw
pokemon,not_removed,rock smash because fuck it
pokemon,not_removed,oh ok but also they still look the same no mega evolution happened never mind i get the joke
pokemon,not_removed,now i feel so blind x okay not everyone is good at find the differences
pokemon,not_removed,cough ampharos cough
pokemon,not_removed,they dont look closely p gyarados has a new manething and charizard has grown a third horn and some other little details theyre supposed to be mega charizard y and mega gyarados
pokemon,not_removed,yeah that one too i dont know if gamefreak see dragons the same way we see them
pokemon,not_removed,or altaria why is a cloudbird also a dragon
pokemon,not_removed,oh wow how did i not notice that
pokemon,not_removed,well amphaross japanese name is denryu which translates to electric dragon
pokemon,not_removed,but its definitely a sheep giraffe thing i see no dragon there and unless getting flowing locks of hair makes you a dragon i dont know how the mega does anything to fix that so it just feels like the japanese name is broken
pokemon,not_removed,oh makes sense then til
pokemon,not_removed,its wordplay just like how draco meteor is classified as a dragon type move because it is called ryuseigun in japanese which contains the word dragon
pokemon,not_removed,doesnt draco mean something to do with dragons anyway
pokemon,not_removed,super nerd koushiros atlurheracross used megahorn buster
pokemon,not_removed,in pokémon x and y super size pumpkaboos have a chance of holding a miracle seed while all other pumpkaboos only have a chance so if the pumpkaboo is not holding a miracle seed it is definitely not super sized actually only the super sized pumpkaboo will hold a miracle seed in x and y it will have a chance while every other size has a chance this makes it even easier everyone else though will probably say super as its high hp stat is higher then smalls high speed despite smalls low hp stat being higher then supers low speed because if something is already low why does it matter if it has a couple extra i dont really understand what youre trying to say this is exactly why people recommend the super sized one it isnt outspeeding anything important with the extra speed from being smaller but it might be able to take an extra hit
pokemon,not_removed,the only really good size is super small may look appealing because of its decent speed but small gourgiests base speed is just under the mark of pokémon that a lot of people use charizard talonflame crobat and greninja are all faster than gourgeist and can all easily dispatch it base attack also doesnt go very far especially for a pokémon without attack boosting moves super size it slow but attack is very usable and base hp is way way better than hp it can take hits and dish them out much better than any of its other sizes plus with shadow sneak who needs speed anyway this is a nice guide i knew about super size flying higher but i didnt realize that they were closer to the ground at smaller sizes
pokemon,not_removed,go with super size because gourgeist is a good support pokémon it has access to moves like pain split destiny bond will o wisp leech seed foul play skill swap and many more the added bulk from the super size will make it survive even super effective hits use it carefully because this thing can be tricky to deal with
pokemon,not_removed,i solved this problem of collecting one of each haha
pokemon,not_removed,i checked on serebii and it said all pumpkaboos have a chance of holding a miracle seed in x and y im not much a competitive battler so the whole stat thing im very ignorant to
pokemon,not_removed,serebii is wrong then bulbapedia is the one i go to for stuff like this and it says only the super sized one does also all other guides i have seen say this and finally i remember from when i was looking for a super sized one that i used a frisk pokemon and never once saw a non super sized one with a chance of finding a super sized one i should have found at least one other pumpkaboo with a miracle seed also you didnt include the most important thing that makes it super easy to tell super sized apart from the rest they have a different cry which is noticeably deeper all the others share a cry
pokemon,not_removed,ill fix that miracle seed thing real quick then and also the deep cry things is second to last on the list so its already there
pokemon,not_removed,whoops must have completely skipped over the cry part im used to it being at the top since its honestly the easiest way to tell outside of having a pokemon with frisk as your lead
pokemon,not_removed,i think you mean fiancé
pokemon,not_removed,i always upvote these my gfbf did this for me posts when theyre good but at the same time it makes the void in my soul even bigger
pokemon,not_removed,marry her
pokemon,not_removed,shes a keeper
pokemon,not_removed,that is beautiful what materials did she use i would kill for something like that
pokemon,not_removed,thats so freaking good its unbelievable
pokemon,not_removed,how large is that
pokemon,not_removed,holy crap thats awesome
pokemon,not_removed,swag
pokemon,not_removed,that is cool af
pokemon,not_removed,shes a keeper
pokemon,not_removed,hey dont be down i was once in that side you will find someone who will make this kind of things for you
pokemon,not_removed,yes she is
pokemon,not_removed,its paper thank you i really love it
pokemon,not_removed,its like cm or inches
pokemon,not_removed,thank you
pokemon,not_removed,ive been really antisocial for all my life and dont have any people skills the only reason i can do it online is because i have a defense against shaming myself maybe ill get out of it but you should definitely be thankful for the people in your life hard to see what you got most of the time
pokemon,not_removed,i dont really have people skills neither but i think you will meet a person that will be special for you youre right we should be thankful for the people that care for us dont give up
pokemon,not_removed,i think online dating services would fair well for you worst case you lose a few bucks best case you meet someone special
pokemon,not_removed,after the one attempt i had never again
pokemon,not_removed,change it up talk to someone for a few months before you meet also dont use something like tinder
pokemon,not_removed,i never even met the last person after that many months i found out i was being cheated on yes i get that its not a representation of everyone but its just some reason thats kept me from trying again also i cant really try online sites as a high schooler
pokemon,not_removed,ohhhh youre a high schooler okay well i assure you it will get better then take this advice as it will both better your future in relationships and success go to university make sure you put yourself out there and you will meet hundreds of people i still thing school is the best thing for introverts
pokemon,not_removed,thank you its about time someone here recognizes my baby
pokemon,not_removed,not really in all honesty the whole luck factor can be frustrating but if you really are struggling best thing you can do is to grind for levels or try to turn the rng more in your favor by using moves like thunder wave its what i use and other moves like that really helps prevent pokemon rnging you to death with moves like fury attack early on
pokemon,not_removed,depends on which ones youre playing tbh i dont remember about super since i havent played it as much but in explorers there are pure seeds which warp you to the stairs and certain pokemon can learn the iq skill stair seeker which points you in the direction of the stairs making it much easier to find
pokemon,not_removed,xray specs were always incredible for this by equipping them you ensure that you arent blind sided from an enemy so you can avoid them or prepare for them better as far as stair location just kind if common sense your way through it if you have the option between filling an area in that is larger versus one that is smaller go with the larger area regardless of its four way direction as the stairs are more likely to be there this was a key concept that helped me get completely through one of the zero isles but i dont recall which one
pokemon,not_removed,im trying to figure out for super it doesnt help when it gets pretty hard but i guess i need to grind more
pokemon,not_removed,rmysterydungeon in general though super mystery dungeon is only hard if you dont make use of everything available to you items especially if you play it smart the game is actually much easier no grinding necessary until postgame and even then its really optional
pokemon,not_removed,yeah super is hard grinding will help though as will actually making teams suited for the dungeon youre going toi know i dont love not using my original team for everything but it does make some missions so much easier you can also use your gold bars for vitamins which is a really good boost or be like me and use them to by scores of reviver seeds for each dungeon also if you can find the ally reviver emera then youre basically golden just send your teammates away from you so you can all go stair hunting and when one finds it switch them to the leader until youve gone to the next floor
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon raw and durex
pokemon,not_removed,i laughed xd
pokemon,not_removed,id preorder
pokemon,not_removed,jesus even google couldnt save the pokémon go launch
pokemon,not_removed,what country dont forget which country
pokemon,not_removed,do you still have any
pokemon,not_removed,source check out more of my pokévillagers
pokemon,not_removed,these are just fantastic and traditional makes it even better the mudkip bulbasaur and totodile are my favorites amazing work
pokemon,not_removed,yesyes i wish this was a real thing
pokemon,not_removed,kk cruisin on up these are just as adorable as the game itself i love em thanks for this
pokemon,not_removed,this is too cute i really love how adorable and friendly looking he is i will say that its a tiny pet peeve that hes wearing pants since animal crossing villagers dont wear pants but your style is really fantastic and he looks great
pokemon,not_removed,thanks a million kind redditor please look forward to more in the future
pokemon,not_removed,there will be more on the way please look forward to more
pokemon,not_removed,no problem more to come soon
pokemon,not_removed,i know they dont wear pants but the thought of them being half naked is a bit jarring to me haha even if its true to the game however i think it adds to the aesthetic a bit more the mayor cant be the only one wearing pants haha
pokemon,not_removed,nebby i swear to fing god get in the bag
pokemon,not_removed,nebby always win
pokemon,not_removed,how about nebby vs a bag of holding
pokemon,not_removed,rnebbyinthebag
pokemon,not_removed,nebby definitely nebby
pokemon,not_removed,nebby since there cant be bags if each one costs
pokemon,not_removed,cosmog can learn teleport p
pokemon,not_removed,i mean ten thousand bags are a lot of bags
pokemon,not_removed,would you rather fight nebby sized bags or bag sized nebby
pokemon,not_removed,put space broccoli baby in bag put bag in bag repeat profit
pokemon,not_removed,bag sized nebby she wouldnt be able to fit checkmate bagists
pokemon,not_removed,nebby but only if it attacks at night oh wait
pokemon,not_removed,doesnt nebby know teleport
pokemon,not_removed,the bags would win if they attack at night
pokemon,not_removed,nebby would fear the hated of ten thousand bags
pokemon,not_removed,ok where exactly did this get started
pokemon,not_removed,nebby win every time
pokemon,not_removed,this kills the nebby
pokemon,not_removed,this requires way too much dexterity roll a dexterity check dc
pokemon,not_removed,throw a portable hole in there to for good measure if teleported to another plane via being inside a bag inside a bag will you ever truly be out of the bag again
pokemon,not_removed,oh hey look its my monthly sub i didnt know i needed
pokemon,not_removed,that was my guess about minutes into the game really
pokemon,not_removed,nebby only learns splashcosmoem learns teleport
pokemon,not_removed,have you played sumo
pokemon,not_removed,first i saw was a post on the fp here telling nebby to get in the bag
pokemon,not_removed,does nebby need air tho he is a space broccoli
pokemon,not_removed,nebby is a cosmic fartball held together by magic i think it has infinite dexterity rolls nat
pokemon,not_removed,perhaps ultra space and the astral plane are one and the same frantically writes necrozma in as my next bbeg
pokemon,not_removed,wouldnt that open a hole to the astral plane and if ultra space and astral plane are the same thing
pokemon,not_removed,that happens to me daily
pokemon,not_removed,cosmog also learns teleport at level
pokemon,not_removed,yes i know what its originally referencing im just not sure how it became a meme here
pokemon,not_removed,space broccoli 😂 im dead
pokemon,not_removed,you and nebby start a comical chain of you pushing him into one bag just to see him pop out of one of the other bags
pokemon,not_removed,really well guess its not totally useless then
pokemon,not_removed,its something minor and amusing perfect material for a meme
pokemon,not_removed,i misread your flair for meme researcher v
pokemon,not_removed,brb renaming my second cosmog to space brocco xd
pokemon,not_removed,im absolutely stealing that for my flair
pokemon,not_removed,so you did
pokemon,not_removed,im a man of my word
pokemon,not_removed,first
pokemon,not_removed,congrats catch a shiny zubat
pokemon,not_removed,awesome at least u got a sweet crobat
pokemon,not_removed,noice
pokemon,not_removed,i think i will never find a shiny
pokemon,not_removed,gogurt the crobat
pokemon,not_removed,aw yeah i was never a big fan of zubat till i caught my boy vlad here hes even got pretty good ivs but that doesnt really matter to me much
pokemon,not_removed,hey pal chin up i didnt actively find this shiny the shiny found me and someday itll find you too
pokemon,not_removed,that wouldve been a better name
pokemon,not_removed,why vlad russian patriotism s
pokemon,not_removed,maybe vlad dracul the real name of dracula
pokemon,not_removed,in soviet russia
pokemon,not_removed,exactamundo my friend
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon cannot relearn moves from previous evolutions it has to be in their move pool to learn it this includes moves that they are technically unable to learn if in their move pool the are set to learn at a level before they can evolve i tried to have my event snorlax relearn recycle but couldnt because that move is only in munchlaxs move pool not snorlaxs serebiis pokedex pages specifically have a section for moves that can only be learned by preevolutions of a pokémon i believe
pokemon,not_removed,what does zsplash do
pokemon,not_removed,raises attack by
pokemon,not_removed,att
pokemon,not_removed,i like to think that nurse joy is just super awkward like shed go out to eat and when thecwaiter says enjoy your meal shed blurt out you too
pokemon,not_removed,aw the little stall abomination is so cute when its asleep and not toxiccursemoonlight stalling me into an infuriated grave kidding i love umbreon its so cute
pokemon,not_removed,my all time favorite pokémon 🖤
pokemon,not_removed,jolteon jolteon great job by the way
pokemon,not_removed,glad you like it
pokemon,not_removed,thank you
pokemon,not_removed,id be a pokemon ranger but less like their represented in the series and more as a real life national park ranger my vehicle and best friend would be a scolipede or a zookeeper
pokemon,not_removed,i imagine id help work on the pc storage system
pokemon,not_removed,probably the same thing im looking at in real life being a professor
pokemon,not_removed,id still be a theatrical technician i love my job and pokemon would make it so much better
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon archaeologist the real kind studying human interaction with pokemon in ancient history not the archaeologists in the game who study pokemon and are more like paleontologists
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon photographer thatd be fun
pokemon,not_removed,not sure maybe a groomer of some sort
pokemon,not_removed,daycare man
pokemon,not_removed,id be a professor
pokemon,not_removed,id be a doctor like a higher quality pokémon centre id have blissey for healing reasons and a poochyena umbreon and growlithe for the younger patients to play with maybe a scyther to help with surgery
pokemon,not_removed,id probably be a professors assistant as cool as a professor would be ingame professors pretty much cover one aspect of pokemon whereas my topic of interest covers multiple areas of research shown so far specifically id intern with sycamore out of all the things to research the study of mega evolution would captivate me the most specifically how mega evolution arose from the codependence between people and pokemon and how it relates to other codependent phenomena such as friendship evolution and evolving eevee into sylveon
pokemon,not_removed,probably a chef having a fire type for cooking and a grass type for good herbs and spices would be great
pokemon,not_removed,id probably be a bike shop owner i love working with bicycles id probably host bike races in whatever town im in too
pokemon,not_removed,in weeks i begin firefighter training so in the pokemon world i would still want to do that except i would have a wartortle
pokemon,not_removed,pokémon paleontologist i find it hard to believe there can be only a handful of prehistoric monsters i wont rest until poképark is open ive always had a major attachment to the fossil pokémon and id likely be obsessed with finding more either that or a pokémon geologist discovering and identifying any differences between rockground types of different regions and climates figure out where crystal onix come about the special features of chargestone cave and its effects etc or perhaps even an archaeologist uncover the mysteries of how ancient societies created pokémon like baltoy and golurk why sigilyphs continue to patrol territories and what their former purpose was or even look into ancient techniqueslegends concerning any original cohabitation of humans and pokémon with particular interest to the lost giant pokémon that showed up sporadically in the series
pokemon,not_removed,i would be a pokémon coordinator because contests are manly fun
pokemon,not_removed,im a virologist so id be interested in studying pokerus and any other diseases of pokemon and humans im trying to think what pokemon could be useful in a lab as assistants maybe psychic types to telekinetically get me things having a pokemon bunsen burner would be useful too
pokemon,not_removed,my vehicle and best friend would be a scolipede or a zookeeper your vehicle and best friend would be a zookeeper
pokemon,not_removed,yes tech theatre thanks for all you do for us actors
pokemon,not_removed,humanpokémon interaction would be more along the lines of anthropology wouldnt it
pokemon,not_removed,now just make a small incisioh dear arceus no
pokemon,not_removed,im still in high school probably going to study english
pokemon,not_removed,you are very welcome
pokemon,not_removed,well archaeology is a subset of both history and anthropology basically it depends on whether you are studying a culture or an event or piece of history which determines what your studies fall under usually its a bit of both
pokemon,not_removed,berries werent an addition for the story mode of the game they were very obviously made with competition in mind weaker berries like the oran berry is just to ease you into how they work
pokemon,not_removed,berry trees in gen dont die off theyll wither after a month but you can restart them in x and y just going to the farm once or twice a day should be plenty edit i forgot to add according to bulbapedia all berry growth times in xy are multiples of hours and the soil always dries out in exactly hours
pokemon,not_removed,wanted to ask have you played oras i have felt the exact same way as you for years but in oras ive noticed a huge convenience added to berries such as the plant may die not as often as before it will replant itself and regrow ive only ever seen a regrowing plant once and that was a surf only berry tree i couldnt get to for awhile secondly the berry masters house has a huge berry planting area which makes farming so extremely convenient everything is in a giant circle so crops are simply to reap and sow just throwing out my two cents because at least in most the current game they have improved it
pokemon,not_removed,leppa berries are the best
pokemon,not_removed,i think hgss handled this issue very well with the berry pots they essentially made berry patches portable allowing you to check and water berries just by getting the berry pots out of your bag however you were limited to planting only berries at a time i honestly dont know why they removed that feature it was really convenient because checking on berries scattered all over the region was kind of a pain
pokemon,not_removed,youre not alone ive always thought this also before you gain fly going back to harvest old berries you planted didnt seem worth it especially because you didnt gain more then back if planting a seed got you berries then maybe itd be worth it
pokemon,not_removed,as other people have said growing berries is a lot easier in gen i managed to get of all the most useful ones with minimal effort just plant them in the berry masters garden and check them once a day
pokemon,not_removed,hey stop using logic with our complaints making us look dumb and stuff
pokemon,not_removed,thats something i never actually knew i feel like theres a lot in the game that they never even bother to explain and just expect you to discover on your own
pokemon,not_removed,i have played oras but ive never had the berries continuosly replant themselves
pokemon,not_removed,i like that it makes for good exploration but i think for something like this where were used to one thing last gen but theyve updated it this gen they should make note of it somewhere
pokemon,not_removed,yeah ive never had an issue with berries not being ready to be picked in oras in fact ive become somewhat of a berry farmer indeed ive been eager after planting and gone back too early sure but ultimately the berries are much for efficient than past gens ill agree it could definitely still use work though
pokemon,not_removed,blasto burn
pokemon,not_removed,this is actually quality enough for any other day nice job
pokemon,not_removed,waddup
pokemon,not_removed,im watching pokemon xyz with my kids the other day my wife comes in and watches for a minute and goes this is a kids show why does greninja have a dick

pokemon,not_removed,alolan greninja be rolling down the street alolan greninja be rolling to the beat o shit waddup
pokemon,not_removed,doragon craw
pokemon,not_removed,s a t o s h i k u n
pokemon,not_removed,well its a repost
pokemon,not_removed,were cool guys looking for people to carry on our legacy nothing sexual
pokemon,not_removed,is she talking about that blue triangle or the tongue scarf
pokemon,not_removed,for harambe
pokemon,not_removed,one word kalos league
pokemon,not_removed,come back tomorrow
pokemon,not_removed,o
pokemon,not_removed,so many have yet to see it until now m o r o n
pokemon,not_removed,the battlefield just got weird
pokemon,not_removed,the triangle
pokemon,not_removed,this must be his way of making it up to ash
pokemon,not_removed,hado puranto
pokemon,not_removed,shit
pokemon,not_removed,too bad he cant ride it indoors
pokemon,not_removed,its that repost
pokemon,not_removed,waddup
pokemon,not_removed,you forgot the waddup part
pokemon,not_removed,what the crap cynthia
pokemon,not_removed,alternative when you max out its happiness it takes off the disguise and turns out to be a cute little scared blob
pokemon,not_removed,what is this kingdom hearts
pokemon,not_removed,i actually hope that if mimikyu gets an evo that the cloak will become a raichu
pokemon,not_removed,if it does have an evolution it would be stupid for it not to have it friendship based
pokemon,not_removed,that is terrifying and adorable adorafying terridorable
pokemon,not_removed,if you cant love yourself how the hell are you going to love somebody else
pokemon,not_removed,kinda has a feel to it
pokemon,not_removed,it looks like goomy with armsi like it
pokemon,not_removed,where my people at where my people at where my people at where my people at
pokemon,not_removed,can you imagine how disguise would work on this i get the funny mental image of pokemon attacking the fake head because they legitimately believe its the real head
pokemon,not_removed,what a vaguely cait sith looking pokémon
pokemon,not_removed,thats just goomy under a a black cloth
pokemon,not_removed,what if it evolved into a pikachu but kept its typing and couldnt evolve into a raichu
pokemon,not_removed,id think it be cool that if it evolved with happiness we would see its true form sort of like a you loved me for me type deal
pokemon,not_removed,very good im really hopping for a evo but i dont think hell get one
pokemon,not_removed,it becomes obese
pokemon,not_removed,brilliant
pokemon,not_removed,if it did id want it to just be the form without the disguise
pokemon,not_removed,mimikyu looks like its about to say woooobbafet any time now
pokemon,not_removed,what is mimikyu had an evolution via sadness
pokemon,not_removed,well if its happiness was high id think mimikyu would be comfortable with who it is as it has a friend and go back to its original form not needing to rely on pikachu
pokemon,not_removed,is that a dark type goomy who grew ears
pokemon,not_removed,i love this well done
pokemon,not_removed,mimmikyu becomes mimmikoomy love it
pokemon,not_removed,it looks like something tim burton would make
pokemon,not_removed,love it ❤️
pokemon,not_removed,looks like the heartless from the underworld in kingdom hearts
pokemon,not_removed,if only game freak was that creative
pokemon,not_removed,it should evolve into something that looks like an alolan raichu after seeing its popularity rise
pokemon,not_removed,id want it to evolve from pokemon amii that feels like it creates more of a bond then just walking around
pokemon,not_removed,its a big fluffy goomy
pokemon,not_removed,i thought doppelgengar would be a good idea for an evo this is alright too though
pokemon,not_removed,considering mimikyu is my favourite from the new gen reveals this made my day nay my month
pokemon,not_removed,that is so cute
pokemon,not_removed,i love the message here it implies mimikyu hides under a disguise because it is scared of what people think of the real mimikyu but through love from its trainer it learns to love itself and be proud of showing off who it really is
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think it would look anything like that
pokemon,not_removed,remove that pika head and its great
pokemon,not_removed,happiness increases via having a pikachu in the party
pokemon,not_removed,idk why but it looks so troll
pokemon,not_removed,i have no idea what im looking at but i love it anyways
pokemon,not_removed,muh heart
pokemon,not_removed,i feel like if it evolved though happiness itd lose its disguise as it wouldnt need it to feel loved anymore
pokemon,not_removed,wierd design but i think it would evolve via love
pokemon,not_removed,if it evolved into that then i would no longer want it on my team not saying your art is bad its great i would just prefer something that isnt just a bigger version for the evolution
pokemon,not_removed,i really hope it evolves through happiness it will make me love the thing even more
pokemon,not_removed,it should have evolutions of happiness and or frustration
pokemon,not_removed,oohhthere buddy you totally look like a raichu even the pokedex got it wrong
pokemon,not_removed,yeah thats pretty cool
pokemon,not_removed,but why did it keep the lil pikachu head
pokemon,not_removed,i hoping for an evolution similar to this my idea exactly was the monster underneath getting bigger and scary while the costume sits on its head
pokemon,not_removed,kinda looks like pangoro haha has the same colour scheme
pokemon,not_removed,wouldnt it be another pokemon its trying to mimic
pokemon,not_removed,it looks kinda like pokii
pokemon,not_removed,i cant tell if the black parts near the cloth are just covered up by the cloth or if theyre actual teeth it really looks like big teeth
pokemon,not_removed,he should have a happiness and sadness evolution
pokemon,not_removed,mimikrai
pokemon,not_removed,nope im sure it would be the same pokemon with a raichu disguise
pokemon,not_removed,mimiqt
pokemon,not_removed,i really want that to be true mimiku feels love comes out of the blanket
pokemon,not_removed,cait sith
pokemon,not_removed,no thank you
pokemon,not_removed,its goomy
pokemon,not_removed,it should have a happiness evolution and a rejection evolution both exactly the same stats and abilities but the happiness one evolves when at max happiness and holding a soothe bell return automatically maxed rejection form is a trade evolution and frustration is always maxed
pokemon,not_removed,i think if mimikyu does have an evolution it would evolve into a mewtwo doll and would be called mewtoo
pokemon,not_removed,so im not getting back into pokemon i quit in the gen and never looked back but mimikyu is the first one ive seen in years that ive fallen in love with its just so fucking sad i love it
pokemon,not_removed,😍😍😍
pokemon,not_removed,what if when its happiness is maxed out and its holding a light ball and you use a thunderstone it evolves into a real pikachu and its so proud of itself and so happy
pokemon,not_removed,hey that actually makes sense unless we could actually see whats under its cloak
pokemon,not_removed,the thing about unhappiness is its pretty stupid you know what lowers happiness special medicine and fainting in battle you know what increases happiness walking i think that an unhappiness evolution wouldnt work but maybe just have it evolve into something different when its happiness isnt maxed out
pokemon,not_removed,if its evolved through friendship wouldnt it just do a bad cosplay of its owner have the self confidence to do a better pikachu cosplay
pokemon,not_removed,i really like this evolution design
pokemon,not_removed,king mimikyu
pokemon,not_removed,id like to think that the lore behind this evolution is that although mimikyu grew it still hangs on to the old costume because it still loves it
pokemon,not_removed,love it
pokemon,not_removed,this would be an awesome boss in kingdom hearts
pokemon,not_removed,youd think think he would no longer be imitating some pokemon after he was loved
pokemon,not_removed,that kinda looks like a kingdom hearts monster
pokemon,not_removed,remember that sunlight hurts it so cant remove the blanket but can do something else with it
pokemon,not_removed,or maybe just change forms based off his happiness
pokemon,not_removed,that would be dumb
pokemon,not_removed,i mean why he should still disguise if it was just because he was shylonely but still wanted a friend by tricking one to have him
pokemon,not_removed,another alternative when you negative its happiness it increases its disguise and becomes terrifying edit i do understand how happiness works in pkmn it was just joke
pokemon,not_removed,yup heartless was my first thought as well
pokemon,not_removed,still dont understand the story
pokemon,not_removed,the dooris open
pokemon,not_removed,mimikryu
pokemon,not_removed,not if hes still trying to get people to love him poor raichu
pokemon,not_removed,replaichu
pokemon,not_removed,could be from pokemonamie like sylveon
pokemon,not_removed,prayer circle for friendship based cute evolution
pokemon,not_removed,this is what i was aiming for actually think about it if it evolved via happiness then it can trust its trainer and wouldnt need the coat as much anymore revealing more of a scary body which is what i think mimikyu wants to avoid in the first place to be accepted the thing is i also made it look cute on its on way so it had the irony that it didnt need the coat in the first place to be accepted
pokemon,not_removed,terridorable that sounds like a potential name for a new pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,adorabloodthirsty
pokemon,not_removed,rawwtf
pokemon,not_removed,how is this terrifying
pokemon,not_removed,can i get an amen
pokemon,not_removed,where my people at where my people at
pokemon,not_removed,happiness is a warm gun
pokemon,not_removed,um loving someone else is completely separate from loving yourself
pokemon,not_removed,i thought the same thing
pokemon,not_removed,does nintendo is chucklefish
pokemon,not_removed,and isnt going to attract the slime fetishists
pokemon,not_removed,i love that as i scroll this thread ive found not one but two rpdr references im too curious now to see if thisll continue
pokemon,not_removed,what part of this reminded you of roxxxy andrews
pokemon,not_removed,and then gets a mega
pokemon,not_removed,thats the idea of this post
pokemon,not_removed,im the contary i love mimikyus design and have a soft spot for singlestage pokemon if he does get an evo tho i hope it looks badass
pokemon,not_removed,full of happiness
pokemon,not_removed,it would take a dark path from its loneliness and depression and turn into a monster
pokemon,not_removed,copikyut
pokemon,not_removed,i think the pika head could be simplified to a sort of worn down version of its old disguise maybe just the head shape with some scribbles in the center it doesnt make much sense for it to maintain its costume once its comfy enough to grow out of it
pokemon,not_removed,no if it feels love from someone it can finally love itself so instead of mimicking you mimikyuu it would mimic itself mimikmii
pokemon,not_removed,but why i love ghost types
pokemon,not_removed,is a pokémon desperate for love mimics popular pokemon gets a trainer evolves through affectionfriendliness would be dumb
pokemon,not_removed,because seeing its true form causes humsns to become deathly ill
pokemon,not_removed,the cloth also protects his ghost body from bright lights
pokemon,not_removed,do you even know how happiness works in pkmn
pokemon,not_removed,when you decrease its happiness to max unhappiness it evolves into a shadow pokemon that can only live within shadows like a person has a shadow on a sunny day so it lives there which that makes it so effectively accurate that its accuracy cant be drained and the close proximity to any opponents would allow it to get some pretty decent hits but due to it effectively being just a shadow it has a pretty horrible moveset
pokemon,not_removed,when does the nobody pokemon come out
pokemon,not_removed,looks more like a dream eaterspirit
pokemon,not_removed,got you covered spoilers obviously
pokemon,not_removed,the story is easy to understand its just a fcking stupid story
pokemon,not_removed,duplaichu
pokemon,not_removed,excellent word play for mimicry which hisherits mo
pokemon,not_removed,i think it might be better if it loses the pikachu disguise its not actually a part of its body after all i think if the logic is that it evolves through the happiness of being accepted and trusting its trainer then it seems kind of weird that that would stick maybe he could get another evolution in which he doesnt find that happiness and acceptance and doubles down on its costume inadvertently turning itself into something really terrifying
pokemon,not_removed,i would develop a pathological need to adopt and evolve all of them
pokemon,not_removed,that is too adorable ill be mad if it doesnt happen let us love mimikyu
pokemon,not_removed,i have been found out retreat
pokemon,not_removed,can i get a gay men
pokemon,not_removed,amen holla holla
pokemon,not_removed,ill take a threemen holla
pokemon,not_removed,chaos is a ladder
pokemon,not_removed,its a rupauls drag race quote henny
pokemon,not_removed,the rumor come out does nintendo is chucklefish
pokemon,not_removed,huh til
pokemon,not_removed,what is rpdr
pokemon,not_removed,the same parts the same parts the same parts
pokemon,not_removed,its boxxxy mandrews
pokemon,not_removed,which could be what op drew
pokemon,not_removed,i was more thinking of like not even having the pikachu stuff anymore type deal so it doesnt have to hide sorry i should have been more clear
pokemon,not_removed,full of httpiimgurcomzfftuxopng
pokemon,not_removed,but when i tell my doctor this she just laughs
pokemon,not_removed,maybe if it had gotten skinnier
pokemon,not_removed,it reminds me of the angler fish in the spongebob movie
pokemon,not_removed,im saying the design is dumb
pokemon,not_removed,what if its like ponytas fire and its controlable mimikyu can cause illness if frightened like a skunk can spray if you and your mimikyu are as close as peanut butter and jelly maybe it wont happen
pokemon,not_removed,as long as its just a rumor im certainly down to try it
pokemon,not_removed,from bulbapedia it doesnt seem to do so did i miss something
pokemon,not_removed,actually taking the thing off without its consent will give you pokecancer
pokemon,not_removed,new scale unhappiness thats right folks weve brought the throw rock at pokemon back and you can use it on your team
pokemon,not_removed,that was the joke you cant negative happiness do you think i didnt know that
pokemon,not_removed,ability shadow all attacks involving whatever its name would be cannot miss and have an additional power if your attacking nevermiss power but if the opponents pokemon is attacking they benefit too
pokemon,not_removed,considering there is a heartless pokemon here there has to be a nobody pokemon out there somewhere
pokemon,not_removed,right after kingdom hearts
pokemon,not_removed,what do you think shedninja is
pokemon,not_removed,sooner than you think
pokemon,not_removed,it looks like a mimikyugoomy hybrid
pokemon,not_removed,well now im going to play all of kingdom hearts again
pokemon,not_removed,raiclone
pokemon,not_removed,duplakaichu
pokemon,not_removed,if it loses the costume then it was going to be barely recognizable so i decided that it would keep it but not make it its main body
pokemon,not_removed,itd be interesting if i recall i dont think there is a pokemon which evolves from hating its trainer its a decent concept for a handful of pokemon ghosttype eevee but i doubt nintendo would want to encourage players to deliberately abuse their pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,ooh wow good idea mind if i take a stab at that
pokemon,not_removed,same gets a random one on wondertrade you poor thing i will love you forever join my army heres a bunch of soothe bells and let me fix you a smoothie dear child
pokemon,not_removed,hey
pokemon,not_removed,ah gotcha never got into that show
pokemon,not_removed,im curious if he means he learned of slime fetishists or that goomy was famous there but at the same time id rather not know
pokemon,not_removed,it rupauls drag race its a reality competition show for drag queens and also one of the best shows on the telly
pokemon,not_removed,op said that she included the costume so people would still recognise it
pokemon,not_removed,all you feed me is poffins i need nourishment tauros meat or something
pokemon,not_removed,its not though its awesome
pokemon,not_removed,speak for yourself
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,that is why our character has no soul
pokemon,not_removed,httpwwwpokemonsunmooncomencapokemonmimikyu hmm my bad i thought it said that with more certainty
pokemon,not_removed,no i dont want to keep track of more numbers in pokemon megashold itemsivsevstypingstabpoweraccuracynaturez attackabilities edit i forgot about priority moves
pokemon,not_removed,theres an influx of new players thanks to pkmn go so its difficult to guess
pokemon,not_removed,chandelure is pretty heartless too
pokemon,not_removed,only if the body has a strong will
pokemon,not_removed,so never
pokemon,not_removed,snover as well
pokemon,not_removed,everyone is the old bald dude one way or another or everyone is sora one way or another
pokemon,not_removed,raitwo
pokemon,not_removed,kinda reminds of trubish having its bag rip open when it evolves leaving all of that
pokemon,not_removed,also if it loses the costume this kills the trainer
pokemon,not_removed,i think you nailed the concept perfectly the disguise is a fundamental part of what mimikyu is but as its shown kindness by a trainer it stops feeling the need to genuinely try to hide itself behind the disguise anymore eventually it evolves or perhaps simply changes its form its a ghost it can proportion itself how it wants into one which deemphasizes the part of its body pretending to be something else in favor of the part that actually is mimikyu
pokemon,not_removed,have it dragging the costume behind it with one hand or make it just a hat
pokemon,not_removed,in that case and thats my personal taste it might be better to keep the costume features on the big yellow part instead of just having the head of the costume stick out on the top it looks kind of off to me again though personal taste i think maybe keep the blushing cheeks and smile and the color palette on the ears dont think the eyes would fit anymore itd be kind of like literally outgrowing the costume but some parts sticking on
pokemon,not_removed,there is a move like that tho
pokemon,not_removed,you could feed it herbs
pokemon,not_removed,do as you like i dont mind
pokemon,not_removed,oh and by the way do you like cinnamon or butterscotch better just curious
pokemon,not_removed,very yes
pokemon,not_removed,😏
pokemon,not_removed,thats reasonable
pokemon,not_removed,both
pokemon,not_removed,is it only an english show
pokemon,not_removed,gotcha yeah i think op stated that after i posted my comment my bad thanks for the heads up bud
pokemon,not_removed,fuck i mean venusaur
pokemon,not_removed,your right a big blob with a little pikachu head super awesome
pokemon,not_removed,i am all stare directly at shedinjas back on this blessed day
pokemon,not_removed,chara confirmed
pokemon,not_removed,bro i almost nearly jizz myself for the intricate bits of pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,ah i see ive been playing since platinum so i guess in terms the history of pokemon im still new wait why am i typing all this
pokemon,not_removed,how dare you
pokemon,not_removed,raitwo mimikyu
pokemon,not_removed,symmetrichu
pokemon,not_removed,maybe if its happy it loses that negative effect
pokemon,not_removed,good point
pokemon,not_removed,tt bbutterscotch please
pokemon,not_removed,no its american but you can find it on netflix in most places if youre interested in watching id recommend starting with season
pokemon,not_removed,just because its simple doesnt make it dumb
pokemon,not_removed,rkenm the only light left in this world
pokemon,not_removed,dolt
pokemon,not_removed,wut
pokemon,not_removed,badtimesahead
pokemon,not_removed,well i remember that when i was in elementary school my older brother defeated the elite four and the champion in pkmn emerald idk maybe you are pseudo chatting
pokemon,not_removed,congrats reddit you did it notentirelysurewhatyoudidthoughokilljustleave
pokemon,not_removed,mm yes like how dr irabu from kuuchuu buranko goes between like a giant bear and a kid dragging along a teddy bear that actually sounds very likely
pokemon,not_removed,thanks
pokemon,not_removed,i honestly have no idea
pokemon,not_removed,i believe it is also on amazon prime video if thats your gig some of the early seasons are hard to find season is probably the best place to start
pokemon,not_removed,kthanks
pokemon,not_removed,ummmwhat
pokemon,not_removed,or it can be just like every other final mythical and not have anything to do with the next gen deoxys didnt neither did arceus or genesect volcanion might have a very minor feature but it wont be prominent
pokemon,not_removed,might end up being something like heatran can find it in a separate area post game and catch it or just an event pokémon
pokemon,not_removed,you are right
pokemon,not_removed,at most it would be either an event that unlocks a mega or a new form like hoopa
pokemon,not_removed,yup absolutely
pokemon,not_removed,opened a few packs from pre that i was going to give to my nephew i dont know anything about these cards seeing if there is any value in any of these these are diamond and star and foiled cards from the packs
pokemon,not_removed,rpokemontcg
pokemon,not_removed,if youre gonna open old packs i think you should have done some research on the values first
pokemon,not_removed,technically speaking pure water is not a conductor of electricity but the ions and impurities in water do
pokemon,not_removed,i think the reasoning as to why steel type pokémon arent weak to electric type moves is because their bodies function as a faraday cage or whatever some of them have on the inside it works especially for grounded steel types for whom the electricity would just pass over their metal skin and into the ground of course i see that this reasoning can be flawed however it is the best explanation i can give on the subject
pokemon,not_removed,but steel only has of the conductivity of copper the exact amount depends on the composition of the alloy so its actually quite a bad conductor for a metal source i have a doctorate in materials engineering and know how to use google
pokemon,not_removed,tbh i feel like many steel types like magnemite or metagross should be strengthened by electricity its more or less implied that their biology is nothing more than electromagnetic currents
pokemon,not_removed,then steel should regain their resistance to dark
pokemon,not_removed,metal on its own is not so much of a conductive material matter of fact it can even act as an insulator for certain electrical charges its all largely due to the impurities in the substance itself same with water the salt and minerals in it are what make it conductive pure doesnt conduct electricity in any way that said i feel steel should be actually immune to electric and weak to poison which is a fancy name to define virtually all matter of toxins and corrosive substances not just biological venom
pokemon,not_removed,this right here no electric fields inside a metal object
pokemon,not_removed,til what a faraday cage is thanks why dont they teach that stuff in school
pokemon,not_removed,that may be so but not all steel types are made of steel specifically its more of an overall metal type with a fancy name
pokemon,not_removed,holy cow you know how to use google
pokemon,not_removed,we were actually taught about this at my school on a field trip to a technology history museum when we had about the subject
pokemon,not_removed,they do at least in a physical science course
pokemon,not_removed,id say its likely because its not pertinent unless you plot on pursuing a career in physics interesting information is interesting but it isnt the major point of education
pokemon,not_removed,he has a doctorate
pokemon,not_removed,well im still in high school so its probably just too early but i feel like i should have learnt this last year the education in my country is kind of messy anyway
pokemon,not_removed,well im still in high school so its probably just too early but i feel like i should have learnt this last year the education in my country is kind of messy anyway
pokemon,not_removed,i literally just graduated from high school last week so i am not that far ahead of you in the educational system p depending on what country you live in that is i live in denmark and i think our high school is different from the american one
pokemon,not_removed,shrugs
pokemon,not_removed,i live in greece
pokemon,not_removed,its european so at least i suppose the educational system is closer to what we have in denmark here we graduate when were around years old
pokemon,not_removed,here we graduate when were but ill be due to being born in december
pokemon,not_removed,ah then its mostly the same then save for a small years difference p
pokemon,not_removed,well not quite we kind of have a teacher shortage so schools accept worsethanaverage teachers seriously i could teach better than a certain one of my teachers also some of the greek in out books is just not understandable in a desperate attempt for them to sound classy and elite also every book tends to have a couple of chapters which are useless and thus skipped its not like we dont properly educate ourselves but we do it in a bad way and we dont learn a few stuff others do ps sorry for taking so long to reply and bothering you with something you probably dont give a fk about
pokemon,not_removed,that sucks dude i could say the same about a certain teacher i had last year at my school its no wonder he got fired when his teaching method was literally just holding a lecture and then leaving the class for the rest of the day not to mention the three entire courses that were completely irrelevant to my field of study i mean what the heck can someone who studies media and communication use metal crafting cooking reports and medicine for i swear every single educational system in the world is just skewed in one way or another i hope whatever youre gonna do after high school provides better teaching than what you have now ps dont worry about it its nice to have a normal conversation on this sub for once that doesnt happen too often
pokemon,not_removed,wow metal crafting cooking reports and medicine xd anyway i hope the same thing too i still dont know exactly what im gonna study though something related to either science or programming probably damn i just had the weird realisation that i often talk to people who are significantly older than me here i wonder what my mental age is
pokemon,not_removed,i know right they hide that stuff from you under the course names technology innovation and technicals stuff that sounds completely relevant to the field of study but they arent they really arent that sounds really interesting im going to study programming as well together with graphical design and media im aiming to become a game developer you see not sure what field im gonna specify in though ive heard the programmers have a significantly harder time than the writers and designers maybe thats because the general age here is around the early the likelyhood of you striking up a conversation with someone at the age of or is much higher than someone whos for example though im sure you can just google a mental age test and youd get a thousand results xd
pokemon,not_removed,being a game dev sounds like a lot of fun gaming is my passion but i dont really know the work conditions under which a developer does his job i hope you can achieve what you strive for though here in greece we choose a general career path instead of a specific field of study there are two paths the theoretical one which includes ancient greek history social studies etc and the scientific one which includes physics math chemistry biology etc however some subjects which dont belong in a certain path are there anyway for example you still study ancient greek even in the scientific path fk that also my real age is somewhere between and cant give you an exact number
pokemon,not_removed,thanks a lot the working conditions for a game developer can vary greatly it all depends on how you want to work you can be an indie developer and work on your own or you can assemble a team of your own or you can join a game development company different companies also have different working conditions and furthermore your working conditions also depends on what youre working with programming story writing designing music and so on that sounds interesting but what if you want to be something that doesnt fit into those two boxes i cant imagine a carpenter would need neither history nor physics and biology for example eh alright i guess i mean theres no need for that anyway xd but i might as well tell you mine ive already done that multiple times on the sub today im p
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know what id do if i cant find anything suitable for me that has to do with either science or programming i told you what my age roughly is to give you an idea of the difference in years between me and the average pokeredittor anyway this was a pleasant conversation but i have to go to bed since its am over here and i dont intend to sleep at am yet again bye
pokemon,not_removed,then i hope you do find something that suits you theres gotta be a wide variety of options to choose from once you graduate high school right and your age isnt really that much off from the average rpokemon user the average is around but theres still plenty of users but yeah its been nice to chat with a fellow pokéfan i should props also go to bed its am here and i havent exactly gotten enough sleep these past months in the runningup to my exams theres no need to make it even worse than it already is xd though ill probably be here tomorrow too as i have absolutely nothing to do these days now that summer vacation has begun
pokemon,not_removed,know what zekrom youre a kewl guy or woman genderequality ps zekrom rocks
pokemon,not_removed,guy would be correct and i can only say the same about you ps lucario rocks
pokemon,not_removed,thats not how bulbasaurs bulb works
pokemon,not_removed,i see no zygarde
pokemon,not_removed,gotta catch them all
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,it could also be that in a fight the person with the high groundaerial view has the advantage
pokemon,not_removed,but that doesnt really make much sense because the term fight or flight doesnt necessarily suggest that one is better than the other it just references how certain organisms respond to danger by either standing and fighting or running away im pretty sure flying has an advantage over fighting simply because you cannot punch a bird
pokemon,not_removed,ever try to punch a bird
pokemon,not_removed,that makes less sense than trying to punch a bird
pokemon,not_removed,interesting connection never thought about that but it doesnt really make sense while yes the words can be paired together it isnt really implied that one is better than the other not before after or over but or as i see it flying beats fighting due to height advantage i promise you attacking against gravity upwards generates less power than attacking with gravity downward as well flying types are typically quite agile which makes it harder to hit so it goes both ways
pokemon,not_removed,wingull is fairly light and low kick is a weight based move its pokémon not rocket science
pokemon,not_removed,i just mostly thought its because its hard to punch flying things
pokemon,not_removed,you know seeing that comic again makes me think of why fighting does halfdamage to bugtypes have you ever tried to punch a fly
pokemon,not_removed,theres no rocket science to this fighting is grounded while flying isnt a flying foe can always get the advantage especially against a grounded enemy most fighting moves are physical so you tell me how trying to punch an aerial bird is gonna work
pokemon,not_removed,but in what way does fight or flight imply which would have the advantage its an interesting way to remember that they have damage interactions but personally punch a bird has always been what worked for me remembering the differences in weakness and strengths between rock and ground is the worst though
pokemon,not_removed,fight or flight explains literally nothing how does that place flying over fighting in any way why is fairy weak to steel fairy steel fairy is pink pretty in pink pink rhymes with clink what goes clink tom hanks da vinci code anaconda malt liquor
pokemon,not_removed,awkward zombie comics always manage to be funny and succinct
pokemon,not_removed,well low kick damage is based on weight and wingull weighs nothing a different attack may have gave you the ohko i understand thats not the point but this post wouldnt have existed if you used another move
pokemon,not_removed,why is ice not resistant to water it really needs more resistances
pokemon,not_removed,i just thought it was cuz its super hard to punch a bird
pokemon,not_removed,probably also because low kick does damage based on weight and a wingull probably weighs like pound combine that with a resist and yea u arent gonna be doing much
pokemon,not_removed,have you ever tried to punch a bird
pokemon,not_removed,except the flight in fight or flight doesnt mean literally fly away into the sky using your wings it just means flee safely i bet the only reason the term is fight or flight instead of fight or flee or something is because flight and fight rhyme also as other people have pointed out even if we do pretend its about actual flight theres no indication that one is superior to the other also this expression probably doesnt exist in other languages using the same word flight
pokemon,not_removed,why is dark se against ghost
pokemon,not_removed,the weirdest type for me is bug flying is se because birds eat critters and similarly bugs eat plantation so they beat grass but why are they strong against dark and physic types do magicians hate insects
pokemon,not_removed,love you awkward zombie hope youre not too butthurt over tpp
pokemon,not_removed,for those who would like the comic on the creators website
pokemon,not_removed,have you seen the rocky movies how long did it took rocky to catch that chicken
pokemon,not_removed,this reminded me of obiwan in episode three lava fight
pokemon,not_removed,this what i attributed it to too it has a huge advantage in movement over a landlocked mon
pokemon,not_removed,i dunno you could probobly punch a penguin ostritch or emu if you got close enough
pokemon,not_removed,i googled this cause i was sure someone would have tried and recorded their effort and it turns out if you bait the bird with food they seem quite easy to punch
pokemon,not_removed,every day
pokemon,not_removed,i knew this would be the first comment
pokemon,not_removed,i punched an owl in the face once
pokemon,not_removed,well i cant punch a bird but that bird shouldnt be sending me to the hospital either
pokemon,not_removed,love the flair
pokemon,not_removed,thats because fighting type is basically the good type in japan not literally and bugs are often on the side of good in japanese folklore thats why they mutually resist each other
pokemon,not_removed,youd need chopsticks for that one
pokemon,not_removed,i used to assume fighting was super effective against bug types because they could just squish the bug
pokemon,not_removed,isnt also a reference to the martial artist trying to catch a fly in chopsticks thing
pokemon,not_removed,this would lean more towards flying being supereffective against ground not fighting
pokemon,not_removed,by that logic flying types should be immune to all physical moves not named stone edge
pokemon,not_removed,iron is used in folklore to repel fairies
pokemon,not_removed,i find they do some of the best pokemon comics
pokemon,not_removed,because dark is a malevolent force and ghosts are spirits the darkness corrupts them
pokemon,not_removed,its widely assumed that psychic types which represent the mind are weak to types that represent common phobias bug dark and ghost
pokemon,not_removed,i always figured that for psychic it was something like insects have such an alien mind that they cant get a read on bugs or something
pokemon,not_removed,psychic mind so imagine common fears for humans evil or afraid of the dark dark arachnophobia fear of insects bug ghosts afterlife ghost
pokemon,not_removed,being bugged out is a feeling short of fear you cant quite place how you feel but you know its not right and it effects how you think closest i can get for psychic p and bugs hide in the darkness they were born in it blah blah
pokemon,not_removed,its over anakin i have the high ground
pokemon,not_removed,you were my brother anakin i loved you you were the chosen one
pokemon,not_removed,whats great is that in the official video game when you play as anakin we get to see what he was planning he jumps over obiwan turns midair and knocks obiwan into the lava as he lands
pokemon,not_removed,if you punch an ostrich get ready to have your world wrecked
pokemon,not_removed,thats why piplup is not flying
pokemon,not_removed,interesting how fighting type moves are super effective on doduo an dodrio huh
pokemon,not_removed,perfect thank you
pokemon,not_removed,sitting on the toilet and everyone else in the bathroom is now wondering why the fuck im laughing so hard
pokemon,not_removed,right when they go on the ground like using roost and lose their flying type they become much easier to punch
pokemon,not_removed,its its the first reference op made in the post though
pokemon,not_removed,i bet the owl just laughed it off and called you a hoot then flew away to crap on your car
pokemon,not_removed,youve never fought a cassowary i see
pokemon,not_removed,that must be so awkward for scrafty
pokemon,not_removed,where do people keep getting this fighting goodhero in japan theres literally no basis for this
pokemon,not_removed,wouldnt that mean fighting should be super effective against bug
pokemon,not_removed,yes but when speaking of ground it means literal earth a flying creature diving into hard dirt is gonna hurt it not a grounded enemy youre fighting
pokemon,not_removed,yes and its super hard to punch a bird to death my point was that theres a much clearer reason than whatever op tried to explain
pokemon,not_removed,lol what is a ghost if not a spirit corrupted by darkness
pokemon,not_removed,actually dark is akin to dirty fight cheap shots i think its more because you cant really trick bugs
pokemon,not_removed,you underestimate my power
pokemon,not_removed,well now you have the lava ground
pokemon,not_removed,you were supposed to bring balance to the force not destroy it
pokemon,not_removed,he actually just stabs him and kicks his lifeless body down the slope kenobi never goes in the lava wow i never realized just how cringeworthy those cutscenes were
pokemon,not_removed,at least he didnt suggest cassowary lol
pokemon,not_removed,thats why fighting is strong against fighting
pokemon,not_removed,flying is normal damage against them the only things super effective on doduo and dodrio are ice electric and ground
pokemon,not_removed,but they arent
pokemon,not_removed,a large eagle or hawk would be a better flying example cassowaries are basically armless velcioraptors
pokemon,not_removed,antihero antivillain
pokemon,not_removed,a big part of japanese historyfolklore has the heroes resemble beetles or are turned into bugs by evil spirits also theres kamen riders which is a pretty big thing for superheroes in japan
pokemon,not_removed,did ya google it
pokemon,not_removed,the idea is that its really hard to catch the fly but the fly also cant harm you
pokemon,not_removed,well casper would like to have a word with you
pokemon,not_removed,a spirit to be honored which is why noble fightingtypes cant hurt them this is a japanese game
pokemon,not_removed,i dont know thiazzy i dont know
pokemon,not_removed,i trick bugs all the time ever see them attack man made street lights boom scienced
pokemon,not_removed,dont try it
pokemon,not_removed,he didnt suggest it because nobody would be that stupid
pokemon,not_removed,bit its not
pokemon,not_removed,oh shit sorry im an idiot i thought they were normal type for some reason
pokemon,not_removed,thats not what he asked good explanation though
pokemon,not_removed,are you telling me hitmonchan is a bug or machop makuhita 俺は日本に住み、日本語のポケモンをやってるんだ。「格闘」とはそういう正義の意味じゃない。 edit for clarity not meaning to offend you or argue about it or anything but i just honestly do not believe the fighting hero stuff doesnt make any sense from a japanese perspective
pokemon,not_removed,is that really the rationale i just assumed it was because punching a ghost would be futile
pokemon,not_removed,high jump kick misses
pokemon,not_removed,wait what i could have sworn that it was
pokemon,not_removed,ha not a problem at all
pokemon,not_removed,theyre normalflying so the fighting against normal and the fighting against flying cancel out for normal damage
pokemon,not_removed,they are but the flying type neutralises the fighting weakness
pokemon,not_removed,fighting is neutral against itself
pokemon,not_removed,i hit focus blast i still lost the battle but that tyranitar will never give me that smug look again
pokemon,not_removed,a couple weeks ago i was trying to breed for a competitive bisharp first i needed an adamant pawniard so i started breeding to get that first eventually a shiny pawniard came out of an egg but this was before i had an adamant pawniard to pass down the nature so i was hype followed by slight sadness that i probably wont be able to use it the way i want by some miracle however it was adamant
pokemon,not_removed,months after sumo came out i went over to my neighbours to have a game night i decided to take my with me and play or i had been shiny hunting registeel since had come out and collectively had srs between them and or a little bit of intoxication had happened and i had to get to ancient tomb saved got ready to sr again encountered the board game got busy at this time and when i look back at my i had to have at least people tell me that registeel wasnt silver i literally had encountered what ive spent years looking for on the very first encounter after months of leaving it alone tldr i found a shiny registeel on the first sr after months of playing sun and moon while drunk
pokemon,not_removed,i triggered a missingno trainer battle in pokemon blue that apparently no one else online has similarly experienced and the whole event was lowkey the set up to an awful creepypasta changing music and all
pokemon,not_removed,i think mine would be finding a shiny mudbray in moon then about minutes later finding another shiny mudbray also happening on the games release day
pokemon,not_removed,caught what i thought was a legendary pokemon in volcanrona with one ultra ball had never heard of the pokemon before but it was displayed like a legendary pokemon in its own dungeon and everything got it to red threw an ultra ball caught sun moth
pokemon,not_removed,i managed to make it to pike queen lucy in the battle frontier once once
pokemon,not_removed,i wonder if someone back in the gold and silver days ever got a shiny starter and didnt know what it was all about
pokemon,not_removed,when i first seen one of those portals in omega ruby i was curious so i thought id save and check it out i wasnt prepared to catch a legendary at all so i figured id just reset move on and eventually come back but i went up to it pressed a and then a shiny hooh appeared i used my master ball btw
pokemon,not_removed,well if were talking luck in the real world i lost my xl in the middle of an rv show rip everything in my bank and or and i guess everything that was downloaded for some reason when i go to the area w the staff i see my xl in the back on a desk i wish i knew who turned it in if were talking luck ingame on my first ever pkmn game black i found a pokerus timburr just outside pinwheel forest wo even realizing what that meant i dont think ive ever found one since i also found a shiny rowlet in eggs after giving the masuda method a few month break due to no shinies from probably near snivies and charmanders
pokemon,not_removed,over many years ive randomly had my pokémon infected with pokérus emerald omega ruby moon and definitely more i also got two shinies in a single playthrough of black day apart and a shiny minior in eggs nothing too special compared to some others but still not too shabby edit another one yesterday my ys save was corrupted for seemingly no reason while not lucky in and of itself i found out when i tried to load up bank to put my living dex in for the charm if that had happened only minutes later i couldve potentially lost an entire living dex complete with all pregen vii pokémon except normal golbat and normal trevenant
pokemon,not_removed,first wild pokemon i encountered in platinum was a shiny starly
pokemon,not_removed,years ago i found a shiny gloom in the wild in as and since gloom has two evolutions i managed to get that beautiful purple and pink shiny belossom instead of that orange and pukegreen shiny vileplume and then a few months later i managed to masuda method hatch an adamant shiny marvelscale dratini its ivs arent that good but i managed to hatch it surprisingly quickly and yes i know that shiny dragonite looks kind of ugly but i actually like how it looks somewhat like an invertedcolor barney with wings
pokemon,not_removed,two master balls in the lotoid in pokémon omega ruby backtoback
pokemon,not_removed,does the tcg count i bought two japanese boosters one was breakthrough x and one was breakthrough y japanese packs have the series split in two the first packx i pulled a zoruark break and the second y contained a mega mewtwo y full art it was first edition too which was nice as for the games havent had much luck there no shinies yetim bound to find one soon and the status moves all seem to hate me
pokemon,not_removed,in my first playthrough of sapphire i caught a shiny swablu i then caught another one when i was playing alpha sapphire i was pretty excited about it

pokemon,not_removed,most of mine are about shinies apparently i hatched a shiny rhyhorn two shiny miltank in the same batch of eggs and recently while trying to breed some apricorn ball snivy for wondertrade i ended up hatching a shiny contrary one after a few eggs
pokemon,not_removed,i think the reason your cartridge suddenly recovered is because when something goes through the washing machine water is about the only thing accumulated although the temporary presence of water is electrically inconvenient in the moment the main longterm danger is if the water leaves behind certain minerals thats why trying to dry things too quickly is a common mistake that ruins circuits your giving up saved the day
pokemon,not_removed,three shiny pokemon in a row that seems to have consumed most of my shiny luck unfortunately
pokemon,not_removed,tried to do the missingno glitch to duplicate some rare candies somehow got a charmeleon

pokemon,not_removed,after a very long while of playing the original pokemon gold in my childhood a few times over on a gameboy pocket family having troubles with money no rubysapphire for me growing up a bit learning to save up any bit of money id ever get finally getting a ds in and pokemon diamond shortly after starting the game ive longed for on one of the first routes i encountered a shiny shinx it was the best my first real shiny pokemon of course not counting the red gyaradostm from gold i was so excited and happy ive since transferred it over to my copy of y to pet it some i havent trained it it feels too pure
pokemon,not_removed,a friend of mine bred a whole team of shinies in one day without using the swap method
pokemon,not_removed,my first shiny was a shiny rattata in soul silver my first reaction was why is this ratatta gold i knocked it out without realizing tt but seriously wtf would i have done with a shiny raticate anyways then in alpha sapphire before i got into shiny hunting i encountered not one not two but three shinies in the span of a week first i believe was gloom now a shiny vileplume then pelipper then drumroll please shiny slowpoke encountered randomly in a mirage cave so yeah now i have a purple mega slowbro and technically i have a shiny shellder too but idk if that counts p and remember that this was all in the span of a week and given that i didnt play pokemon that much back then and this was the first time i had played in a month i still cant believe my luck
pokemon,not_removed,i was shiny hunting for a shiny voltorb in oras in new mauville on what was around the horde encounter a shiny magnimite appeared this was my first shiny later i was hunting for a shiny machop the first few encounters gave me a shiny machop i caught it and kept going for whatever reason the next horde encounter was another shiny machop with an adamant nature and guts
pokemon,not_removed,not really pokemon related but i got my wet after some kid on my bus got my bag wet i know i know it was pretty smart to bring it to school in the first place so it stopped working a few months later i went back to it just for old times sake and it actually stayed on felt so happy because i had fea dlc on there other lucky story was breeding for rowlet with egg moves to wonder trade and matsuda method for shiny and it finally happened right after i went to train pikipek to learn brave bird for skarmory eggs and a shiny yungoos appeared granted i didnt want it but ill take any shiny i can get

pokemon,not_removed,after receiving four out of five trophies for the battle maison in pokemon x i was dedicated to earn my final one multi battles ill spare the intricate details but it is a strange mode anyways i had failed many times doing this swapping trainers as prtners to find the right person i had found someone with a terrifyingly powerful yet fragile infernape and i owe my victory to this trainer i had even lost to the battle chantelaine straight wins so i gave it my all and continued trying and finally won by the most stressful fucking moment in my life i literally dropped to my knees with hands shaking like some sort of weeb check the replay here
pokemon,not_removed,the first ditto i encountered was a shiny managed to catch necrozma in a beast ball
pokemon,not_removed,if that ever happens to any game again try the rice trick it works for phones so i wouldnt be surprised if it works for cartridges good to hear it recovered the next day though
pokemon,not_removed,i got two shiny rowlett in a row while shiny hunting i was also using iv parents so they came out with iv i then went on to hatch a shiny female salandit on my first try only took me eggs i feel like its justice though in the last few months of gen i tried hatching a shiny charmander i was using masuda method and shiny charm hatched over eggs and didnt get it i thought my game was broken or something i might eventually try for a shiny charmander this gen again when i get around to it
pokemon,not_removed,i was looking for a modest synchronize ralts spent like an hour dexnav chaining in alpha sapphire first modest synchro i got was shiny like minutes later i get a second shiny ralts that kind of thing never happens to me

pokemon,not_removed,i somehow got pokerus i dont know when i dont know how but my emolga just suddenly got it when i played white
pokemon,not_removed,looks like im not alone i too have been guilty of leaving my pokemon games in the washer and dryer theyve to my surprise still had he entire save still intact unrelated but ive also have had a pair of ear buds i left the washer and dryer twice and theyve lasted for maybe months up until present day where theyre on the verge of dying in game my best stroke of luck was finding both a shiny gastly and a shiny slowpoke while in melemele island
pokemon,not_removed,well i was fishing for a feebas encountered a magikarp then encountered a goldeen i also have gotten a shiny rockruff in encounters
pokemon,not_removed,was breeding some dusk and friend ball mimikyus together first egg was shiny even more insane i think it was the very first egg i ever hatched in the game excluding the eevee gift egg back in alphasapphire first playthrough got to champion steven he killed my entire team and i was down to my azzumarril suzy holymoley she was a tank but even she was about to go down so i kept myself in this eternal loop of reviving someone fainting suzyswitching into the revived guy then heal suzy to full health revive the other guy lathe rinse repeat until suzy managed to finally kill his freaking metagross or whatever it was he had i still to this day have no idea how i pulled that one off and no i never went back for a rematch christmas season and there was a competition on a forum where doing various things ingame and documenting it would give you points one of the things was encountering a wild shiny during the event im skyping with a friend and i go yeah right liek thats going to happen and a day or two later as im in front of the daycare in kalos trying to find smeargles i guess to sketch moves or something wild shiny spritzee anf of course i caught the sucker and got loads of points and then dropped the whole thing as i got too busy irl it seems to be a running gag that through no softresetting i always end up with the appropriate gender for my starter on my first playthrough female on chikorita fennekin and popplio and male on the others except for exeggcutor and currently mimikyu everything i tried to catch in beast balls dragons and version exclusives would get in the ball with little trouble didnt run out and i only had like of them
pokemon,not_removed,caught regirock in sapphire with a pokeball at full health on the first turn
pokemon,not_removed,if i were a pokemon my ability would be super luck i got my first shiny pokemon about days into x my first game i was intent on catching them all and people wanted meowths i got one on the gts and bred it so id have something desirable to trade things were going well when all of a sudden i notice a newlyhatched meowth had pink paws eventually i evolved her into a persian another stroke of shiny luck i wanted a shiny eevee and mm breeding wasnt working so i took up dexnav chaining i searched on and off for weeks that way but no dice one night i thought ill just chain like before i fall asleep the very first one was shiny i kinda freaked out and im pretty sure that my marowak lita took kos in a row but stuck it out because she didnt want to disappoint her trainer for pokemon cards it was my first pack of the sunmoon expansion i went to gamestop and said theyre released today do you have them they said no but i didnt back down i stood around until the guy went in the back and carried out the big stand of cards i snatched up a pack and paid for them then opened it in my car and what was in there a one of the prettiest cards in the whole set and i got it from the first pack ever sold at my gamestop i ran back in the store to show the cashiers one of the funniest lucky things that happened to me was when i randomly caught pokerus in heartgold from a krabby
pokemon,not_removed,if there is evidence today of jesus christs blessings charming shit in the world today im convinced my white cartridge would be a prime candidate ive played through the main game maybe times but within those times i have encountered four shinies via random encounter klink druddigon boldore and scrafty as well as contracting pokerus on two separate occasions gigaliths always been a favorite of mine in the shiny department too praise be jesus
pokemon,not_removed,was doing a nuzlocke in y when the first pokemon i found in the connecting cave was a shiny zubat in a horde but still later on in the game when i was in the lost hotel i had already caught a litwick when i found a shiny one so i invoked shiny clause and swapped my litwicks out turns out i was even luckier than i thought because i managed to catch the shiny litwick before it used memento
pokemon,not_removed,starting sun i was soft resetting to get a female popplio and on my soft reset i got her turns out ariel also had pokerus
pokemon,not_removed,the even munchlaxsnorlax helped me out in several trials by spamming metronome
pokemon,not_removed,i hatched a shiny dratini from my first egg with ivs
pokemon,not_removed,found myself a shiny eevee while sosgrinding for an umbreon certainly made that romp worth it considering adrenaline orbs werent available for me in shops yet by that time
pokemon,not_removed,was playing flora sky had an adamant torterra a modest camerupt and a modest shaymin i had no idea wtf natures even did back then though i shouldve know something when my level something numel was one shotting level and low with fire blast my cousin saw my team he freaked the fuck out ive never had natures that lucky every again it made a harder then normal game sooo much easier
pokemon,not_removed,til protect can be used more than once i thought it always failed if you used it consecutively since i never saw it work twice in a row
pokemon,not_removed,heres all my luck with pokemon so far i was walking on hg and found a shiny tangela thats it i guess i dont even like tangela
pokemon,not_removed,got pokerus on my ingame team from my wishiwashi no it wasnt through trading it was in the wild
pokemon,not_removed,i transfered everything i had in leaf green to emeraldand it turns out a random oddish i caught for dex had pokérus alsotorkoal in fiery pathstill have that beautiful turtle
pokemon,not_removed,the enemy used hypnosis and missed
pokemon,not_removed,i was in a competitive battle and getting my ass handed too me my last pokémon was a bisharp my opponent had two pokémon left i landed guillotine two times in a row and won the match i could taste the rage in the air
pokemon,not_removed,ive found so many shiny pokémon at this point that ive grown numb to seeing them magnemite eevee flabebe geodude graveler heatran a few whismurs ralts zubat roggenrola gible im way too lucky
pokemon,not_removed,i just learned about shines a little while after i got oras i was hoping to hunt for one dexnav later nothing so then i run into the wild grass to take a look at my new groudon boom shiny lombre
pokemon,not_removed,either my shiny needle early in my playthrough or that i was able to get a lv salamence in sun after about hours of trying to get a bagon to call for help
pokemon,not_removed,having the enemy in the battle tree miss with blizzard or actually any move with low accuracy that misses
pokemon,not_removed,i got shiny rowlets in a row and two full odds shiny in the middle of class within a month
pokemon,not_removed,i actually did get two shinies in a row in white i got a shiny audino first then almost immediately after got a shiny garboder
pokemon,not_removed,
pokemon,not_removed,first wonder trade ever lvl shiny arceus
pokemon,not_removed,dude i dont believe you there is no way that happened
pokemon,not_removed,now you just have to hope the next one doesnt have freaking av on amirite
pokemon,not_removed,i bet it had zero ivs though lucky for luckers hyper training exists now
pokemon,not_removed,wow stroke of luck
pokemon,not_removed,this sounds hilarious
pokemon,not_removed,i love how you randomly got it and had to confirm with everyone that the whole thing wasnt some drunken delusion
pokemon,not_removed,oooh sounds spoopy
pokemon,not_removed,damn mudsdale is a great pokemon too enjoy those orange donkeys
pokemon,not_removed,i vaguely remember that thing being so hard to battle
pokemon,not_removed,i thought it was one too then i noticed larvesta and thought legendaries cant evolve pew this guy came along afterwards however i didnt know absol wasnt a legendary until arkmon series that said that no legendaries were in and an absol was tamed
pokemon,not_removed,no they definitely did i remember one story of how someone got a wrong colored totodile and reset their gameboy thinking the game was messed up
pokemon,not_removed,holy shit the real world one thats my soulsilver one on steroids
pokemon,not_removed,awesome please tell me you were able to catch it
pokemon,not_removed,wow to think you had both of the correct ids
pokemon,not_removed,happy anniversary
pokemon,not_removed,i bet you regret neglecting that egg
pokemon,not_removed,this pretty much happened to me i felt like giggling when it happened
pokemon,not_removed,pics or it didnt happen
pokemon,not_removed,dont worry itll happen again ive never found a random shiny all of them were hunted for
pokemon,not_removed,dont worry i have bad luck as well the best thing that has ever happened is probably protect working three times in a row im serious never once saw a shiny and almost always protect fails the second time around did have some pretty nice tcg luck though
pokemon,not_removed,damn youve got really good shiny luck
pokemon,not_removed,go for oshawott next and post it on rshinypokemon and see how many people say relevant username
pokemon,not_removed,if at first you dont succeed give up never thought that joke term would actually be something im glad to hear i dont think the soulsilver actually works on my though now im glad i didnt sell my mario anniversary dsi for bucks to gamestop
pokemon,not_removed,wow this boggles my mind if this is before gen that actually exceeds the odds of winning the powerball basically youre pretty damn lucky what game and which ones
pokemon,not_removed,the pokemon that show up are based partly on the last area with wild pokemon you were in and the rest on the characters at certain positions of your ot name so that means your name is what caused the charmeleon to appear
pokemon,not_removed,wow thats a good bewear i bet it benefits from trick room pretty well also the post that you linked to is removed i see the comments but not the contents of the post i saw it has to do with makuhita though
pokemon,not_removed,sweet
pokemon,not_removed,aww he must feel pretty special to you whats his name
pokemon,not_removed,wow youve gotten more rng in these games than ive gotten in mine and ive been playing since gen i bet the guys behind the counter were pretty jealous p
pokemon,not_removed,its about a coin flip on the second time then it halves its chance every turn on the third turn on the etc
pokemon,not_removed,if it was lenoras watchog then this isnt real
pokemon,not_removed,holy shit this is great
pokemon,not_removed,awesome what was your reaction
pokemon,not_removed,jesus
pokemon,not_removed,that was hacked arceus is shiny locked cant be shiny via legitimate means
pokemon,not_removed,i was using a ditto so it had decent ivs but i hyper trained it anyway praise be blissey bases
pokemon,not_removed,i lost myself for a bit i did catch it but there was panic when i realised how much total pp registeel has in or and how many dusk balls i had thrown
pokemon,not_removed,i think thats the part that needs to be highlighted i was genuinely worried that i wanted it so bad that the drunk made me believe i had found it i remember waking up the next day opening my just to make sure the whole event wasnt a dream as well
pokemon,not_removed,no hyper realistic blood unfortunately i just used to over abuse the missingno glitch constantly to farm xp and to double my items eventually i had done it enough where i started encountering trainers in battle along with other shapes of missingno this part is a common occurrence depending on certain values what made it different was that the moment the missingno trainer sent out a glitched nidorina the battle music changed to this very minimal and unsettling series of music notes that played in long periods of silence between one another the battle itself ended with the game freezing and the gameboy hissing when a few trainers in the missingno trainer tried to send out some unholy amalgamation of trainermissingno sprites as one of its pokemon the save file eventually corrupted a few months later though i dont think those incidents were related
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i used one on my story team and the other one is just sitting around sadly neither of them have stamina
pokemon,not_removed,and now look we got solgaleolunala the only reason volcarona doesnt count is because its stats are too low
pokemon,not_removed,holy shit imagine just that
pokemon,not_removed,sadly no i wasnt given any pokeballs yet that time
pokemon,not_removed,something tells me he probably wasnt if it was the very first
pokemon,not_removed,i wonder trade a lot at that point in time i had about or so pokémon with unique id
pokemon,not_removed,my thought was its getting late theres no way i got another
pokemon,not_removed,oras and the shinies are growlithe makuhita and shinx
pokemon,not_removed,i guess a mod must have removed it without letting me know heres a copy from the source i really lucked out on this one the very first wild makuhita i ever encountered turned out to be a shiny and he actually ran right up to me and initiated the battle himself not only did it have an so hes competitively viable oh and he happened to be holding a black belt too what are the odds of that my very first shiny encounter ever was a shiny makuhita back in pokemon ruby not including red gyarados that is but that particular incident i was letting my cousin play he rushed over to me and told me that there was an offcolored pokemon and asked what it was about and i excitedly took the gameboy to look at what he found yet all that was there was a regular makuhita confused i asked him what he was talking about and he responded well arent they supposed to have red gloves when it dawned on me what had happened i was a bit devastated but didnt blame him i explained to him what shiny pokemon were and told him not to worry about it that one day ill have another chance at catching a shiny makuhita i guess that day is today i was going to do a run with only alolan pokemon this time around but i think ill make an exception for sumo
pokemon,not_removed,haha he does his name is shine original i know but i guess i didnt really think too much about it at the time and was too excited to see him in my party already given how golden shiny shinx are i suppose it suits him though
pokemon,not_removed,yeah im very surprised actually that i never saw it or i guess noticed since it had to have happened at least once in my years of play it happening twice in a row when battling the elite specially since its
pokemon,not_removed,i freaked out like hell the adrenaline was amazing
pokemon,not_removed,oh i knew that it was still hype though just to use in game though well technically there was a shiny arceus even in japan but it was still probably hacked
pokemon,not_removed,pokemon like these are why hyper training exists
pokemon,not_removed,glad you caught that cobalt registeel
pokemon,not_removed,if they have a good nature they can still be used ability capsule can switch a mons ability converting own tempo to stamina
pokemon,not_removed,to be fair do cosmog and cosmoem really count they cant really battle unless you have statusweatherhazards to do chip damage
pokemon,not_removed,actually no you can get a larvesta egg on route
pokemon,not_removed,no volcarona doesnt count because its not a legendary its just a normal pokemon it can breed and be found normally in the wild
pokemon,not_removed,i downloaded emerald on my phone and decided i would play with only pokémon you could catch early on i ran into a shiny poochyna before i got any poke balls and was so mad that i had to faint it it was only the second shiny ive encountered since playing since rby first came out first was a tangela in gsc that fled after i missed a hypnosis i have bad luck even when im lucky
pokemon,not_removed,aww thats awesome i hope you let your cousin know that all is forgiven
pokemon,not_removed,the national pokédex will show you i think its got a shiny aura around legendsmythicals and apparently the dilemma of phione has finally been answered
pokemon,not_removed,i meant now not back in bw volcarona has a gender though which doesnt really make it count either honestly i dont know what type of pokemon ill call it its not a psuedo its not a legendary but its way stronger than most fully evolved pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,at least it was a poocheyna
pokemon,not_removed,heatran has a gender as well
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i still think golden mighteyna looks cool though
pokemon,not_removed,rpokemongo
pokemon,not_removed,you cant even trade the new mythics on the gts so even though i have extras
pokemon,not_removed,for the future you can actually choose to opt out of seeing mythical pokemon requests when you search you still see things like level and under zekrom but its far less annoying then seeing everyone with a bunnelby asking for a volcanion
pokemon,not_removed,rpokemontrades rcasual pokemontrades rrelaxedpokemontrades
pokemon,not_removed,wait how
pokemon,not_removed,when youre refining your search there should be a little button in the bottom left hand corner that says something like settings if you click it you can tell it to not include special pokemon and it does truly cut down on the clutter edit i cannot do a grammar
pokemon,not_removed,pulverizing pancake
pokemon,not_removed,the stores that released x and y early were not supposed to if i remember correctly the stores actually got in trouble for doing so anyways outside of the us there are places giving figurines and such for preordering them i dont think anywhere in the us has anything yet which is surprising
pokemon,not_removed,thats not a preorder bonus anyone that buys the game before january gets it
pokemon,not_removed,gotchya
pokemon,not_removed,it would need to have graphics and music that i would rate a an extensive postgame where you could travel several new towns or even a new region something like the battle frontier or the pokemon world tournament done really well entertaining minigamessidequests like the pokeathlon or pokemon contests a large number of pokemon you could catchtrain in game im talking pokemon id also like something like the pokeradar or the dexnav a plot thats still simplistic enough but very well written memorable characters interesting new updates to game mechanics moves and movesets basically something that would keep the metagame turning its gears if it was a debut game i would like new pokemon based on very interesting realworld or mythological creatures trainers that arent extremely hard but would still need a bit of thinking to battle effectively unsuprisingly my favorite games are currently hgss and i havent played sun and moon yet though
pokemon,not_removed,well since sm are prob my current favorites id say just stick with the trend were on but bring back some old features a way to grind easier blissey bases please a post game battle facility with more options than singledoublemulti battle frontier something like the friend safari from xy so i can get the starters in non standard pokeballs little stuff like that well battle frontier isnt little but still
pokemon,not_removed,be a sinnoh remake
pokemon,not_removed,a deep involved story with a smooth ui and decent relative challenge
pokemon,not_removed,a tutorial that doesnt take hours to complete
pokemon,not_removed,dexnav back more post game a leveling area like blissey bases keep a lot of the stuff sun and moon did like no hms iv judge in pc remove festival
pokemon,not_removed,an amazing story favorite games currently tied between bw and sm
pokemon,not_removed,give me a unique region with great music and a story that is interesting from beginning to end
pokemon,not_removed,my ideal game would have walking with your pokémon a regional pokédex with literally every pokémon so your team can be anything the only post game ones being some legendaries a battle frontier a pwt a challenge mode a la around new pokémon several new regional variants new mega evolutions new zmoves an engaging plot an interesting region id love australia the return of pokéride a cast of nonflat characters both totem pokémon and gym leaders the title defender feature for postgame league battles the and championship challengers to actually use six pokémon secret bases trainer customization new pokédex entries for every pokémon a la sun and moon and a good soundtrack thatd basically be a dream come true and while it sounds like a lot i honestly dont think its too much work for game freak to do this theres certainly been games much more ambitious than this
pokemon,not_removed,i want another game to have that soft reboot well i guess every game after black and white is sorta a soft reboot like black and white where theres tons of pokémon and you can only encounter new pokémon until postgame black and white were my first main series pokémon games and it was a perfect title to start with too before i thought that every pokémon game was like black and white where only pokémon of that region were available until postgame and honestly when x and y came out and it had such little new pokémon compared to bw i was kinda disappointed and the only reason i was very slightly disappointed with the so close to perfect games that are sun and moon is because gamefreak revealed like every pokémon beforehand they are still my favorites to date along with black and white ahh i still remember the hype for those games like it was yesterday truly iconic haha and honestly i cant wait for pokémon black and white in to come out
pokemon,not_removed,something similar to the pwt platinum remake more variety new fav im very boring other stuff id like is the ability to change natures and an easy way to once youve beaten the game
pokemon,not_removed,how do you even pick a favourite i have first game love for white my favourite feature is the dexnav from oras and i love the graphics in sunmoon if they could make a white remake with the dexnav and gen graphics that would probably become my favourite though also ifwhen gen is remade i really hope you can buy one cartridge that has either both white and white or black and black as separate saves so you can play both without having to buy remakes to get them all
pokemon,not_removed,another region that i could go to
pokemon,not_removed,stay the same but keep the old cries alolan forms can keep the updated ones
pokemon,not_removed,let your decisions actually affect the story
pokemon,not_removed,story with content would be the best game also xds tutorial
pokemon,not_removed,get rid of the fairy type
pokemon,not_removed,i like the friend safari but it does make it hard when your friend list is full and you dont know which ones you have as a safari or not i wish it was so that there was one safari of each type or something and you just unlocked different pokemon in it by connecting with someone once and then you had that pokemon forever even if you removed the friend card
pokemon,not_removed,ever heard of ruby the only game with a plot that isnt the usual childish bad guys
pokemon,not_removed,also let you have a gym that is acknowledged as yours even if you dont do anything with it i just want the feeling
pokemon,not_removed,geez your dad must called you tinkerbell when you were young this is like the second thread i see where you post your dislike of fairies
pokemon,not_removed,team magma and aqua are my two favorite villain teams in the series
pokemon,not_removed,i quite like fairies in other media tinkerbell being one of my favorites as peter pan is one of my favorite stories i just dont think the fairy types has any business in pokémon
pokemon,not_removed,at least we had a different matter to focus on during the game
pokemon,not_removed,most likely zekrom i mean just look at my flair but possibly zygarde actually if pokémon existed i believe i would either be a sparetime researcher or a pokémon photographer with a blog i would absolutely love to meet zygarde and study how it lives where it lives its biology its physical appearance as well as its ability to see through its cells and call upon them to transform into other formes i understand that zygarde would be timid and maybe even territorial but if i could find even just a single cell and study it and take quality pictures of it it would make my life complete and i mean who wouldnt wanna meet zydoge maybe yveltal too depending on how aggressive it would be by nature its role in the world is to keep species from overpopulating so it definitely isnt evil just because its ability is to kill but if it isnt territorial and aggressive then i think it would be an amazing pokémon meet and quite beautiful to take some action pictures of other than that just some beautiful legendaries that doesnt live in the ocean i dont wanna commence to being a seafarer or a fisherman just to snap pictures of kyogre something like xerneas hooh shaymin and the like
pokemon,not_removed,legendary jolteon i mean raikou
pokemon,not_removed,that sounds amazing man
pokemon,not_removed,nothing like a saber
pokemon,not_removed,rip english
pokemon,not_removed,no because they arent in the alola pokedex
pokemon,not_removed,they arent allowed for vgc they are allowed for other formats though
pokemon,not_removed,ash greninja was a demo transfer so its not from sun and moon technically island scan pokemon are allowed last i heard they are in the core game assuming they arent banned for whatever battle type you choose
pokemon,not_removed,at first i was thinking thats harsh maybe op doesnt speak english then it was op and i got a good chuckle
pokemon,not_removed,thank you
pokemon,not_removed,thx for the help
pokemon,not_removed,lol
pokemon,not_removed,good to know what todd snap is up to these days
pokemon,not_removed,nope
pokemon,not_removed,sick
pokemon,not_removed,rpokemongosnap
pokemon,not_removed,rtitlegore
pokemon,not_removed,so basically pokemon snap go nice
pokemon,not_removed,take a seat over there
pokemon,not_removed,i keep seeing fanart of mimikyu and thinking aww how adorable and then its gonna show up in game with some super dark dex entry god damnit in all honesty though this is really adorable
pokemon,not_removed,same im thinking itll be a depressing entry thanks
pokemon,not_removed,i have a feeling the dex entries will just be shortened versions of the description on the sunmoon website
pokemon,not_removed,im calling it now i swear to god someones going to make a theory about it wearing the skins of pokémon it has killed and then all the fanart will be ruined for me why must this game be so fucked up why must this fanart be so adorable
pokemon,not_removed,oh its been done already if you dont ever want to sleep again heres one from an earlier thread
pokemon,not_removed,well on the official pokémon site ist says something only read in german if you see his true appearance under under his disguise you get a disease
pokemon,not_removed,jesus fucking christ the game isnt even out yet
pokemon,not_removed,fans will be fans
pokemon,not_removed,hey you found the secret of the gs ball
pokemon,not_removed,its icegaleo landorus unbound dead weavile bat and snakeus
pokemon,not_removed,haha some vague hemidigimon creatures
pokemon,not_removed,geez the alchemy theory isnt about the series end its about the mythology religion and literature that inspired sun moon and the entire mega evolution storyarc that xy started yes that one pokétuber said they would reboot the franchise after sm but no they wont in the sense that everything mistakenly took it for the franchise wont end no one is even remotely believing that if anything theyll make a gen v esque reboot nothing more
pokemon,not_removed,stop making pointless speculation we have no idea what will happen or which games will be remade
pokemon,not_removed,if theyre gonna make a reboot they will most likely do another gen thing pokemon is not going anywhere guys plus if they wanted to end the series they wouldve most like did it in gen how bigger of a situation can make that can outshine meeting the creator of the very universe
pokemon,not_removed,why would they stop making pokemon games they have a ton of fans itll stop when people arent buying them anymore
pokemon,not_removed,if this is pointless so is every starter evo concept post if any game is going to be remade dp would be it theyve been in order so far
pokemon,not_removed,gen wasnt even so much intended to be a reboot as much as it was intended to be a way to bring together fans and players of all ages on even footing anyway at least according to masuda i believe it was
pokemon,not_removed,no because at least people are speculating about evolutions that have been confirmed to exist games beyond sun and moon havent been confirmed yet and for all we know the pokemon company is going to stop producing games after sun and moon to focus on the rest of the media empire theyve created if theyve been in order so far then the next games to be remade are firered and leafgreen since they were the next games after ruby and sapphire im personally looking forward to blazing fire red and shady leaf green
pokemon,not_removed,well i guess the karma speaks for itself kid
pokemon,not_removed,i dont think remakes of remakes count buddy lol
pokemon,not_removed,in order of generation not actual games plus you dont remake a remake
pokemon,not_removed,how can you say theres no other game in order they start to plan the new game since the current generation is released gf are not the ones who procude the anime and other medias they can coordinate something here and there to give coherence to the franchise but pokemon is primarly a game and everything that is procuced is basedinspired on game so if the games stop being produced the franchise will probably die gf staff if i remember well masuda said that theyll keep producing new games as far people keep buying dp remake is the probable next remake and not firered leafgreen but i think itll be in generation not now
pokemon,not_removed,why cant this guy speculate where he thinks the franchise could go from here exactly also if you legit think that the order of remakes would go back to red and green then by that logic the loop restarts there and we would never get a remake of anything past rubysapphire of course the next game up for remake is diamond and pearl not that i think it will happen anytime soon
pokemon,not_removed,iirc despite how massive it is wailord can fit in a pokémon center there was a comic about it though idk how legitimate the screenshot in said comic was
pokemon,not_removed,he is bigger than anyone on the hoenn gen vi how to is he gonna fit in a pokémon center hes or so
pokemon,not_removed,this is false refer to the bulbapedia page where they name drop wailord large pokémon such as wailord will be sent back to their poké balls as well when entering most buildings as they are too large
pokemon,not_removed,ah thought it wouldve been fake
pokemon,not_removed,i want to believe you but something tells me youre lion
pokemon,not_removed,we are the the crystal memes
pokemon,not_removed,the same pun thrice
pokemon,not_removed,cmon r hes just trying to lion the mood
pokemon,not_removed,it will be even funnier if they do it again
pokemon,not_removed,lion the mood
pokemon,not_removed,someone previously pointed out that sylveon is lower levelled than all of the rest of the eeveelutions likely because the young girl doesnt know how to train the sylveon i enjoyed how real this game is people do get hurt and are constantly struggling with elements of their lives the way these struggles were shown as even adults having problems was priceless to me seeing these problems embraced and moving on to the next stage of life was perfectly expressed difficult burdens like your own mortality can be stared down and not dissuade a person from pushing on
pokemon,not_removed,this game was full of sad dialogue like that machamp on poni island whose trainer retracted it into its pokeball before he died in a car crash
pokemon,not_removed,yeah battling those trainers made me feel like a dick i kind of wish there were more side quests like this after completing the story though
pokemon,not_removed,the saddest part is when kagetora himself gives up and resumes back to just being a cashier and gives away his best item
pokemon,not_removed,yes it is sad but upon reflection i think its more bittersweet than just sad for in a way every one of those trainers has some sort of closure after the battle
pokemon,not_removed,yeah especially how each of them makes a comment about growing old that really hits players aligned with that type the flareonuser talking about burning down to ash the umbreonuser talking about the inevitable dawn the leafeonuser talking about how all flowers wither its pretty deep stuff coming from game freak
pokemon,not_removed,this quest god right in the feels man feelsbadman
pokemon,not_removed,really reminded me that im hurtling towards the grave at an alarming speed
pokemon,not_removed,and they are the same trainers from gold and silver thats why they are all so old and have alzheimers and shit
pokemon,not_removed,is that what it was i just assumed because sylveon was the newest eeveelution
pokemon,not_removed,someone previously pointed out that sylveon is lower levelled than all of the rest of the eeveelutions likely because the young girl doesnt know how to train the sylveon i actually hadnt thought of it that way i had assumed it was trying to show that sakura was the same age as kagetora as opposed to the other trainers some of whom referred to him as a kid so i assumed they were much older at the time but that makes more sense
pokemon,not_removed,that was on melemele not poni
pokemon,not_removed,i actually saw that lady while trying to find the umbreon user in the same area at first i thought it was her husband that was the umbreon user and that he never actually came back from the dead like the rumors suggested and she was actually pretending to be the umbreon user after he died to carry his legacy or something looking back that didnt really fit the whole feel of the eevee mission but they still could have gone that route dealing with change isnt on the same level as coping with loss but they are interconnected
pokemon,not_removed,lets get something straight its in the hauoli cemetery on melemele island only accessible at night after completely halas grand trial but you are right it was very sad
pokemon,not_removed,it depended on the trainer for me there are people that were happy you fought them since it reminded them of the good old days which i was really happy about then there were the ones that were annoyed or upset about it since they felt you were just forcing them to fight you but it did allow closure for the eevee trainer to let him know how everyone else was doing it would be great if they came together for a final reunion or something once you met all of them
pokemon,not_removed,and then he just becomes a normal cashier npc indistinguishable from all the the other nameless identical npcs forever repeating the same line hi welcome to the thrifty megamart
pokemon,not_removed,i think it was nice that kagetora got closure all this time he was living with regrets about not being able to measure up to the eevee users but when he finally learned what became of them he realized that he was actually better off than most of them were although hes stuck in a deadend job he has a wife and a child and a lot to live for we essentially helped kagetora get over his midlife crisis i think the takeaway from this whole sidequest is that we dream big when we are young when we get older we have to come to terms with the fact that not all of us can fulfill those dreams sometimes our dreams even change as our priorities change and theres nothing wrong with that maybe you cant be the hero that you always dreamed of being when you were a kid but when you have kids of your own you can be their hero
pokemon,not_removed,it may be that very old mons also lose levels if they arent trained for years or something but that would be speculation with no basis if we go there
pokemon,not_removed,it was postgame right either that or i have to have a machamp already because it wasnt there the first time
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure shes hapus grandma
pokemon,not_removed,its probably partly down to the order i challenged them it went from i remember eevee guy to i dont really want to fight to i have alzheimers and jolteon is my only companion to granny is dead and silveon is all i have to remember her by none of it stopped me one hit koing every one of them i left them crying over their fainted pet just for a stupid crystal i will never use
pokemon,not_removed,i think you have to be on the machamp ride and at night but yes its on melemele
pokemon,not_removed,you dont have to be on machamp yourself simply a night only thing
pokemon,not_removed,at night i see so its like that one with the police officer and the unruly mon that gives you frustration i think right
pokemon,not_removed,id like one if youre just doing first to reply
pokemon,not_removed,ok so the first two people that can correctly guess my favorite legendary pokemon one for each legendary gets a code one guess per person and you only have to correctly pick one edit raikou was one of them the person to correctly guess the second one wins the last code
pokemon,not_removed,darkrai
pokemon,not_removed,mewtwo
pokemon,not_removed,shaymin is my guess
pokemon,not_removed,mew
pokemon,not_removed,hm moltres
pokemon,not_removed,heatran
pokemon,not_removed,well that was fast haha the codes have been given away thanks everyone
pokemon,not_removed,its a jackal
pokemon,not_removed,sorry i just posted the requirements good luck
pokemon,not_removed,raikou azelf
pokemon,not_removed,winner
pokemon,not_removed,you are gross in how fast you did that well thats one code gone
pokemon,not_removed,you were correct with the raikou
pokemon,not_removed,i used reference photos i was practicing strokes and color trying to see how accurately i could recreate it
pokemon,not_removed,recreating another drawing by eye isnt tracing expecting someone to remember every detail about a pokemon off the top of their head without practice is ridiculous recreating other drawings helps to get comfortable with those features so you can start drawing them in original poses eventually
pokemon,not_removed,if it has rock head and head smash i think you would need it to learn head smash much further down the level up list than that thing would be op as fuuuuuuck stab head smash at with no recoil makes the game no fun
pokemon,not_removed,moves that hit multiple pokemon are going to be extremely powerful in normal multibattles you have to mitigate hitting your own pokemon but earthquake spam seems indiscriminately good in br
pokemon,not_removed,mega glalie with refrigerate explosion as well as explosion lickylicky and selfdestruct snorlax with normal gems will be some very easy ways to attempt cleaning the field as such protect and explosion resistant pokémon will see a ton of usage hoopas hyperspace holefury will be very powerful with their ability to go through protect i can see imprison being useful since the user can prevent the other pokémon from using protect if the user has it azelf could use this strategy decently since it has a really good speed with a strong explosion but landorust is where its truly at intimidate to weaken the enemies imprison to dismantle their protection a strong earthquake to throw around that hits the whole field and as a powerful finale explosion coming from base attack stat to clean the unprotected field with a burst of massive power teeter dance would be evil and dark void would be satanic
pokemon,not_removed,im sensing priority moves to snipe kills are gonna be a huge thing too especially extreme speed as its priority
pokemon,not_removed,keep calm and check intentions run protect on everything
pokemon,not_removed,refrigerate explosion will instantly become the norm in this new meta alongside protect
pokemon,not_removed,choice scarf destiny bond it currently doesnt work super well in ffas because if your partner attacks you it doesnt kill them
pokemon,not_removed,im looking forward dark void just becuase
pokemon,not_removed,rocky helmet ferrothorn has to be fun in case you can make switches
pokemon,not_removed,stealth rocks everywhere
pokemon,not_removed,power trick shuckle with sticky webs
pokemon,not_removed,im looking forward to using bisharp since im sure theyll be alot of intimidates about allowing me to get an easy ko with sucker punch storm drain lightning rod users will be fun to try and save a teammate while magic bounce users will also be funevil to use ive enjoyed hearing about the battle royal i love pokemon ffa so i cant wait to get stuck into it
pokemon,not_removed,air ballon and dig on dugtrio just in case you get eqd while your underground itll hit after the protect and take you off the field for a turn plus that speed and arena trap
pokemon,not_removed,im gonna use the four corner pokemon we saw in the background charizard gyarados haxorus and tyranitar just because i want to that porygonz seems fun that manaphy does not
pokemon,not_removed,spam earthquake surf dazzling gleam petal blizzard etc
pokemon,not_removed,so heres my take on things that could happen just to note i have very little experience in competitive battles so dont expect anything really amazing also note that a lot of this could be completely null and void if game freak makes it so that certain moves only affects enemies to your left and right and not straight across from you using skill swap on an enemy with a bad ability and giving it to somebody else would be a pretty interesting idea although if thats not a viable strategy in standard doubles or tipples then im not sure how it would work out here you could probably annoy a lot of people with a sandstorm or a hailstorm you will need a diverse team seriously in these battles you will go up against nine pokémon in total god forbid anybody uses flash encore and taunt could cause some pretty interesting situations swagger would be especially annoying as it could confuse everybody and raise the attack of people who really want to get rid of you there are also some pretty obvious ones such as earthquake spam in any case thats just about all i can think of
pokemon,not_removed,text glitch ios only its a bug not a feature
pokemon,not_removed,its called missingno wants to play a part of this
pokemon,not_removed,try beating the elite four again
pokemon,not_removed,ok thanks ill try that and report if it works
pokemon,not_removed,thats what worked in oras so hopefully it works best of luck
pokemon,not_removed,did it work
pokemon,not_removed,havent tried yet my daughter owns the game lol
pokemon,not_removed,it worked thanks so much
pokemon,not_removed,i believe alola form pokemon have a different background same with when they evolve
pokemon,not_removed,yeah i also noticed it my muk had a green background while the others had red
pokemon,not_removed,ah so its for differentiating between alola and kanto forms when they become available
pokemon,not_removed,were you unaware that the pokemon bayleaf was named after the herb bay leaf i dont see any other thing in the picture
pokemon,not_removed,rpokepuns
pokemon,not_removed,theyre too busy demonetizing videos that have swear wordsviolence in them
pokemon,not_removed,this is what youtube heroes is supposed to be for
pokemon,not_removed,yep thats pretty blatant poor uranium
pokemon,not_removed,jesus it really cant get more blatant if they smashed the screen with rip off
pokemon,not_removed,just reported them all i suggest you guys do the same and we raise a shitstorm maybe youtube might finally realize that this pisses people off
pokemon,not_removed,this policy is gonna lead to the death of youtube since they have this puritanical stick up their behinds
pokemon,not_removed,and badvideo tags
pokemon,not_removed,ummmm they can
pokemon,not_removed,step grab a step grab an pokemon game before sumo compatible with it step insert game into step look for pokemart
pokemon,not_removed,unless they play orasor any pregen games
pokemon,not_removed,he blocked me lol i have about time to cash in lmao
pokemon,not_removed,i should have offered to sell him a few for a a piece like go ahead buddy resell them lol
pokemon,not_removed,i bet ive got one in much better condition just sitting in a box in my room somewhere
pokemon,not_removed,good remix now that i think about it its my favorite bicycling song
pokemon,not_removed,it would mean so much if you guys could give me some support on this channel
pokemon,not_removed,gen had the best music by a landslide and i know its not just me since even agrees
pokemon,not_removed,same i really was trying to make use of the celesta the bells to make it sound like shooting stars
pokemon,not_removed,just a heads up i am at work and wouldnt be able to reveal codes until around pm central or tomorrow morningafternoon
pokemon,not_removed,you cant unfortunately trade these here
pokemon,not_removed,i cant just pick people to give the codes to that want them
pokemon,not_removed,on mobile my fault
pokemon,not_removed,you can yeah ps ill take one p
pokemon,not_removed,making new post hold up
pokemon,not_removed,actually no you cant its against the rules there is a seperate giveaway code for this specifically on the sidebar
pokemon,not_removed,the competitive scene utilizes evs and ivs hidden stats ivs are hidden evs can be viewed that bolster a pokemons strengths when used correctly certain pokemon shrug off hits and even powerful moves dont bug them its a little complex i recommend googling evs and ivs to get a better idea
pokemon,not_removed,the trainers when playing though a game are essentially stock while other players and the battle mansions have full on competitive pokemon as someone else said it has to do with evs and ivs
pokemon,not_removed,this seems appropriate
pokemon,not_removed,i guess ill have to do my research i knew evs and ivs were a thing but didnt know they impacted it this much this is serious work you gotta put in to get a competitive pokemon is there an advantage to training a pokemon up to level since it resets everyone to in a battle
pokemon,not_removed,yep looks accurate to me nice
pokemon,not_removed,certain moves are locked to higher levels outside of that theres no difference
pokemon,not_removed,exam
pokemon,not_removed,test
pokemon,not_removed,test
pokemon,not_removed,seem interesting ill keep an eye out for this
pokemon,not_removed,what exactly is a communitylocke do we just pass a rom from person to person or what
pokemon,not_removed,you forgot to put frlg and hgss on the list
pokemon,not_removed,looks great mate
pokemon,not_removed,interested
pokemon,not_removed,no we all play through at the same time
pokemon,not_removed,use the survey in the edited portion
pokemon,not_removed,ah sounds like an interesting idea so for example we all make it to the first gym by x date right
pokemon,not_removed,no just play through at roughly the same time i tried the whole deadline thing with just one deadline for beating the game and like no one managed to reach it this is going to be a nice relaxed play through with the same rules as a bunch of other people its recommended that you share how your run is going so people can compare and have fun but you dont have to
pokemon,not_removed,alright sounds like fun
pokemon,not_removed,it feels like its harder to earn tokens than it is to lose them is it minus one token if you enter a pokemon center or if you talk to the nurse and heal your pokemon what are your rules on berries like oran berries and leppa berries
pokemon,not_removed,it would be hard to keep track of tokens though
pokemon,not_removed,only to heal the pokemon berries are free game frankly you could cheat and deposit your team in the pc for a heal but like all lockes thats on the honor system and its supposed to be harder to earn them otherwise there is no point to it
pokemon,not_removed,anyone playing can keep a notepad or sticky note by them even if not most if not all phones have countersmemo apps that can be used for this considering most players have paper to keep track of routes encountered already the token noting is not an issue
pokemon,not_removed,they arent released yet along with ditto mew mewtwo
pokemon,not_removed,already confirmed that its just the models
pokemon,not_removed,the pokédex shows three legendary birds the shade
pokemon,not_removed,placeholders are a magical thing you know
pokemon,not_removed,awesome they arent released yet their models are in the game but not released yet so you cant catch them
pokemon,not_removed,the dex always shows slots for all pokemon up to the highestnumbered one youve caught
pokemon,not_removed,pyukumuku
pokemon,not_removed,if your henning i guess shiny celebi
pokemon,not_removed,i did something like this a few months before came out did a number poll on and if the users number was picked via rng then their named pokemon was on my team for a final run on or remember ending up with stantler tympole growlithe froakie shroomish mareep as my team to get through the game aha if youre picking a team one by one i nominate bidoof
pokemon,not_removed,lickilicky never seen anybody use one in a playthrough
pokemon,not_removed,i vote azumarill
pokemon,not_removed,speed boost venipede
pokemon,not_removed,sunkern
pokemon,not_removed,shiny dunsparce for something goofy
pokemon,not_removed,you should pick the highest upvoted ones and dont evolve them if theyre unevolved i pick magikarp
pokemon,not_removed,smeargle setup for a magikarp sweep
pokemon,not_removed,one legendary picked
pokemon,not_removed,bidoof is now my weak one
pokemon,not_removed,ill use the smeargle
pokemon,not_removed,woooooo all hail the might bidoof i want updates on this playthrough
pokemon,not_removed,ill post a summary every couple of trials and notify you in the comments
pokemon,not_removed,you cant just scan a qr code someone gives you you need to go to the teams page and generate your own qr code for it siiiigh gamefreak why dont you just understand the definition of convenience
pokemon,not_removed,guess rpokemonqrcodes will be populated again
pokemon,not_removed,sub needs a team qr megathread
pokemon,not_removed,how can i create my own qr code i already synced my save file but i cant find it on my profile page
pokemon,not_removed,rental teams make it easy to practice and prepare like never before but when it comes time for a real competition youll have to put together your own team—rental teams arent allowed in formal tournaments this is a bit disappointing was hoping we could avoid the monotony of breeding all together still being able to practice ala pokemon showdown at least allows you to test out your team before you spend time creating and this is only for official tournaments too so you can skip right to the actual battling for online randoms
pokemon,not_removed,neat thanks for the post pokepal
pokemon,not_removed,i guess pokemon battle youtubers can put their team in a qr and viewers can use
pokemon,not_removed,finally
pokemon,not_removed,such a cool feature to have in game despite the slightly convoluted process of getting the code perhaps its a security measure that you have to go through their website for a qr code
pokemon,not_removed,theres no restrictions to using these for the battle tree in terms of rewards is there ive already got the three stamps so im not overly concerned there but im waiting on people who get streaks of to start posting ultra specific teams so i can get the berries for myself
pokemon,not_removed,can i use qr teams in the battle tree i need bp to get those stupid items and i hate competitive breeding
pokemon,not_removed,will you be able to use a rented team in battle spot it says that theyre not allowed in a real competition so i assume that includes live vgc tournaments and online competitions
pokemon,not_removed,been looking forward to this for a while unfortunate that we cant use it for real competitions but its better than nothing
pokemon,not_removed,thanks to a qr rental team i finally beat the normal singles in the battle tree mimikyu is sooo overpowered
pokemon,not_removed,request good doubles team so i can finally beat it without contemplating which doubles team i should start breeding through researching reddit and youtube videos
pokemon,not_removed,how do i make a team
pokemon,not_removed,you also have to game sync to see your own registered teams if you want to upload one of them which can only be done once a day i feel foolish for believing anything good might come from the global link
pokemon,not_removed,perhaps they dont want this to be convenient they want you to train your own team still i dunno
pokemon,not_removed,i made rbattlefactory after qr rental teams were announced specifically for this feature
pokemon,not_removed,rbattlefactory
pokemon,not_removed,on your profile go to qr rental team then click on the team you want to put to rent after that you find the qr code at the bottom of the page by clicking on your team
pokemon,not_removed,im more disappointed because this would solve all hacking problems ever v
pokemon,not_removed,security for what
pokemon,not_removed,from what i understand you can use them wherever it gives you the option for them without restriction you wont earn any ribbons for your pokemon i guess
pokemon,not_removed,yes you can
pokemon,not_removed,yeah pretty much youll have to use your own teams for live events and online friendly competitions but youre fine to use them on battle spot
pokemon,not_removed,the whole point of it is to test out a team before you breed it for yourself they do a well enough job preventing you from relying exclusively on qr code teams by not letting you use them in tournaments so you have to breed imo not making a qr code work how youd expect it to doesnt really motivate me more to train my own team
pokemon,not_removed,you the real map
pokemon,not_removed,first of all you have to put your pokémon in a battle box i didnt know that thats the reason why the team never showed up
pokemon,not_removed,except for completing the dex and other noncompetitive aspects that can be hacked
pokemon,not_removed,not worried there in both the tree and the maison i always just two mons designed to beat the boss at and the third is just whatever i need ribbons for after that i just swap back to the normal team
pokemon,not_removed,yay i absolutely hate competitive breeding im a shiny hunter personally this is great thanks for the info
pokemon,not_removed,still its great this will make competitive battling much more accessible this way casual players can try out playing using a rented team and possibly get hooked this will bring plenty of new players to competitve pokemon
pokemon,not_removed,fair enough
pokemon,not_removed,competitive breeding is easier than using the masuda method for a shiny or you can do both at the same time
pokemon,not_removed,idk ive tried it in the past and its just not my thing between egg moves and natures and then the ivs on top of that it just gets to be too much for me plus all of my favorite pokémon seem to be not competitively viable oh well
pokemon,not_removed,natures are super easy to deal with—just pick the nature you want and once you get a hatchling with that nature put an everstone on it and use it as the parent from then on ivs are only a hassle if you dont have a rbreedingdittosnew with a destiny knot especially since the judge feature in the pc is super easy to use out of each hatchling batch if one of them has more bests than the current parent use it as the new parent just remember to move the everstone over if youve got the right nature already egg moves arent even necessary at all for most pokémon but if you want them look on bulbapedias page for the pokémon youre breeding for—it has a list of possible parents that each egg move can be inherited from get a male of one of those species make sure its got the move breed it with a female of the target species and use the hatchling as the new parent the only big hassle in breeding competitively is when you need to chainbreed for an egg move and thats rarely necessary for any important moves theres also breeding has throw out any hatchlings without ha and dont use maleditto if you can avoid it but like the mm that takes more patience than planning
pokemon,not_removed,i personally learnt them through layers ev first battled only training ev then iv battled with ev and iv then learned abilities usefullness then learned nature and them everything sort of clicked
pokemon,not_removed,there was this one fake leak that actually had a really interesting idea of giving rowlett gale wings would be really cool if that turned out to be the case
pokemon,not_removed,more hp and less speed on litten and more speed and less defense but more speed on popplio other than that looks legit
pokemon,not_removed,litten was shown to be faster than rowlet and pikachu pikachu has a high base speed so i am guessing litten will end up the fastest of the starters
pokemon,not_removed,poplios poke dex intry implies itll be fast id switch its speed with rowlets or copy it and basing them off of the leaks as much as id like litten to be fast theres a good chance itll be slow and bulky
pokemon,not_removed,more points to littens speed and it would be perfect what would be even more perfect would be littens final evolution not being the one in the leaks
pokemon,not_removed,i am biased but i would really rather they all end up being mainly special attackers idk why but i like them a lot more than physically focused mons
pokemon,not_removed,for rowlett id take points from speed and put them in sp atk as its based on an archer so it should be good with ranged attacks for litten id take points from speed and put in hp and in sp def as tony the tiger littens final evolution doesnt seem like it would be too fast for popplio id take or points from sp atk and put them into atk since it seems like it has more physical offensive power
pokemon,not_removed,pretty interesting overall their good choices though id give rowlets final evo a bit more in sp atk honestly i think litten will evolve into a firefighting after all it completes the triangle theyre trying to make
pokemon,not_removed,given the grassflying typing it would need gale wings to keep up with the other starters if they ended up as a dark type with tough claws and sylveon except also water type edit well okay gale wings might be overshooting the mark a little bit with those stats
pokemon,not_removed,wrestlecat rules
pokemon,not_removed,i actually dont mind the leaked evolution i grew to like it
pokemon,not_removed,might be a mixed attacker for being a wrestler that tries to cheateven spits out asian mist
pokemon,not_removed,i tend to prefer special attackers too so i totally get it but i think for balance and variety reasons its good to make a physical special and mixed final evolution imho
pokemon,not_removed,who ever said theyre trying to make a type triangle not every set of starters has to do that
pokemon,not_removed,wait how would it be a triangle if fighting is weak against both flying and fairy types
pokemon,not_removed,sylveon except also water type azumarill
pokemon,not_removed,haus of the world grant me your strength
pokemon,not_removed,hau approves
pokemon,not_removed,i didnt realize malasadas were actually just jellyfilled donuts
pokemon,not_removed,so they didnt know what they were and just made jelly doughnuts what about spicy malasadas and dry malasadas bitter etc they seem to have a whole spectrum of savory to sweet i assumed one of them would be a mana pua analog perhaps mystical
pokemon,not_removed,these look really good and seem fairly easy to make as well might have to try it for myself
pokemon,not_removed,us jews just call these sufganyot or jelly donutes that we eat at hannukah
pokemon,not_removed,all the malasadas are belong to us
pokemon,not_removed,is that jimmy wong i didnt know he did stuff outside of mtg
pokemon,not_removed,of course not everyone knows jelly filled donuts are white and triangular brock taught us that
pokemon,not_removed,i used a recipe by to make my own malasadas and they came out super well this recipe looks fairly similar so id definitely say give it a shot and post photos
pokemon,not_removed,that was my reaction too my family actually bought a sufganiyot mix this past channukah that i was going to make but then jammycooks posted a malasada recipe and i figured hey this looks exactly the same might as well do it from scratch it was just like eating a sufganiya
pokemon,not_removed,name checks out also i like that you posted this the day of the team skull takeover so the us could be those bad bad boys
pokemon,not_removed,im pretty sure as long as a pokemon has a different trainer id it will get the boost
pokemon,not_removed,dont use exp share and dont play with them in pokemon refresh i dont think theres a way to turn off boosted exp gain through trade
pokemon,not_removed,in order to not get the exp boost your ot tid sid must match the pokemon so in order to do an eeveelution run you need to breed the eggs trade the eggs over to your new game and hatch the eggs in that new game the hatched eevee will have your new trainer info not the old
pokemon,not_removed,ah too bad
pokemon,not_removed,guess im gonna have to bear with the boost then that would lock out leafeon and best mon
pokemon,not_removed,all systems and games are region locked
pokemon,not_removed,they are regionlocked yes learned that the hard way with super mystery dungeon
pokemon,not_removed,gbas were region locked dss werent are
pokemon,not_removed,unfortunatly i think theyre region locked
pokemon,not_removed,i used mimikyu mega garchomp golisopod made it to battle in super single battles made like bp
pokemon,not_removed,i havent gotten to the battle tree yet so i may be wrong but wouldnt it be faster to just go to the battle royal dome with some weakunderleveled pokemon and throw the match you still get one bp for trying
pokemon,not_removed,i ran with ash greninja ev trained celesteela and alolan marowak
pokemon,not_removed,vikavolt mudsdale and silvally whatever type you want that worked well with me
pokemon,not_removed,that sounds like a good team do you mind posting moveset if you have time
pokemon,not_removed,after some testing it think this is faster so ill use this method till i have ev training items ill make a explosion team bp every turns sounds ok
pokemon,not_removed,i missed the greninja event damn but i like celesteela i just need ev training items
pokemon,not_removed,lead with mimikyu moves were zsplash shadow sneak shadow claw play rough adamant max attack sp def evs mega garchomp had earthquake crunch dragon rush poison jab jolly max attack speed evs rough skin golisopod was just my golisopod from my playthrough moves were leech life sucker punch liquidation first impression adamant mixed evs holding sitrus berry heres how i lost if you care to see enter it in the festival plaza pc
pokemon,not_removed,you can still get it from the demo
pokemon,not_removed,no you didnt just grab the free demo thats still available from the eshop and you can get grininja
pokemon,not_removed,oh wow nice ill definitely try that i didnt know mimikyu got splash that seams so powerful
pokemon,not_removed,what does zsplash do thats hilarious i didnt know it was a thing
pokemon,not_removed,is it worth having a rough skin garchomp when he just loses that ability upon mega evolving anyway
pokemon,not_removed,if you already have the demo how do you transfer greninja
pokemon,not_removed,raises attack by stages
pokemon,not_removed,i would say yes it helps when you swap into a resisted physical move i use kartana now instead of golisopod so i run into a lot of fire fangs and stuff like that i also no longer use zsplash now i use swords dance wide lens mimikyu with max attack speed
pokemon,not_removed,once you finish the demo talk to kukui in the pokemon center and he can transfer stuff including greninja
pokemon,not_removed,itll straight up tell you if your save is corrupted and the game will be unplayable forever cant even reset it if you can load the game up youre fine
pokemon,not_removed,did you eject the cartridge while the game was in the middle of saving or was it after itd finished
pokemon,not_removed,pretty sure it was right after it finished because i heard the beep it was pretty close though
pokemon,not_removed,if you heard the beep then youre alright especially since you were able to load it up with no noticeable problems
pokemon,not_removed,it all has to do with evs prior to gen v evs only applied when using vitamins or when leveling up meaning you couldnt ev train properly a level pokemon as a result of this if you get a pokemon to level with evs in a stat and lower the other stats with berries and then increase your evs to in the stat then level up you will get from the stat in addition to the normal level up bonus and the nature bonus you could probably get above in a single stat at once if you did this i think the highest i ever got was back in hgss fun fact because the bonus was calculated on level up you can actually get a negative bonus to your stat and if the stat is hp you could faint your last living pokemon and httpbulbapediabulbagardennetwikipomegglitch
pokemon,not_removed,got attack on my crobat one time that was cool
pokemon,not_removed,attack on a snorlax on a sos chain of bagon
pokemon,not_removed,its from evs
pokemon,not_removed,i fished for that king of the sea or whatever and got a lv magikarp leveled that gyarados once after beating nothing but machoke and got somewhere in the teens xd or something i dunno really high
pokemon,not_removed,to in hp as blissey is yeah
pokemon,not_removed,you can get more than i just checked it if you have a bold or any def nature shuckle with defense ev at then give it defense evs and get it to you will get
pokemon,not_removed,almost as good as the current xyz ending theme where pikachu sings about ketchup
pokemon,not_removed,you get a lot of legendaries you can bank over
pokemon,not_removed,absolutely oras are on par sm in my my opinion the endgame content is surprisingly good and the main story itself while not challenging is very fun and enjoyable no character edits though which i had no issue with
pokemon,not_removed,this is very controversial but i enjoyed it more than sm legendaries so many legendaries if you care about competitive its worth mentioning that groudonkyogre and latioslatias also zangoose is better than seviper lunatone and solrock are about even shiftryludicolo and mawilemega is probably slightly better than sableyemega however latias is still very usable as is sableye the other differences are far more pronounced you might also want a mate with the other game so you can get giratina and kyurem its story is probably not as good as sm but its far easier to get your pokemon to in it and it has some moves that pokemon in sm cant learn as well as having far more of them
pokemon,not_removed,i got the same question i only got a on black friday so i went for moon i would like to hear the answer also
pokemon,not_removed,hell yes the amount of legendaries in it alone are stagering so if you are into competitive boom now u can get all of them and sr for nature and ivs if not the dex alone is a reason
pokemon,not_removed,if it changed lord it did its almost a throwback more than a remake but it is really fun to explore the lovely hoenn again also dem legendaries floating everywhere
pokemon,not_removed,it will expand the number of pokemon you can use so yes if you like pokemon you should totally get it unoobsatlarge
pokemon,not_removed,i bought alpha sapphire purely for nostalgia reasons i havent played the games since blackwhite and it was a beautifully constructed game
pokemon,not_removed,apart from all the legendaries there are also a lot of tutor moves that will be useful to transfer over via pokebank if you plan on playing competitively edit i really enjoyed the story as well
pokemon,not_removed,yes
pokemon,not_removed,the story and in my opinion the game is very mediocre compared to other pokemon entries and i loved the originals however there are a fantastic assortment of legendaries you can get
pokemon,not_removed,oras has a lot pokemon and the games are quite good
pokemon,not_removed,you wont be disappointed
pokemon,not_removed,so pretty much the big benefit is a lot of legendary pokemon post game
pokemon,not_removed,agreed the gameplay is very different and just as fun in its own way arranging everything you need to reach each legendary is a lot of fun leveling up your pokemon with blissey bases is fun to setup
pokemon,not_removed,i lost count after srs but it took me hours to get a sorta perfect latios it actually wasnt perfect ivs completely some of them were but hey close enough
pokemon,not_removed,and move tutors for gen pokemon and non alolan forms
pokemon,not_removed,i dont care about legendaries but there are a lot of pokémon i want to train that arent in sunmoon
pokemon,not_removed,also the legendaries can be shiny
pokemon,not_removed,new zealand dodrio its a large flightless wingless bird and heads to represent our three major islands although one island is smaller and nobody lives there so doduo could work too
pokemon,not_removed,so why did you choose these personally im interested in why belgium is manectric
pokemon,not_removed,oh sorry for the poor formatting
pokemon,not_removed,like many other countries belgiums national animal is a lion i couldnt think of any other lion pokémon other than pyroar and the legendary beasts so i googled lion pokemon under the sea of pyroar and suicune i saw manectric and even though it is mostly based of a dog i put it down anyway p
