pokemontrades,removed,what am i supposed to include its the event meloetta from mystery gift and i havent received it from the delivery person yet
pokemontrades,removed,from my understanding and interpretation of the subs rules what youre asking for is something like this i still have the meloetta from this most recent anniversary event that youreop referencing sitting with the package delivery person at the pokecenter i downloaded it when the event was live and can still soft reset to obtain any given nature for it am i still doing it wrong with that this is literally the first event ive ever tried to trade and im being sincere in my ignorance

pokemontrades,removed,how about you pm me and we trade like that
pokemontrades,removed,this is my story in when i was years old my friends at elementary school were crazy about pokémon as almost every kid in the world my parents never bought me a gameboy but my best friend had a gameboy pikachu edition and obviously pokémon yellow too at recess i used to watch him play and sometimes he would let me battle the gym leaders we were fans of the tv show so we would pretend we were ash trying to win the kanto league learning the mew glitch and catching mewtwo had to be the greatest feeling of sucess a year old of the late could have after christmas holidays when we returned to school sabritas a brand of potato chips in méxico i think in the us they are called lays released a marketing campaign for pokémon and every bag of chips had a pokémon tazo which is a small collectible disk with the image of a pokémon and its pokedex number around that same time yugioh cards were becoming a thing and we used to play with them too and although the cards were in japanese we invented the effects and played that way not having a gameboy stopped being a problem and now my recess was spent playing yugioh or trading pokémon tazos after eating more than a hundred bags of chips i had a pretty good collection of tazos i even had mew and mewtwo the jewels of my collection you may not know this but in latin america theres a couple of very popular videos about a preacher in chile who said that pokémon and nintendo were satanic while showing yugioh cards to the audience inventing them crazy diabolic names saying they were trying to summon the devil and things like that my grandma is very religious and at that time we were living with her and she saw one of those videos on the news so she threw my collections of pokémon tazos and yugioh cards to the garbage i was crushed but when my friends knew the next day they decided to help me so for the next weeks they bought dozens of bags of potato chips to help me recover my collection of pokemon tazos we couldnt recover even half of the collection even less the mew duo but it was amazing to know that my classmates were good friends it was like when ash gets turned to stone and all the pokémon cried and helped pikachu bring him to life haha im years old now and although i lost contact with my childhood friends from elementary school i have really fond memories of them this being one of them

pokemontrades,removed,rules prohibit trading while yes offeringaccepting a trade is each half the trade i understand this yet being labeled nft on rpokémontrades clearly is the opposite of offering displaying is not the same as advertising as you are making it seem a museum displays items such as prehistoric dinosaur bones they are not advertising the dinosaur bones for retail does this make sense
pokemontrades,removed,what information did i not provide i thought i put everything i needed to if i didnt please tell me
pokemontrades,removed,ohhh i didnt specify that i downloaded it myself my bad well i did indeed obtain it myself via code but the thread is closed now so that doesnt matter really i will keep this in mind in the future many thanks sirmaam
pokemontrades,removed,okay i understand this i will delete the arceus from my porybox then how would i make it so i can trade pokemons from other comunities i mean i have been negotiating with user jfsushi mod from pokemonplaza to do a trade he said he can provide wondercard will those events be tradablehere and if i made a post of the thread in pokemontrades to hold the negotiation and the trade would that work
pokemontrades,removed,lf ha yungoos ha formantis and ha rockruff ft ha geodude in heavy ball ha marenie in lure ball ha vulpix in love ball ha sandsrew in dive ball and ha gible in beast ball
pokemontrades,removed,not trying to argue but have conversation about the discrepancy also this museum being my sheet does not mention anywhere that with good offer things listed nft are for trade you cant just assume half would do that when that isnt the case here this is what happens when something is simply labeled nft nft on rpokemontrades is a lot more specific i will change but you must understand as well

pokemontrades,removed,wouldnt you agree thats its pretty hard to trade hacked or otherwise illegitimate pokémon when no trade has taken place
pokemontrades,removed,ignoring the fact that youre just assuming the offer was in fact for illegitimate ones no where in the rules does it actually say that so while you may not like that the subreddit makes no mention of it whatsoever

pokemontrades,removed,i used this guide to start
pokemontrades,removed,i have always played pokemon but never got into breeding and competitive got into it this generstion your first things to do are to unlock iv judge in pc and then get dittos that cover all stats and you are all set for breeding
pokemontrades,removed,if you do a direct trade you can trade events i think its just not gts or wonder trade i dont have a meloetta or genesect but good luck getting one
pokemontrades,removed,pokemon who are in a cherish ball from an event cannot be put on the gts or wonder traded but can be traded with others normally via wifi or local connection pokemon that are editedhacked in any way that deviates from the norm from that pokemon cannot be traded via wifi in any way ie catching a yveltal on route a lucario that knows dragon ascent but can still be traded over local connection i think this is what you were asking
pokemontrades,removed,your best bet is to either go to casualpokemontrades or pokemongiveaway to get a hackedcloned meleotta and genesect or just wait until november and december for the anniversary versions

pokemontrades,removed,i searched it up too which is why i had no doubts these rules
pokemontrades,removed,the moderator with the purple luxray sprite was definitely nicer i suggest that you ask him for moderating advice or whatever you specialize in you would definitely benefit as you seem like a cold heartless machine that isnt even human with your words for example please is the only polite word you used you didnt even finish by saying thank you

pokemontrades,removed,there are three differences build a pc will only take a part list that you have already complied yourself and advise you on it and change parts for you personally who doesnt seem to be super into pcs i read the comment about the and series it might be daunting to have to start out on your own until they will even help you the cabal on the other hand have a questionnaire where you fill out your requirements and they do all the work and give you the best priceperformance for what you asked build a pc is large anyone so can advise you even for example robertoxmed aha this can lead to peoples opinions and biases and even plain wrong decisions the cabal is small and while discussion is encouraged only approved mods who have shown themselves in the past to give good builds can actually give you the final reply to your questionnaire with the completed part list this leads to the most important part especially if you are into pcs or are concerned about priceperformance build a pc advice can be biased as already mentioned ex people sticking with nvidia because amd processors have a bad rep but then also advising people to avoid amd gpus because of this when they are actually very competitive the cabal dont have biases or opinions every piece of advice they give you can be queried by you or other builders and the person who gave the advice is required to reply to you with multiple reliable benchmarks and tests that prove why the part they included is more efficient or better suited to the requirements they gave you they take this very seriously if ever a member refutes a certified builders part and provides sufficient reliable evidence for it the mods will change all the sample builds and change future advice to reflect the correct benchmarks this means you never have to rely on what someone says when spending or you can rely on the hard evidence provided tldr you tell the cabal what you want they reply with a build that is up to date with the best price to performance ratio tailored to your specific needs with benchmarks on request to backup their recommended build

like to say that i know the subreddit and its rules inside and out — im active on the irc report if i see any broken rules really like interacting with other members such as the ddt have contest experience humpday and help the mods as much as i can whenever im needed such as creating bannersflairs which of course im happy to do whether i have a custom flair beside my name or not when it comes to respect from what i know i have a good image in the community or at least i hope i do even if its a bit of a joker i do do silly things sometimes but i know when thats appropriate and when its not—and if i do make a mistake im always willing to apologize if im having fun with some friends on the irc thats a different situation than communicating with the moderators about what they would want to have done to the subreddit on the side of pokemon i have experience in some ingame mechanics eg breeding and sv hatching i have a powersaves a physical y along with digital yas i have a basictointermediate knowledge of hackinglegitimacy tools as i was not present during the prexy trading era but am always on the lookout for hackedcloned pokemon and am in possession of some prexy pokemon from trading when it comes to the knowledge of tools needed i have the most experience in photoshop which i have used to create designs in the past such as httpsstredditcomrpokemontrades aaaaaaaa httpstwittercomrpokemontrades and i have experience in google spreadsheets oh boy so i can help people with any spreadsheet problems they may have im also able to work in python i made a silly water gun game once html and css this experience in programming languages should make learning any new languages at least a bit easier than it would have otherwise been if that is ever needed on the job i was also a guild leader in a fairly well known guild in maplestory we now and had to play a role in recruiting and communications do you have extra skills that could be valuable to the subreddit has anybody else on the subreddit ever made an mlg rpokemontrades montage i dont think so i have not only done that but ive it in other words i can make videos if for some reason we ever need video tutorials for the subreddit guides for anything or a super awesome movie trailer you know who to call other than that i feel that i have a good sense of design when it comes to what should go where what looks good with what and a general idea of how something should be laid out or designed so that it looks as good as it can i love working on the aesthetic portion of things and a subreddit would be no different than a poster or banner i also consider myself to be a people person which is very helpful in a communication and interactionheavy environment such as this one i love talking to other people and i feel as if im always able to communicate well and get my point across im also always willing to help and learn if it is needed—of course i can spew personality traits all day but i think that you mods know me well enough to judge my personality without me needing to write my life story what is one thing you would change on the subreddit if you had the power this isnt so much of a subreddit change per se but just something that i and other users as per the survey have noticed i feel that the mod interaction with users is not the same as when i first joined the subreddit there would be mods having fun and integrating themselves with the community here there and everywhere through the threads now there are some moderators that i only see when somebody is breaking a rule which of course theyre doing their jobs i would love to have a closer relationship between the users of the subreddit and the moderators although i understand that isnt something you can change in a single day versus a rule which you can modify with a few clicks of the keyboard do you strongly disagree with any of our rules whywhy not ive spent enough time on the subreddit that ive come to just love the rules for what they are and appreciate the decisions made behind each one there arent any rules that i would disagree with strongly or even moderately i would make little changes here and there for phrasing and clarity in regards to some rules but there are none that i would go far enough as to say that i disagree with them thanks for taking the time to read this application moderators whether its me or not i know you guys will make the best decision for the subreddit stay awesome

pokemontrades,removed,i have a meloetta
pokemontrades,removed,characteristics are within the allowed parameters of the game regardless of the legitimacy of the parent pokémon any eggs produced will be considered legitimate as long as all characteristics of the resulting pokémon are obtainable by normal gameplay this includes egg move combinations poké ball type hidden abilities and any other inherited traits why do we believe this no matter the parents legitimacy the egg was created by the same method as all other eggs as long as the child does not have any illegal characteristics it is indistinguishable from an egg made by legitimate parents using cloned foreign dittos for breeding is a common practice for most active breeders a pokémon is illegal if it cannot be obtained via any legal methods ie a pearl oaks letter shaymin a zygarde in a dream ball or a pikachu that knows transform literally what on earth are you trying to say i had read it before thanks for the condescension but reading it again i am honestly questioning what part of what i said came across as wrong to you in any remote way it is actually far easier to say that there is no issue with the egg moves because they are within the parameters of the game based on their existence as egg moves the real issue is not about the parameters of the game it is with what a select few assert should be the parameters of the game and i say this all having already done what youve asked over three comments ago
pokemontrades,removed,the argument was never about whether or not they should be traded the argument was started out of your condescending attitude towards me trying to make accommodations and pointing out the difference between illegal and not being currently available without hacking on the part of even just one person on earth playing the game the best middle ground i can find is making a note of it in the onhand tab since that is the only place in the template where i can actually make notes i did this when i made this comment and not once did i ever say that i was going to revise past offers instead of providing an actual fix furthermore the entire point is that the egg moves can be obtained without hacking and are available by normal gameplay regardless of whether it is now or in the future and yes pokemon with unreleased ball combos and hidden abilities prior to the bank update are for all intents and purposes legal because they can be obtained through normal gameplay even if not exactly at this exact moment in time that is the distincion i was making which you immediately called nonsense that misconstrues policy
pokemontrades,removed,what are you looking for in exchange for the sharman i dont really have many event mons tbh but i have some shinies and legends
pokemontrades,removed,hi there we have removed this post for now as it does not meet the requirements laid out in httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikirulessidefull remember that you need to provide the full details for valuable pokemon upfront when offering as required by please respond to this comment once you have made the necessary changes and i will review and reapprove thanks

pokemontrades,removed,may i ask why this isnt in the rules then rule is very broad and vague and has no mention of anything outside of trading hackedcloned pokemon after trading here on rsvexchange and on rcasualpokemontrades my sheet is comprised of what you see now i enjoy using these outlets to trade and have always tried to play by the rules but even being labeled nft seems to be against this unwritten rule i understand you dont want people pm trading so there is less scamming and that makes sense but you can even look back and see i told one person that i would not be trading any of those on the subreddit so again rule being very broad and vague and has no mention of this so users like me dont have these problems i like the way my sheet has been the past months and think it is silly to have to worry about a mod looking and deciding my sheet is nonofferable here because i have a section labeled nft on this subreddit i believe that should be clarified in some way also since i was typing this as you edited your post i dont understand how displaying my sheet is offering the entire sheet because unless i say everything on the sheet then im not obviouslyshould be obvious i dont mean that in a dickish manner of course also to the last bit ive never traded illegitimate pokemon on this subreddit i only state that in a theoretical way those pokemon have all the checks to be legitimate other than wc and what not so say i brought them from insert here you may not know just stating i feel as if this is a little nitpicky since they are even labeled if someone wants to risk getting scammed in pms or whatevernot sure how i would scam someone in this manner that should be on them after reading the rules if someone has a section on their sheet that doesnt label clones as nft on this subreddit then i can understand where you guys are coming from excuse my wall of text since im on mobile
pokemontrades,removed,natures on the tapus
pokemontrades,removed,ft tapus shiny palossand hi there we have removed this post for now as it does not meet the requirements laid out in httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikirulessidefull remember that you need to provide the full details for valuable pokemon upfront when offering as required by please respond to this comment once you have made the necessary changes and i will review and reapprove thanks
pokemontrades,removed,so now that you made it clear to me after all this discussion this should be in the rules otherwise its technically not breaking any rules so still i am not breaking any rules as i read them now when i have time since im not near a computer i will edit the sheet at some point but again im not breaking and rules of the sub nothing is being traded the rules need to state this

pokemontrades,removed,celebi for your charmander or na mew code aniv darkrai
pokemontrades,removed,id love the mew i have shiny xerneasyveltal also event zygarde
pokemontrades,removed,i think the sun team is trying to create a world without night whilst the moon team is creating a world without daytime they will probably capture the sun or the moon legendary using some kind of machine or maybe they create artificial pokemon like magearna
pokemontrades,removed,the first starter you choose because it is simply given to you at the start of the game i think that celebi because it was a wifi event and not a code therefore it is easier to get than darkrai or mew also jirachi isnt as valued as celebi to some people the hardest event to get currently in my opinion is the volcanion event as it can only be redeemed with a code from japan in game it would be volcarona since it evolves really late and is extremely hard to leave up because larvesta is really weak no but you can get it via the long range trainer glitch
pokemontrades,removed,
pokemontrades,removed,hey pc ohho and mewtwo interested

pokemontrades,removed,apologies if im assuming too much but i thought id drop some advice i am working on the same thing and took a look at your dex seeing how much you are missing am i correct in assuming that you only have one gen game if thats the case you are going to achieve your goal much more quickly if you pick up a copy from the other half of the generation more specifically if your flair is uptodate then the best dex match for you would be a copy a x if you catch everything in x and as you will have everything you need to complete the dex aside from mythicals anyway i tell you that because it will definitely be faster to catchbreedevolve a few hundred pokemon rather than arranging trades for that many hope that helps and good luck

pokemontrades,removed,you guys got way way more strict in the last months truth be told its less fun this way it feels oppressive youre finding issues in something like of topics and initial responses only a few of which are actually critical to whatever your goal might be enforcing rules because they are rules accomplishes very little for the record i didnt even know there was a hope diancie and if you want to list them all there is both a and an depending on napal both of which i have and am willing to trade i planned on asking the guy which one he wanted

pokemontrades,removed,youre asking for a competitively natured shiny but not offering one in return additionally youre flatout ignoring someone you made a previous deal with on this thread just pointing out what kind of trader you are
pokemontrades,removed,deal when will you be on
pokemontrades,removed,you dont need to offer a shiny but you should definitely offer something of decent value starters are very easily breedable and everyone will have hundreds of them my recommendation is to trade for other unique pokemons island guardians legendaries other mystic tier pokemon or a pokemon that is very difficult to get like ones via sos chaining in specific whether conditions mew is still worth more than any of these things ive listed youll be hard pressed to find someone willing to give it away unless you offer something at least half value

pokemontrades,removed,hi there how did you obtain these diancie when trading on this subreddit please be sure to include full details of how you obtained your valuable pokemon this is not only just the ot of the event but how you went about obtaining it or received it httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikirulessidefull which you will need to read in order to trade here please reply back with the details
pokemontrades,removed,do u have any gen pokemon u can trade i have all of what you are looking for
pokemontrades,removed,have you chosen an offer yet
pokemontrades,removed,do you possibly have a ditto
pokemontrades,removed,hello your post is missing the details required by rule please rpokemontradeswikirules in full and make the necessary changes by editing your post then reply directly to me so i can review it
pokemontrades,removed,barely scraper th surface but here is a video on pokemon trambuilding in the vgc format
pokemontrades,removed,as others have said the best sub to ask more about this would be rstunfisk as that is the sub for competitive pokemon that said if you are serious about breedingtraining your own pokemon for vgc events you should obtain the set of power items for ev training a destiny knot for passing more ivs to your pokemons offspring an everstone passing down nature and dittos that are obtainable through sos chaining all of the above items are available for bp if you are comfortable grinding the battle tree or could be traded for relatively easily on this sub if you have items that people want such as lucky eggs icemoondusk stones bottlecaps apricorn balls etc though you should only part with these items if you really dont care about them as many are onepergame or hard to reobtain later hope this helps
pokemontrades,removed,if you want to breed you own competitive pokemon applying for a ditto would be a good start it requires some community participation to apply and the service is paused right now you can chain for your own ditto on mount hokulani theres a few good guides online on how to do that if you dont know what pokemon you want if you need some breedject to start breeding with you can trade limited items from your own game to get a decent start apricorn balls master balls lucky eggs and battle point items are some things you might have leftover from your current game you could trade for these breedjects i assume youre getting into sm vgc and not oras since that ones basically over if not then im afraid i dont have any tips for oras vgc
pokemontrades,removed,keen how many caps for it

pokemontrades,removed,ot ash id shiny toucannon wild encounter catch
pokemontrades,removed,all caught by me sorry
pokemontrades,removed,id imagine they did mean to say hacked a lot of hacked pokemon are dished out in giveaways i wouldnt worry i wouldnt imagine anything will come of it youre not to know the validity of a pokemon you receive over a trade plus if bank let you move it around then its passed the validity check as far as i know the wave of bans that happened recently were people who had modified saved data i presume from using power saves or whatever
pokemontrades,removed,they were obtained through transfer using a series of glitches in the base game of pokemon red and blue you can manipulate the dv now iv when pokemon are transferred pokemon with a certain series of dv are made shiny no outside tools were used and all can be obtained in game if you would like more information i can pm you the details of the glitch if that is appropriate
pokemontrades,removed,i could but i feel like giving an exact tutorial of how to get the mons i am attempting to trade in the thread where i am trading is bad for business is using series of dropping items missingo i obtain a glitched item which lets me augment dv values by the items in my inventorymons in my party acceptible
pokemontrades,removed,for things like dittos i have seen others just write rng abuse can i ask them for an explanation of how specifically to get the dittos myself as well sorry for the back and forth i just dont think the exact specifics of the glitch should be required on every post in the future i will gladly disclose i have done it but dont want to have to copypaste a extremely lengthy tutorial on each time i offer or mandate someone has that same paragraph if they retrade them ever

pokemontrades,removed,your policy lists that disclosure of the items being hacked is necessary actually per the policy allowed without disclosure hackedcloned items additionally the legitimacy policy also gives reasoning for cloned items it is not so much that we endorse or support them in any way it is more a matter of simply being impossible to tell a cloned item from one legitimately obtained we simply understand that item cloning is very widespread and there is just nothing we can do about it as always you should provide full disclosure if an item you are looking to trade is cloned make sure to mark it as such so that if another user does not want to use cloned items they can avoid the trade

pokemontrades,removed,the modest xuriktree is hyper trained

pokemontrades,removed,i traded it to someone ot artemis diamond next to the name for an admant buzzwole user
pokemontrades,removed,nope but have any battle items to trade or a metal coat
pokemontrades,removed,maybe but i dont think so because i dont remember breeding a crabwraler for anyone
pokemontrades,removed,nothing in their
pokemontrades,removed,so i must have gotten it from that user
pokemontrades,removed,i cant find anything

pokemontrades,removed,i checked and didnt find anything
pokemontrades,removed,did you find anything
pokemontrades,removed,we u and the mods
pokemontrades,removed,what are the minior colors none of them are shown and i want to know before say if im interested i also want to know how you got more tabs but that is unrelated im mainly interested in level turtonator love alomomola heavy klink heavy magnemite friend sewaddle friend petilil and friend eevee i also realize that my might not have much that interests you for all of those so i hope that we can work some out at the very least
pokemontrades,removed,interested in your moon ball growlithe let me know if you want to trade
pokemontrades,removed,interested in moon oranguru and love ha pyukumuku for moon jangmoo and beast dhelmise
pokemontrades,removed,alright
pokemontrades,removed,hi im interested in your fast salandit let me know if you see anything in that you may be interested in
pokemontrades,removed,im interested in your fast eevee and heavy beldum tell me if anything catches your interest
pokemontrades,removed,is that really true i certainly didnt know either way this page is more for my own personal records than trading on here and reverting it for something that comes out in a couple weeks seems a bit convoluted and unnecessary im happy to follow the rules and not trade them out on here until after bank i only have the one cutiefly anyway but honestly i would rather not go through the hassle of making soontobeoutdated modifications that only make things more difficult for me this legality information is now clearly known in this thread and as soon as i submit this comment i will make a corrective note on the trading thread i opened earlier today in accordance with the rules of this sub your issue is after all with me offering those two pokemon rather than with me acknowledging that i have them i hope that you can be understanding
pokemontrades,removed,thank you i will learn from this mistake
pokemontrades,removed,hi im interested in friend magby love emolga my on hand list is
pokemontrades,removed,i have a torkoal in a fastball with fissure and ivs in speed interested
pokemontrades,removed,part of my concern is that going ahead and labeling them as illegal or not for trade then comes back to bite me in an event of me forgetting to chance them back the best middle ground i can find is making a note of it in the onhand tab since that is the only place in the template where i can actually make notes the only issue there if it is recognized as a real issue is that the note only can be attached to breedjects rather than breedables it isnt the best solution but the way i see it is as a working one is that acceptable
pokemontrades,removed,hi im interested in your blue heavy green friend violet moonminior these are the pokes i currently have on hand ha love goomy moon misdreavus heavy torkoal ha friend trapinch love ha vanillite heavy ha togedemaru friend ha phantump friend ha pancham love bounsweet

pokemontrades,removed,i wasnt negotiating i was telling you what i can and immediately did do to alleviate your concerns futhermore it is not an illegal pokemon at all technically speaking illegal are those generally considered to have innate qualities brought about by hacking specifically those that cannot be changed therefore illegal pokemon are those with ivs and shininess that are hacked neither of which can be changed is in a ball that it cannot be caught in also something that cannot be changed or has a move or ability that it would not be able to normally have under any other circumstances an egg move that a pokemon actually get legitimately and can be passed legitimately from a parent is not illegal currently not actually obtainable without someone somewhere hacking yes illegal no arguing that it is illegal because of a parent obtained via illegal means then bans all pokemon bred with a ditto which means that a large potion of this sub needs to be shut down immediately sorry to get off on that tangent but details matter to me now that the discussion has gotten sufficiently off track i would like to reiterate that i did not know either was not currently available and that i am doing what i reasonably can do to address and alleviate your concerns thank you

pokemontrades,removed,im looking for a mew looking for anything specific a shiny slowbro or mewtwo maybe
pokemontrades,removed,okay ive done some cleaning up of things i think in the future im going to separate out all the stuff thats not for trade and just keep the documentation somewhere else the few pokemon that dont have links next to them now all have something in the notes section that says where they came from i really need to redo all my spreadsheetsrecordkeeping for gen vii anyway just to know would it be acceptable to state in a trade post that everything came from rsvexchange and then include otstids without actually including hatch links in posts but then providing links as people express interest a strict reading of the rules seems to suggest thats okay but mods seem to dislike statements about things being available on request i only ask because its easy for me to create a table from keysave that i know has accurate ottid information but with a shiny collection thats getting into the hundreds thats a lot of individual links to include manually

pokemontrades,removed,yes i would how do we do this im still new to reddit
pokemontrades,removed,i appreciate the sentiment regardless
pokemontrades,removed,i transfered them from my copies of gen they are my legends originally
pokemontrades,removed,yep i get it hence i why i said i was simply asking if interested not directly offering anything its literally a yes or no question and i honestly dont see the big deal i am interested what do you have or i may be interested depending on the offer which i would then take the time to explain and follow rule or im not interested and i would say thanks anyway and leave like im sorry i didnt do it and that im arguing about it i understand its important here to do these things because trust is very important when dealing with legit shinyeventetc pokémon im just saying i wasnt making an offer yet i just wanted to know if op was even interested before making an offer i literally said that i could offer if rule states that full details must be provided when offering my pokémon upfront then maybe you shouldnt hassle me about it when i hadnt actually offered anything yet but again sorry for arguing we may just see things differently here and regardless i wont be making the mistake again i just think in this particular situation my comment was misunderstood i would appreciate a response because if im wrong i would like to know and adjust my opinion i dont want to be that stubborn guy that never changes cause he thinks hes right all the time
pokemontrades,removed,like what
pokemontrades,removed,i have one code left and a few genesect
pokemontrades,removed,i understand that im at work and i cannot access my ds at this moment you will have to either give me some time to get the information or take the post down i didnt know that when i had commented and i cannot access that information until my sihft ends and i go home at est thank you
pokemontrades,removed,i did obtain it myself but i looked into it and it turns out that its illegitimtely shiny which boggles my mind because i have no idea how it got that way and ive got no idea how to hack pokemon theres potential that my brother couldve hacked it shiny when he had possession of my copy of y

pokemontrades,removed,i have shiny starmie shiny mudbray evolution forgot name shiny fearow shiny lycanroc and my tape koko is bold nature
pokemontrades,removed,i edited post to show what i can offer
pokemontrades,removed,i agree there are many methods we use to obtain pokemon that are not the way the game is intended to be played using party tools to view hidden data and use that to ones advantage is a form of cheating in my opinion the same goes for shiny value abuse emulators etc these are all controversial topics in the online pokemon trading community however we allow these because the data in the game is not edited this is the thin line between what some people consider cheating and outright hacking in rpokemontrades the aforementioned controversial tools are so normalized that even respectfully disagreeing with them can result in unfair backlash we even had a bit of it here until raia removed them however you shouldnt let this bother you in our recent that it is tolerable over have taken the bolder claim that it should be outright disallowed so your opinion is definitely not an uncommon one
pokemontrades,removed,im willing to trade if you are i have a munchlax and i am interesred in your darkrai
pokemontrades,removed,do you want a shiny ditto with a bottlecap for the bagon

pokemontrades,removed,nature and ivs on the cosmog
pokemontrades,removed,why did you delete this thread
pokemontrades,removed,that is correctto my knowledge they were all just cloned for other peoples use i did get items traded on them idk if that means they were hacked but i assumed not since the item and poke have nothing to do with each othervulpix is from and absol is from
pokemontrades,removed,sorry so just to clarify youre after the munchlax from the snorlaxium z event correct
pokemontrades,removed,what events would you offer for adamantcareful level celesteela hyper trained
pokemontrades,removed,the details for those are in the porybox should i state them in the comments i make that reference the pokemon in the porybox as well
pokemontrades,removed,the following is not a personal attack i am genuine in my inquiry if you disagree with the egg rng method that is completely legitimate ingame how do you justify using completely hacked ditto to breed with ufoxlery ugazier only users are able to be tagged at a time anyone is welcome to reply in civil discussion since youre playing the way the game was intended and are putting in the time to get the nice thing rngabuse removes the challenge of getting something rare and ultimately devalues it wouldnt the same apply to using hacked parents for ivs egg moves and pokeball items too you cant be removing the challenge as there is none its simply time and probability that is removed there is no more effort exerted with rng you actually are working toward a goal a definite goal where youre effort is maximized and rewarded with exactly what you expect there are many methods we use to obtain pokemon that are not the way the game is intended to be played using party tools to view hidden data and use that to ones advantage is a form of cheating in my opinion the same goes for shiny value abuse emulators etc these are all controversial topics in the online pokemon trading community what is the way that the game was intended to be played the vast majority of information about ingame mechanics has been a result of user testing in part using third party tools to determine exactly how the game works once the information is disseminated it is spread among the community atlarge for the betterment of all there is a lot that is left up to users to do it seems intentional as it has been this way since pokemons inception even their own official guidebooks have had inaccurate information that has later been corrected by fans i concede that the surprise factor is ruined but how surprised could you be youre aware of what you put into the nursery and what you would like the outcome to be youre aware of the probability outcomes a true surprise would be putting a blastoise and venusaur in the nursery and getting a charmander cheating would be editing the pokemon itself the message of pokemon and the application are polar opposites for ingame simply powering through grinding and using items is fine as many of us know for optimal performance in battles however there are few requisites at minimum these are natures stats and abilities all of which are random resources and guides exist to remove the artificial timesink in the same way that rng does if you use a guide then youre doing the same thing and replacing possible outcomes with definite outcomes which should give more of a sense of accomplishment and keep players playing for longer as they have a vested interest with the above idea in mind wouldnt every pokemon that is an offspring of one of the hacked ditto be httplegaldictionarythefreedictionarycomfruitfromaforbiddentree even if its undetectable drawing the line at editing everything up to the parents having legal data so that the offspring is legitimate seems to be the only thing that can be done as a hard line and that has been done i collect only shinies caughthatched by myself since theres no way to trust a shiny from another user all trading is based on trust and faith someone could hack a shiny just as easily as an unshiny to make an arbitrary distinction seems ignorant to allow for personal exclusions in the sake of time appears hypocritical especially in the face of a completely legitimate method however that is the most common excuse that ive heard for using a hacked ditto to breed with i even used it above to make a point i also say this as someone that has built up breeding stock legitimately in gen i then and still do hack pokemon to breed with and i have shared both legitimate and legally hacked pokemon where they are allowed respectively as a mod of rbreedingdittos and a seasoned giveaway host i recognize many users that have either directly or indirectly benefited it seems to be an open secret that many breedable trades involve hacked lineage this community has built the trade economy upon its foundation and whenever its acknowledged there are tremors id go even further and say that using egg rng is more legitimate than breeding with a hacked ditto or any other variation of hacked parents theres a much greater claim to integrity with it and as stated above akin to following any other usersubmitted guide rng in pokemon games is not new only newly returned this method of rng is very accessible and in my opinion the best that one could get for breeding in game to be better and it would have been more initially accepted if it included information for wildencounters including gift pokemonlegendstapusub theres no timer needed you dont need a special ottidsid combo you dont have to change the date of your game and turn it on at a specific time to hit a seed all that you do is breed ingame as normal and save yourself the headache and disappointment of boxes of eggs bred in a lottery whats more is youll have exactly what youre looking for and in the process have a stock of eggs that you can trade to others many of which may be competitive and you could potentially match someone on rsvexchange that could either hatch it shiny for you to add to your trading stock or you could gift it to make someone else happy of course everyone is entitled to play the way that they feel best when others are involved however full disclosure should always be given it goes without saying that the rules should always be followed they are the true foundation and are fortified if ever there is a buckle it does not crumble because of shared ideals and a friendly atmosphere this is a game chill
pokemontrades,removed,i understand that ucrownofnails i introduced ditto into the conversation i was not seeking to argue simply understand i recognized one users name in particular and made the connection based on their response to the op and the apparent hypocrisy with their stance ditto was only one part of my post and was used to illustrate the merits of the new method in contrast if i should remove the mention from my post i can but i believe that the full message of my post illustrates my point and would invite civil discourse with the intent of understanding differing viewpoints and clearing misconceptions

pokemontrades,removed,replying to you as well i apologize for not seeing the change in mods earlier both you and will have this same message okay so heres the current situation ive returned home and the i cant find the original physical card the last time i saw any of them was on the end table to my sofa and they were scattered about my roommate must have thrown them away seeing as they were on that table and i admit it must have looked like trash the only ones i have left are my untouched volcanion ones upstairs in my room and a used arceus card that fell under the sofa that i found one i personally used myself therefore there is nothing else i can do about this situation except still keep my return offer and bite the bullettake the loss on this trade however there is more to this situation so hang in there i usually get these legendary card batches in groups of to the very same store gave me another code which i later tried to use in a giveaway about two ish weeks ago that card was also invalid and after trying it myself it was clear that the code was jacked up and i closed the giveaway i wish i had the card to prove it but i do think that both cards were invalid especially since i received them from the same gamestop proof of that post is here and here is an image of a message received along with a follow up by me httpimgurcomndnjdyp this correlation never became clear to me until thinking about it now also here is a spreadsheet that i use as a tracker for all the legendary event codes that ive been collecting note it is short however ive only gotten back into pokemon very recently this statement will also be reflected in my comment history seeing as i took a two year break and decided to make a tracker after seeing it utilized all over this subreddit for obvious reasons note the two trades that havent been necessarily closed are the two arceus codes that ive apparently have had issues with especially the one code that is the root of this entire problem spreadsheet httpimgurcomgpyvdwx finally and for what its worth or even if you two care here is proof that i actually in fact not a cheater since one out of the whole two trades ive been involved with since ive began playing again was successful one being this issue look i know how to properly send codes lol if you need further proof past this you can look in my comment history to see that i even turn my nose most of the time to svexchange pokemon therefore why would i try and scam someone out of a code lol once again im not against the person filing this claim i dont have a problem with them directly just the way this was handled and being called a cheater because he couldnt get what he wanted right then and right there i offered solutions from the get go and continue to do so now please update me asap on the standing of this issue although its your decision as a mod and this issue might not be solved just yet i personally dont see what more i can do or how i can still be in trouble for this after this post after all im the one whos willing on taking the loss here i also apologize for anything that you have perceived to be negative towards yourself that was not any intention of mine thank you again and im sorry this had to involve you at least you didnt have this rain on your parade and somewhat ruin your mood for one of your best friends weddings im being lighthearted about this joke even though its true just so you know

pokemontrades,removed,yes not for the point of hating but pointing out why i thought he was suspicious which is why i asked if he was really a new user or just a new account and stopped replying after that bc i had no proof and it was just suspicion so why are you even butting in its not like i just accused the dude outright just voiced out that i thought he was suspcious without just saying hey i think youre suspicious and actually said why i thought that which you mightve took the wrong way or you just like sticking your nose in other peoples business and user pethew is out of the question here i was talking about user squirtlesquod and i didnt even know that they were the same person and i dont care about why pethew was banned and im not hating on him but yeah while he might regret trading clones going back to the sub pretending to be someone else is wrong imo but i am not going to go there because that is besides the point so what are you even trying to say so if youre still going to stick with acting all high and mighty just bc you have flair and not listen to reason even after this then i cant do anything about that oh and a person can participate in a community without trading fyi

pokemontrades,removed,new info from serebii on hyper training seems to suggest it is mostly based on increasing single stat at a time with possibly rarer caps affecting multiple stats at a time probably its still good idea to at least aim to sr as many iv stats as possible but id think twice if its worth resetting in case just one stat is missing

pokemontrades,removed,hey im interested in your hoopa and diance i have a few event mons sitting around in bank not everything i have is transferred up yet but here is what ive got on hand at the moment celebi gamestp deoxys alamos darkrai tru shaymin tru arceus somewhere in my other games off the top of my head i know i have a tru regigas and a michnia arceus spelling on that ot might be off
pokemontrades,removed,i obtained them all so long ago im not really sure how i would go about getting proof of their authenticity thanks for the heads up
pokemontrades,removed,thank you unfortunately i dont have the cards these were all traded to me far in the past as far as proving myself to be trustworthy goes im afraid this is my first foray into this subreddit because ive just now given myself the mindset to go for a living dex for sunmoon ive got no reputation here so it would just be on my word
pokemontrades,removed,i have some legends up for trade pm me if you are interested
pokemontrades,removed,thank you and dont sweat it i didnt realize what the pokemon trading community had really become now that hacking and cloning is rampant i havent tried to trade anything online since those event mons i posted the only things i have that i suppose are proofed are the bank celebi maybe victini and a manaphy from earlier this year i doubt any of which youd be interested in but thanks anyways good to know i at least own some desirable trades even if they are proofless i might try and shore up the proof but honestly it would probably require a herculean effort good luck with your trading
pokemontrades,removed,do you consider gulpin as common
pokemontrades,removed,
pokemontrades,removed,what are you offering
pokemontrades,removed,what do you have for trade i have on hand currently
pokemontrades,removed,i have a few that i can offer
pokemontrades,removed,s breaking news pokemon sun and moon iv hyper training has been explained better this is what serebii says pokémon sun moon earlier this week the youtube channel for the japanese magazine vjump put up a video detailing ivs in pokémon in this video it gave a bit of clarification into the process in the video it showed three different garchomp with different iv spreads and each of them used a silver bottle cap at hyper training this allowed for one stat to be increased in this case the attack was increased on all three garchomp this means that youll be able to use the silver bottle cap in exchange to increase one stat only it was also mentioned that there may be a gold bottle cap and questioned if it will be used to increase multiple stats to their maximum it is still not known how the bottle caps can be obtained and if theres a limit to the amount you can find well bring more on hyper training and sun moon as it comes some of the photos httpwwwserebiinetgarchomphtjpg shall i post the news or something

pokemontrades,removed,i am signing out for today but expect to continue this discussion tomorrow as i strongly believe that i should be completely allowed to trade celebi in which was originally received in a completely legitimate way the proof that i have given you should prove by far sufficient based on your rules standards so i will not stop until you or one of the more sensible moderators allows me to freely participate in this subreddit community have a good night i hope you reconsider your decision to try to stop me in trading my celebi

pokemontrades,removed,have a hope diancie what would you want for the rotom
pokemontrades,removed,youre not allowed to trade for pokemon that cant be legally obtained in gen on this subreddit until the bank update comes out
pokemontrades,removed,good question technically the only reason theyd ever be legal at all is because of pokebank which is external from the game itself until a mod comes in i cant say for sure but the fact that it could be used for breeding more and putting them up on the gts before legit ones can be bank transferred or encouraging more hacking in general makes me think the answer would be no someone suggested rpokemongiveaway another option is rpokemonplaza
pokemontrades,removed,ill take the heavy ball magnemite

pokemontrades,removed,okay so heres the current situation ive returned home and the i cant find the original physical card the last time i saw any of them was on the end table to my sofa and they were scattered about my roommate must have thrown them away seeing as they were on that table and i admit it must have looked like trash the only ones i have left are my untouched volcanion ones upstairs in my room and a used arceus card that fell under the sofa that i found one i personally used myself therefore there is nothing else i can do about this situation except still keep my return offer and bite the bullettake the loss on this trade however there is more to this situation so hang in there i usually get these legendary card batches in groups of to the very same store gave me another code which i later tried to use in a giveaway about two ish weeks ago that card was also invalid and after trying it myself it was clear that the code was jacked up and i closed the giveaway i wish i had the card to prove it but i do think that both cards were invalid especially since i received them from the same gamestop proof of that post is here and here is an image of a message received along with a follow up by me httpimgurcomndnjdyp this correlation never became clear to me until thinking about it now also here is a spreadsheet that i use as a tracker for all the legendary event codes that ive been collecting note it is short however ive only gotten back into pokemon very recently this statement will also be reflected in my comment history seeing as i took a two year break and decided to make a tracker after seeing it utilized all over this subreddit for obvious reasons note the two trades that havent been necessarily closed are the two arceus codes that ive apparently have had issues with especially the one code that is the root of this entire problem spreadsheet httpimgurcomgpyvdwx finally and for what its worth or even if you two care here is proof that i actually in fact not a cheater since one out of the whole two trades ive been involved with since ive began playing again was successful one being this issue look i know how to properly send codes lol if you need further proof past this you can look in my comment history to see that i even turn my nose most of the time to svexchange pokemon therefore why would i try and scam someone out of a code lol once again im not against the person filing this claim i dont have a problem with them directly just the way this was handled and being called a cheater because he coulndt get what he wanted right then and right there i offered solutions from the get go and continue to do so now please update me asap on the standing of this issue although its your decision as a mod and this issue might not be solved just yet i personally dont see what more i can do or how i can still be in trouble for this after this post after all im the one whos willing on taking the loss here i also apologize for anything that you have perceived to be negative towards yourself that was not any intention of mine thank you again and im sorry this had to involve you at least you didnt have this rain on your parade and somewhat ruin your mood for one of your best friends weddings im being lighthearted about this joke even though its true just so you know

pokemontrades,removed,fyi its against the rules in this sub to do trades through pm since they cant be verified which is important for people who want flair showing theyve been trustworthy traders id like the coin for a dawn stone but someone else got here first

pokemontrades,removed,ok im sorry ill offer another mon
pokemontrades,removed,i have a shiny impish mareanie with ha and haze ot tyrantium id if youd be interested in that
pokemontrades,removed,updated it
pokemontrades,removed,if i remember correctly it was self bred by whoever traded it to me as for if it was cloned or hacked im fairly certain its legit
pokemontrades,removed,no problem out of curiosity is there really any way to be sure of a pokemons legitimacy i mean other than personally knowing its source
pokemontrades,removed,would you trade my shiny alola raticate for your mild tapu koko only if its not nicknamed or foreign though raticate is lvl caught at poni gauntlet by me in a pokeball naughty with hustle
pokemontrades,removed,i think i have a shiny spearow that i dont really care about if you still need one of those
pokemontrades,removed,youre kidding right everyone else can just say that they have something and its fine but the guy with the shiny spearow has to explain himself thats pretty funny spearow m keen eye quiet unknown ivs peck growl leer pursuit celestial ultra ball level eng the spearow was traded to me from rpokemoonsun found it was found on december on route is that enough information for you
pokemontrades,removed,im pretty positive that it isnt cloned or hacked spearow isnt exactly a pokémon thats in high demand for shiny season
pokemontrades,removed,no clue im assuming through another trade i cant really tell you exactly how the user obtained the shiny as i dont go searching through other users comment histories to find exact details of trades nor do i look for trade threads that would involve said user obtaining a shiny the only details i know is that i obtained it via that trade shown in the link i provided if its that big of a deal i have a legitimate shiny mankey that i caught myself that i can offer to the op this is a crap ton of hassle for a very minor issue
pokemontrades,removed,it may seem like a minor issue to you but we take legitimacy very seriously here if you find the moderation here to be too strict there are other trading subreddits that you are free to use which are far more lenient about legitimacy if you do continue to use rpokemontrades please take some time to ready our full rules okay ill bite my tongue thank you for the tip glad we could clear up this situation

pokemontrades,not_removed,hey everyone running a friendly competition for bug teams only with pgl format participants required to run and we are already at click the button below to signup prizes genesect gold bottlecap sport ball scyther bottle cap heavy ball caterpie big nugget
pokemontrades,not_removed,vc mew is expired just tried redeeming one for someone
pokemontrades,not_removed,im realizing that the issue with having so many breeding projects is i keep getting distracted from one to another im trying to focus on my shiny rhyhorn but i keep wanting to start my bb minior project short attention spans ftw
pokemontrades,not_removed,is it possible to get beast balls after the ub mission has been completed just wanna know so i can hoard abit more for use other than ubs after finishing the ub mission
pokemontrades,not_removed,does anyone know the max on poke beans in pelago it looks like is the max on the regular and that number is so random
pokemontrades,not_removed,qotd seeing as theres been a fair number of punny song thread titles if you were to use a song as a thread title pun what would it be can be for any thread tag
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi friends anyone wanna hit me up with competitive ideas for both lycanrocs i love them both aesthetically and want a few opinions before grinding out the shinies im pretty indecisive at least with abilitiesnature as their movepools are kinda meh for my taste at least
pokemontrades,not_removed,does anyone have any links to calculate stats with items i want to figure out the ev distribution and some items influence damage speed sp defense etc ive been searching for some stat calculators but most of them dont have setting for items
pokemontrades,not_removed,has the heavy ball code been released yet still not seeing it anywhere on my global link account
pokemontrades,not_removed,why do people sometimes mark there post as nsfw is that a way of saying its no longer active
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey when trading events do prefect ivs really make a massive difference is it worth doing a significantly bigger rate for rngs
pokemontrades,not_removed,do you have a shiny gabumon though
pokemontrades,not_removed,i believe that the looker hangs around after you complete the ub quest hell give you beast balls one at a time so long as you dont have any in your inventory so you have to give them to pokemon to hold so that he doesnt notice
pokemontrades,not_removed,my answer copied from the last time someone asked this i remember reading that the max for plain beans was the max for patterned beans was and the max for rainbow beans was the reason is that apparently the maximum number of any bean you can hold is and there are kinds of plain beans kinds of patterened beans and only kind of rainbow bean thus x equals plain beans x equals patterned beans and x equals rainbow beans
pokemontrades,not_removed,wish we could turn back time to the good old days when jigglypuff sang us to sleep when we were stressed out
pokemontrades,not_removed,i use midday as a rocks lead though u use it for a sd rock prooriity moveforget the name with a life orb
pokemontrades,not_removed,midday is pretty good under sandstorm as for midnight i like it too but its basically useless in comp it gets a lot less speed than midday for more bulk but it is a rock type so it cant really be a bulk mon
pokemontrades,not_removed,it does not its also locked to jolly and male so unless youre rnging it or want to sr its ivs anyway theres no point to sring it at all
pokemontrades,not_removed,try the pokémon showdown calculator
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes
pokemontrades,not_removed,in our subreddit css the nsfw tag has been repursed to mark threads as completed
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes
pokemontrades,not_removed,lol wow breeding wiseif you run out you could probably grab some from the gts
pokemontrades,not_removed,aaaaaahhh that makes sense thank you
pokemontrades,not_removed,that scarf no guard stone edge is nice tho
pokemontrades,not_removed,spa golduck hydro vortex bp vs hp spd assault vest lycanrocmidnight in rain through light screen or aurora veil guaranteed much investment such not worth it wow
pokemontrades,not_removed,is it also possible to determine the evs of a pokemon by looking at their stats at lvl with the given ivs and nature
pokemontrades,not_removed,would you happen to have the link thingy to gl for the code edit nm i found it lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you
pokemontrades,not_removed,right given their catch rate thats honestly probably easier
pokemontrades,not_removed,such a good calc i know who is going on my next team not
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i threw bb at mudbray and decided that wasnt a good idea
pokemontrades,not_removed,i meant if i knew the actual raw stats with the nature and ivs if its possible to figure out the evs
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah you can do that manually and not superquick go to pokemon showdown teambuilder create a new team select the pokemon put in level ivs nature then look at the stats on the right keep adding evs until the stats on the right match the actual stats of your pokemon now you roughly know the ev distribution of that pokemon
pokemontrades,not_removed,you could try this httpwwwserebiinetgamesivcalcsmshtml first input pokemon species nature level and raw stats in the left black column then enter the ivs in the right green column click calculate eps on the bottom of the right column and you should get the evs on the left column below the boxes for ivs evs i hope this helps

pokemontrades,not_removed,kk adding you now
pokemontrades,not_removed,i already have all starters so is there anything else you can offer
pokemontrades,not_removed,i can hatch you a chespin froakie and a squirtle do you have anything other than fire starters you could trade i dont care about ivs or rare pokémon or anything i just dont like using more than one starter per team if not dont sweat it id be happy to hatch them for you anyways
pokemontrades,not_removed,i can offer some ha pokémon if youre in to that or if you need any others for your dex i can see what i can do
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have some ha pokémon if you like those plus some other normal pokémon i can happily catch or find anything youre looking for i have a plethora of friend safaris if you need a certain one from there
pokemontrades,not_removed,thats a link to all the ha pokémon i have as of right now if you need a different one ill see what i can do
pokemontrades,not_removed,hm do you have any male shinx theyre my favorite pokémon
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes or i can at least xd i just need to breed one since i only have luxio right now
pokemontrades,not_removed,actually if you have sun is love love love to have a shinx there ill love one in x too though so either one will be great
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have your pokémon when youre ready
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont have sun unfortunately but i can definitely get you one in x i managed to hatch all of my first eggs female which id usually celebrate but not this time xd ill see if the second batch works any better and in the meantime i will add your friend code
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah sorry i slept in way too much ill add you now and whenever youre ready i can trade and if you only have female shinx ill take one i prefer males but im not super picky on gender could you possibly nickname them thor if theyre male and thora if theyre female if thats too much work dont worry about it
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah of course id be more than happy to such cute names too we just got back home and i have a little bit of work to do before i can trade but i will start working on names asap
pokemontrades,not_removed,thats great thank you im actually out to lunch right now so take your time on the work oh also i think i can get you a treeko
pokemontrades,not_removed,great would you like an assortment of shinxs so of them for your starters or would you like another pokemon as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,nope just one shinx hm you did say fire starters so do you have a cyndaquil theyre also one of my faves if not then just the shinx will be fine
pokemontrades,not_removed,i do have a cyndaquil any specific gender youre looking for also im on my egg and still no male xd i dont know whats wrong with my egg hatching skills haha
pokemontrades,not_removed,i definitely prefer male cyndaquils but given the female streak thats happening here ill take whatevers conveniant 😂 female shinx works out actually i have a bit of male heavy team so thora is fine its grown on me actually
pokemontrades,not_removed,great if needbe i can just send over thor and thora if thor ever hatches tt as for the cyndaquils i have a box prehatched and the female ratio means a male is almost certain to be one of them i will continue to hatch the shinxes until you get back from lunch d
pokemontrades,not_removed,finally i hatched a male one 😂😂
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey sorry that took a while i got really sick after lunch guess i ate too much 😬 i cant control myself around italian food xd im ready to send over the first three whenever ill need to throw my sceptile in the nursary with a ditto in oras i can get you that one after the first set or i can go ahead and hatch him and transfer to x for one big trade whichever you prefer
pokemontrades,not_removed,we can just transfer them to x and have one big trade so how many shinxes and how many cyndaquils are you looking for im not sure how many starters you will be sending
pokemontrades,not_removed,just one of each is great thanks itll be starters all in all sorry about the delay i had to find a ditto
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay i can give you a male and female of each then since were trading four times and id only be giving two pokemon you actually want
pokemontrades,not_removed,victory i forgot how long treekostook to hatch im ready whenever oh and you dont need to send a female cyndaquil i know those are hard to hatch and i really only need one so you should keep it i like helping people out so its really no biggie if you just send a caterpie or something
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello there i have what youre looking for

pokemontrades,not_removed,np glad we got that sorted out
pokemontrades,not_removed,added and getting online
pokemontrades,not_removed,
pokemontrades,not_removed,let me know if that was the right one im sure that its the right one
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes it is thanks for the trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,np thanks for the trade as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have a jpn ditto looking for dbha females with ems and stuff finding foreign dittos is annoying but i seem to have a knack for the japanese ones
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey if you cant find someone to trade with i suggest rbreedingdittos they have giveaways every now and then and you request one with a lang tag thats different from yours
pokemontrades,not_removed,i wasnt aware the that masuda method required that the name has to be in the foreign language as well what happens if its nicknamed using the american alphabet where did you hear about the name part
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have jpn ditto with a jpn nickname nature is docile im not after anything specific but something with a ha or good ivs will be alright
pokemontrades,not_removed,what nature is it
pokemontrades,not_removed,american alphabet xd the name is irrelevant the tag and origin is what affects the masuda method i have tried it
pokemontrades,not_removed,quirky
pokemontrades,not_removed,the article you linked has no mention of requiring that the name of the pokemon be in the foreign language it says that theres a internal marker that shows which language the pokemon was created in i havent heard of the method requiring that a japanese pokemon must be named in a certain way for it to work do you remember where you heard this part
pokemontrades,not_removed,do you have any mon in mind i dont have bw but i probably have ha eg and
pokemontrades,not_removed,i knew the method and someone told me it had to have a certain name sorry maybe they were wrong
pokemontrades,not_removed,do not ignore a moderator i am expecting a reponse do not post anywhere else on the subreddit until then
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello sorry but this thread has been removed please do not post trade threads more frequently than once per hours in the future please consider creating a single thread tradinglooking for multiple things instead of creating multiple threads please read our httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikirules before posting
pokemontrades,not_removed,taken thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,i could try and breed you one to have in y for a ha snivvy
pokemontrades,not_removed,im working on a fire hp sylveon but trying to get a female with its ha so ill probably get a few male ones that i dont want ill let you know when i get it it might take awhile because i only do batches a day breeding is too boring for me
pokemontrades,not_removed,do you need ha on the dive ball eevee
pokemontrades,not_removed,i kinda need it now though and eevee takes a while to breed id breed it myself if i did have time i have multiple female ha snivy i wouldnt mind parting with though if you have something to offer for it
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you for the offer but i need to borrow a female i have a hp fire ditto id breed it myself but i need perfect eggs by tuesday
pokemontrades,not_removed,not if its for umbreon
pokemontrades,not_removed,well letsee i just started to reaim for a living dex after taking the months after the bank came out off so i have plenty of spares of things to part with but i havent started my breeding run on anything other than my charmandersbulbasquirttles so the rest probably dont have great ivs or egg moves if youre looking for that i also have a shiny woobat that i have no interest in but figure it makes good trade fodder for those that like green woobats as well as a shiny friend safari ditto that doesnt have its ha and only has hp and atk as its ivs
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay i have one for you with curse and wish
pokemontrades,not_removed,someone is giving me a eevee so you can just have a female snivy

pokemontrades,not_removed,they are from my hometown lancaster ca i dont really know exactly how they obtained it all i know is what my friend told me the event was four years ago so i doubt he still has the card with the code on it next time i see him i will see if he still has the wondercard on his black and white
pokemontrades,not_removed,they are from my hometown lancaster ca i dont really know exactly how they obtained it all i know is what my friend told me what exactly did they tell you
pokemontrades,not_removed,he told me that the meloetta is from the event from when that movie came out he said he went to the pokemon center store in tokyo bought the movie and that the worker handed him the card with the code on it
pokemontrades,not_removed,he told me that the meloetta is from the event from when that movie came out he said he went to the pokemon center store in tokyo bought the movie and that the worker handed him the card with the code on it are you absolutely certain that this is true and that the meloetta is completely legitimate not hacked or cloned
pokemontrades,not_removed,knowing my friend i can say with confidence that it is completely legitimate but i understand that may not mean squat to you so its your call on whether or not i can have it up for trade on here
pokemontrades,not_removed,again are you certain that what they told you about its origins is true as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes i am certain
pokemontrades,not_removed,then would you like to explain how that could be the case when the meloetta was not distributed using a code
pokemontrades,not_removed,i cant explain that haha like i said i only know what he told me if he lied to me then so be it

pokemontrades,not_removed,i have no more breedjects to offer atm thank you for the trades
pokemontrades,not_removed,should be power of alchemy
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you as well keep in contact if you come across others or if i can help
pokemontrades,not_removed,it is thanks for the great deals enjoy your new mons
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have a ton of pokemon many in apricot balls that i havent bread yet ill contact you once i have some more breedjects
pokemontrades,not_removed,to you as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,just wanna make sure i understand your redeem rate right if i want single nature redeem that costs shinies natures natures natures natures free plus a code of some sort that isnt a
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello i tried to read your breeding service sheet im not sure if i understand what you mean if i want a perfect female with egg moves what will it cost me if i want a shiny perfect pokemon with ems what will it cost me hoping for an answer asap as im currently need someone who have time to breed
pokemontrades,not_removed,as mentioned i have an egg that matches your tsv female dbhainfiltraotor adamamt spiritomb please reply here so it can be documented under flairhq and abide all rules i dont care what you give me in return and to answer your recent question yes i am still available uantoniocesarm
pokemontrades,not_removed,plus a code if you want ivs if its just nature then a comp shiny or equivalentpreferably equivalent oo xx per nature knocked off so you would be correct i am willing to offer a discount to those i have trade history with or that want multiple codes redeemed
pokemontrades,not_removed,perfect nonshiny the mother one other breedable perfect shiny the mother codesevents keep in mind i may have one shiny project ahead of you i can offer a discount from these rates that if you want both the nonshiny will only require the mother
pokemontrades,not_removed,no problem you can just tag it under the giveaway tag i guess right coming online in a sec
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah ok that seems awfully high in my experience a jpn redeem of natures generally costs like one shiny maybe a couple if the person values their time high for natures youre offering na redeems which have much lower demand given that this is a largely nabased board and while i can see the reasoning behind your wanting to be compensated for your time the shiny count doesnt really sync up natures is frankly not hard so spending the time it would take to do shinies doesnt make any sense for that when you have sr odds ranging from to getting closer to single nature sr yeah that is much harder since that can take srs sometimes but even then its still not going to take nearly as long as doing shinies i would spend like an hour on that with the chance to get lucky and get it in minutes versus spending like a week on that shiny count i dont mean to burst your bubble or anything but i dont think youll have much luck with those rates i dont want to hold you to a concrete set rate but something like comp shinies maybe for single nature as suggested above would be more realistic hopefully that helps
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have to pass then i consider it your job to get the parent and breed on the egg moves good luck
pokemontrades,not_removed,not sure i would probably just mark it under shiny since its a hatch for you and youll just give me whatever then again itll look a bit weird under the thread for spiritomb refs oo
pokemontrades,not_removed,well its half price if youre getting codes redeemed thats why it has interest most people ask for two comp shines per redeem it really takes a day through sve
pokemontrades,not_removed,well i dont always have access to a parent with the ball nature ivs etc that are desired thats why that is in place
pokemontrades,not_removed,idk that shouldnt be a major issue tho youre giving it for free though so i think would be more appropriate right also i just added you
pokemontrades,not_removed,eh id say a single comp is more standard and note that those are more for foreign redeems which have more demand and its not that realistic to churn out that many shinies in a day on svex for each one you have to bike around get several eggs check them and coordinate with a hatcher one shiny is quick but as you go higher the order takes a while to complete in full that compared to a nature sr which very rarely takes more than an hour also half price isnt mentioned you may want to add that plus half price is still shinies for a single nature sr for nature etc which remains steep
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi just for future reference the tag should not be used in a situation like this where there is one specific intended recipient the best place to confirm a single egg giveaway would be a tsv thread
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay but im pretty sure giveaway is only for threads perhaps we should ask a modsomeone experienced
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh yeah i take it no interest in what im offering xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,eh it may be steep but its standard thanks anyway though i beleive i mentioned bulk discounts though maybe not let me look
pokemontrades,not_removed,it was not edited
pokemontrades,not_removed,just for future reference the tag should not be used in a situation like this where there is one specific intended recipient oh ok we werent very sure hahaha thanks for letting us know the best place to confirm a single egg giveaway would be a tsv thread i thought so may wanted to move it to rpokemontrades tho so yeah makes sense
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi please dont post a giveaway thread if youre just giving away one thing to someone specific documenting it in the tsv thread is fine
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont know im still waiting for you to add me though its almost midnight here and i need to wake up early tomorrow
pokemontrades,not_removed,i am interested indeed lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,are you saying that your rates for redeems is standard according to whats normal here at pokemontrades
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay thanks i wasnt planning on making a thread sorry for being vague about that
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright alright one second
pokemontrades,not_removed,lol in which stuff xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,well i did investigate other rates and for nature yes not many people offer ivs so its hard to tell there
pokemontrades,not_removed,no worries i saw the comment so i thought id clarify
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks hahaha sorry for being pushy its just that im very tired lmao
pokemontrades,not_removed,absolutly not iv been around for around years and the rates have never been as high as yours normaly a sr is comp shinys but ok you are free to charge what you want
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes thank you for doing so

pokemontrades,not_removed,hello question is there any way to get a contrary snivy at the moment in sun and moonor do we have to wait for the pokemon bank to work
pokemontrades,not_removed,heyo folks i was looking in my pokémon spreadsheets and i was noticing that a lot of the sprites linked from serebii just doesnt work now anyone else have this problem and maybe a solution
pokemontrades,not_removed,obligatory sign of life here hope you are all doing well edit pbtrplhqttxdv free tcp code for whomever wants it
pokemontrades,not_removed,i finally got pokemon moon a couple days ago and about hours in and i like alot of the changes notably ride pokemon in place of hms the vision line of trainers and a new spin instead of gyms its island challenges oh also love the y button pokeball shortcut anyone else kinda feel theres a lack of gen pokemon tho early game like hrs in it was really low like i saw new pokemon at that point but even hours in while it is better theyre still kinda hard to come by bums me out when i see old pokemon like ones when i was hoping to experience new ones for the first time does it pick up also does z moves replace mega evolutions or are those still a thing too
pokemontrades,not_removed,dunno if you can still redeem it but heres my last glhk pal arceus
pokemontrades,not_removed,heyare there any people have yet to play sunmoon yet
pokemontrades,not_removed,are pokemon bred from hacked parents still legal in sun and moon i heard somewhere that they arent but then i looked it up and it seems that they are edit maybe what i heard to was referring to transferring pokemon i am not sure
pokemontrades,not_removed,is mareanie a good pokemon to breed and trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,did you put your solgaleolunala in the box or in party i never did put legendary pokemon in my team but i just couldnt box it after what happened so slowbro is now in the spa also the first legendary i gave nickname to
pokemontrades,not_removed,so i spent about hours sos chaining magikarpgyarados last night and while im sure i had some high iv and ha pokemon show up i didnt get a shiny anyone having this same issue
pokemontrades,not_removed,i saw some people talking about a pokemon competition in london sometime in the next two weeks what sort of information has been announced ive tried looking for it but not found anything
pokemontrades,not_removed,will gyarados access to splash which can be turned into a attack zmove make gyarados more viable in ou or will the potential presence of pokemon like tapu koko make him less viable
pokemontrades,not_removed,is anyone still interested in gen giveaways i have some breedjects to give away but not sure it its worth the hassle now
pokemontrades,not_removed,when bank comes out in january we wont be able to transfer gen gen but will we still be able to pull stuff out of the bank to gen if it came from and was never in i am trying to see if i need to rush to finish my living dex before january

pokemontrades,not_removed,how are we able to get the mega stones unavailable in sm is the bank the only way once it is enabled im asking because i skipped oras and i would love nothing more than finally being able to use mega sceptile but as it seems there is no sceptilite in sm

pokemontrades,not_removed,is there a way to check my trainer stats eggs hatched trades made etc in friend plaza i can check everyone elses but my own
pokemontrades,not_removed,just came back from doing hours of christmas shopping i even went inside a girly store just to get a gift for my friend
pokemontrades,not_removed,i know that this sub has an irc chat but are there any plans to start a discord server theres one for rpokemon but the trades that i would make there arent as moderated
pokemontrades,not_removed,so has there been confirmation on wether the unique pokemon in sumo are shiny locked or not
pokemontrades,not_removed,do trades on other reddits like rbankballexchange count towards flairs on flairhq
pokemontrades,not_removed,are beast ball pokes moreas valuable as bank ball pokes
pokemontrades,not_removed,random questiondont know if this is better on the general pokemon reddit but here goes when bank becomes available for sunmoon in jando we think that saved up bp from bank will be transferable to gen or will they be lostonly available to gen thoughts
pokemontrades,not_removed,so now that my adult life is claiming down and i can get back to my pokemoning did i hear right that you can get the greninja from the demo somehow and if so how do i go about it
pokemontrades,not_removed,when i was fillling my living dex there were a lot of generous folks here happy to trade thir legit events for what i later realized was garbage a shiny goldeen in return heres an na arceus code
pokemontrades,not_removed,how do i post what im looking for sorry new to the sub
pokemontrades,not_removed,ive at least saved my sun took it out put it alphasapphire opened mystery gift tried to put in a code that was put on reddit as a giveaway but walked away in dissapointment because the code was redeemed already and there was no comment below the post saying that the code was taken times today not trying to create any hate but if you took a code from a giveaway at least comment below so other people wont have to waste time entering a used code
pokemontrades,not_removed,my friend and i are online in the festival plaza but we cant find each other on the trade link page to initiate a trade what are we doing wrong we are friends on the
pokemontrades,not_removed,how do people find out about their pokemons iv values
pokemontrades,not_removed,that is some excellent luck also nice choice with the fast ball
pokemontrades,not_removed,great thank you noticing d finnish facebook site of bergsala have now posted that info too hurray were finally getting our metal bugs only days late xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,looks like we have to wait since island scan mons cant have hidden abilities
pokemontrades,not_removed,no solution here but ive noticed the same serebii sprites have always been iffy for me so i avoid them but ive still tended to use them for ball sprites and lately balls have gone kaput
pokemontrades,not_removed,im not about how to deal with ball sprites but for pokemon sprites i use httpwwwpokestadiumcomassetsimgspritesmisciconssylveonpng another option httpsrawgithubusercontentcommsikmapokespritemastericonspokemonregularsylveonpng just change the pokemon name in url to what you need
pokemontrades,not_removed,yup they are the worst i have to imagine it is all the extra load from sm players using poké earth d
pokemontrades,not_removed,i really dislike the lack of availability of new mons they are spread out thin across the routes and islands and a good chunk of them are encounters its taken me at least an hour to find a few of them comfey took me hours at a encounter megas are post game only but not all of them are even available i heard but i am not a fan of them so im ok with that
pokemontrades,not_removed,yo riding tauros is the best thing this series has ever done screw bicycles im gonna ride this wild bull about the lack of new pokémon dont forget that there are also the alolan forms that are new id have to agree with you though there arent a ton that show up early and often
pokemontrades,not_removed,as long as the parents have a legal combination of ball and moves certain egg moves are impossible to obtain right now in sm until bank release the offsrping is completly legal since its done between game mechanics
pokemontrades,not_removed,i see it traded quite alot on this sub might be oversaturated and not really worth ur time
pokemontrades,not_removed,toxapek is really good in ou smogon singles right now so if you play that format then it is definitely worth it
pokemontrades,not_removed,no its been done to death make a few if you get one from a trade because it is a desirable pokemon but definitely dont start from scratch or make a lot of them find a pokemon people arent working on much and breed that
pokemontrades,not_removed,it alternates between box and party for the main story its in the box because it makes it too easy for side stuff or messing around its in my party
pokemontrades,not_removed,i put it in my box after sring it dont want it to gain any unwanted evs
pokemontrades,not_removed,im keeping a solgaleo and a lunala i traded for in my party indefinitely in a game without any field moves such as hms or sweet scent in that they s are the closest we have to hm slaves since they open up a new area i want to s access the alternate world at any time and for that having both in my team is a necessity i never thought id genuinely say the box legendaries are the sole pseudohm slaves in a game yet here we are
pokemontrades,not_removed,managed to sr because im too damn stubborn to use bottlecaps
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry but this post has been removed as posts asking for free pokémoncodes are against our httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikirules
pokemontrades,not_removed,sos chaining works to increase the likeliness of getting a shiny but in the end its still pure chance there is no do x amount of chain get shiny i once got a shiny after a chain of but that is the only one i ever got just keep at it
pokemontrades,not_removed,i spent about hours doing a bounsweet you have to be uber patient
pokemontrades,not_removed,does that even increase shiny odds shinies are very rare still
pokemontrades,not_removed,trust nintendotpc to have so little details and fanfare before the biggest pokemon event in europe this monthyear
pokemontrades,not_removed,httpwwwpokemoncomuspokemonnewsbattleatthepokemoneuropeaninternationalchampionships
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont know a lot about singles but since the zmove is only once a match and you will lose the attack boost if you are forced to swap i dont think it will get much play plus you have to give up an item for it doesnt seem worth it to me
pokemontrades,not_removed,remember with the influx of new users that come this time of year there will be plenty of new players who got their for only instead of sm for closer to
pokemontrades,not_removed,im pretty sure its available for jpn gamesconsoles already with the qr code that you get from watching the movie the rest of the world gets magearna on december so pretty soon i think this one is being released on the official website for people to scan
pokemontrades,not_removed,i know an na magearna comes december via qr code
pokemontrades,not_removed,the big thing is that males can now pass down their pokeball when breeding with a ditto or a female of the same species for either ball other than that everything should be the same i dont think oras had any breeding changes from xy
pokemontrades,not_removed,you can catch only one you have to go either of the places serebii listed for the nihilego to appear
pokemontrades,not_removed,bank doesnt accept items currently though is the thing so i doubt itll be via bank
pokemontrades,not_removed,if you want to use mega sceptile then youll need to get oras as its not possible to transfer items
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello sorry but i have removed this as we do not allow trading in the daily discussion and question thread did you mean to post
pokemontrades,not_removed,httpwwwserebiinetsunmoonusefulshtml check iv judge
pokemontrades,not_removed,pretty sure the daily thread is just temporary for the release of the new game so thats probably why its not mentioned i normally dont see this many tradeback and casual threads so im guessing the mods will take it down once the rush of the new games is over
pokemontrades,not_removed,nope its been discussed but we prefer to stick with irc
pokemontrades,not_removed,all except typenull are shiny locked
pokemontrades,not_removed,i believe only trades in rpokemontrades and egg hatching in rsvexchange count towards your flair for flairhq
pokemontrades,not_removed,depends on the person beast balls do have an extremely low capture rate but bank balls are still transferable which ever one the person likes better i guess
pokemontrades,not_removed,i think it depends on the pokemonball combination since im sure some of the transfer only balls like safari and sports will still be more valuable specially on male onlygenderless pokemon same with dream balls
pokemontrades,not_removed,i would assume it would be redeemable in gen because nintendo is giving us this experience without pokemon from previous gens but anything could happen its gamefreak after all
pokemontrades,not_removed,once you beat the demo you can talk to kukui in the pokemon center to send gift from the demo to pokemon sun and moon one of the being ashgreninja
pokemontrades,not_removed,pick a category for what you want to trade casualcompetitive etc and enter the title lf something looking for and then ft something for what ever you are offering to trade do check with the rules of the sub before posting anything
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks sring him was a pain with only one ball and no way to status him lol glad i got him as quick as i did
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah mani just hope i can snag a female contrary snivy in the future i have female snivys but none have the coveted contrary skill
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah honestly id prefer something like pure new gen pokemon with prev gen pokemon appearing once elite four are beaten or something or whatever it is in this game i dont wanna know yet playing blind
pokemontrades,not_removed,yup not even all of them they left out mega tyranitar with my username being how it is its a tragedy
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah tauros is awesome i think bicycles kinda made less sense after running shoes came in cuz the speed difference was little tauros seems way faster tho as for alolan forms i like to see them but i dont feel the need to catch them tho once the bank update releases i will if they stay that way in bank
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok thank you
pokemontrades,not_removed,same
pokemontrades,not_removed,sring for ivs yikes i just synchronized it
pokemontrades,not_removed,your spoiler is leaking
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh nice getting up to level is hard too in this game
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,i thought that was the case i want a red gyarados dammit
pokemontrades,not_removed,a bunch of stuff ive read says it does but ¯ツ¯
pokemontrades,not_removed,seems weird yknow
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah alright
pokemontrades,not_removed,true but it freed up choice band for use elsewhere youd want to remove or cripple faster threats though first and theres better options for sweepers people are talking about using it on solgaleo as well though plus attack in one turn is nothing to scoff at
pokemontrades,not_removed,that being said zconversion porygon z is making huge rounds atm
pokemontrades,not_removed,think you replied to the wrong user here
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea i have found the qr code already as well as some instructions on how to region spoof etc but as i have probably mentioned i do not have such capabilities i know that december isnt far away but i might as well try to get it on my jpn cart now
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea i saw on the official site that it goes live on december for my home region
pokemontrades,not_removed,another big thing is that pokemon no longer gain experience points while in the daycare so no more egg moves being overwritten by level up moves d
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh wow so its just random balls it could be in if its different balls is it same ball if both parents are in same one also by any chance do you know if the shiny value still functions the same with powersaver
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh come on now dont tell me there is no way
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,i see thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,that is correct the daily trading thread is temporary and will stop being posted once things die down a bit
pokemontrades,not_removed,welp atleast they gave us typenull thanks for answering
pokemontrades,not_removed,i hope sostarting to get a little stockpile from stored pokemonwould be helpful for getting battle items that cant be transferred with the pokemon from gen
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for the tip
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay cool how does shiny trading work on the sub
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea i made a smeargle with spore and leveled it up but it is useless on koko d
pokemontrades,not_removed,good luck its not too hard you just need patience talking about gen female contrary snivy by the way
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah thats how the first games in gen was and i loved it basically it just takes a while to get a team of new gen mons that you wanna use for a playthrough if you dont want to use past gen stuff frankly i dont understand why people wanna use past gen mons in a new gen either but to each their own i guess
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont like megas so they could leave them all out next time thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,i feel the same way about the alolan forms im not all that interested in them i wanted to use all new pokemon for my ingame team so i almost felt kinda limited
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea i synched it too for modest but i had to get some nice ivs too got
pokemontrades,not_removed,maybe and svexchange
pokemontrades,not_removed,ive heard that hitting a improves catch rates too p maybe it increases odds like the way you could increase odds with chains in oras but im not certain it does it increases odds of ha and odds of good ivs also increasing shiny odds is asking for a lot
pokemontrades,not_removed,nah theyre just kinda when it comes to organising events in general at least in the uk im afraid i cant say more for reasons
pokemontrades,not_removed,plus attack in one turn is nothing to scoff at i agree i just think you give up a lot to get it and there are better sweepers out there but like i said i singles arent really my thing so it would not surprise me if he was good at countering a specific team im curious if we will see any splash in vgc since it can be easier to set up with help from a partner
pokemontrades,not_removed,not at all if there are new users coming to gen games i bet they would be happy to get pokémon from a giveaway
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh yeah i cant believe i forgot that that might be my favorite thing about this gen
pokemontrades,not_removed,lets say you have a male eevee in a love ball and a female eevee in a moon ball the ditto is in a great ball but that doesnt matter female eevee with ditto always moon male eevee with ditto always love eevee with eevee love moon eevee with eevee both in love balls always love female eevee with male mawile in a great ball always moon no idea about the ps stuff sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,idk
pokemontrades,not_removed,with enough luck the game might get updated with the missing mega stones once the pokebank gets updated if not well have to wait for some sort of distribution i guess like with torchick back in xy
pokemontrades,not_removed,i believe that game freak said items wont be transferrable so bp usable in gen would be the most ideal
pokemontrades,not_removed,the same not that i ever did one it should be the same just add shiny to whatever lf or ft keep in mind that all trades here have to be legit ones
pokemontrades,not_removed,wait why is spore useless on koko
pokemontrades,not_removed,in regards to tradingor breeding im hoping to get one via trading
pokemontrades,not_removed,lol exactly im too stubborn to use older gen ones so for a while it was just then finally got some more but vs fire and ice im screwed lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,eh it was sort of an odd concept so i see where youre coming from but i wish it was either all of them or none of them
pokemontrades,not_removed,it does increase shiny odds theres a calculator somewhere showing you the depending on how many calls youve had
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i want to try him out in battle tree he would benefit a lot from tailwind support too
pokemontrades,not_removed,you were right i somehow didnt make the connection between the two comments my bad
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you so much for clearing that up that was a huge change feels less tedious now
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea items cant be transferred through bank so im really hoping the bp from bank can go to sunmoon
pokemontrades,not_removed,what do you mean by legit like legit pokémon
pokemontrades,not_removed,electric terrain lasts for turns and makes him unable to be put asleep when ur softresetting with only ball waiting turns just to spore doesnt seem worth it to me
pokemontrades,not_removed,both although you need to have a contrary snivy or evolution to start breeding it contrary serperior was an extremely easy to obtain event pokemon nonevent ones are even more common
pokemontrades,not_removed,cool
pokemontrades,not_removed,no hacks no clones no funny business simply put stuff that you can acquire through regular playthrough of the games although there are certain exceptions allowed that require disclosure also no pokemons of questionable origins wonder trade gts passerby trades
pokemontrades,not_removed,pokemon that can be obtained through gameplay or official events which means no pokemon that are hacked obtained through third party software and pokemon that came from online interactions with uncertain legitimacy ie gts or wonder trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,huh never knew about this does the same applies to other terrain
pokemontrades,not_removed,thats good then what about a female though those tend to be prized oo
pokemontrades,not_removed,so my shiny level adamant inciniroar is probably not legitimate than huh
pokemontrades,not_removed,tapu finis terrain prevents all status conditions
pokemontrades,not_removed,its just a chance plus or was it chance of inheriting the hidden ability it will require some patience but its not impossible ive got a bunch of females with has that i bred myself
pokemontrades,not_removed,well that depends where did you get it from
pokemontrades,not_removed,i guess ill have to contact you when pokemon bank goes live d
pokemontrades,not_removed,gts seemed kinda suspicious seeing as how he only wanted a poplio
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah anything from the gts with an unknown source would be considered hacked
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont mind helping d
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello i was looking to evolve my kadabra too hoped to be able to find someone whit whom i could trade would you care to trade with me ill be adding you as a friend

pokemontrades,not_removed,code recived thanks for trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey i have some stuff interested in that miltank
pokemontrades,not_removed,manaphy shiny bold id i received it in a gts trade and it seems to have come from a korean event hello valuable pokémon from the gts cannot be traded here as they are unfortunately highly likely to be hacked andor cloned please httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikirules before posting here again and do not offer this shiny manaphy here again
pokemontrades,not_removed,i like your eng present set think we can make a deal for that
pokemontrades,not_removed,indeed
pokemontrades,not_removed,how about a eng present set for dat miltank and does it have proof
pokemontrades,not_removed,cool i usually do a download album but i guess i didnt for this one when are you available to trade also would you prefer to do this on gen or
pokemontrades,not_removed,i will be available from pm and gen pls
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright cool were same time zone but my sleep schedule is a bit wacky from working midnights ill try to stay up but it might not happen comment back when youre ready to trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi i am at home
pokemontrades,not_removed,cool do you have any proof for the present set
pokemontrades,not_removed,nope sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh i see i think ill have to back out of the deal then i wouldnt mind the lack of proof if they were going into my personal collection but i was going to put them back on the trading block and theyre a lot harder to move without proof sorry and good luck trading
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure np
pokemontrades,not_removed,how exactly did you obtain each of these
pokemontrades,not_removed,please do not ask other users to pm you as this is against our rpokemontradeswikirules all trade negotiations must take place publicly on the subreddit additionally trades that are against our rpokemontradeswikirules cannot be discussed here
pokemontrades,not_removed,you need to reply directly to my comment or it doesnt notify me that you replied you need to be more specific which ones did you breed yourself and which did you trade for
pokemontrades,not_removed,genesect will be available at gamestops in two days
pokemontrades,not_removed,interested in a language set shaymin reservation since they arent obtainable yet xd i guarantee attack natures on all of them so chances are youll receive at least one semicompcomp one they come with two of the following proof types of your choice both of our usernames included is standard the other proof type comes at one comp shiny or equivalent because im lazy and proof takes work xd video of the first ones receive picture of receiving them all wc of them all i can also offer bulk discounts since we have trade history edit heres what id like that youre offering wishmaker natures of jolly adamant hasty naive timid modest serenas fennekinpartly just to rub it in face xd jk keep my posted on your pika if anyone does trade a miltank or gardevoir code let me know judging by your rates it would be gards per sets per cow maybe the present serperior and emboar but theyre not worth much without samurott to complete the set the events maybe the vivs since mine dont have proof
pokemontrades,not_removed,if you wanna do a huge order id be willing to supply you with jirachi
pokemontrades,not_removed,also i thought you were going to farm yourself utailsmegamanx
pokemontrades,not_removed,edit read the edit xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,im too lazy to post the details again
pokemontrades,not_removed,if you want specified nature ill do one per set due to the randomness of it fennekin i really want to get it and while im willing to help her she doesnt really have any wants of mine
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i know thats what i was thinking as well and i know thats part of why i wanted it xd i might have been able to get her to take it
pokemontrades,not_removed,i really want tawmie to get scraps for it maybe
pokemontrades,not_removed,i look at your threads lmao has specifically said that they have scraps to trade for it xd multiple times im sure tawmiecerenadewhatever will tell you that yiu were told that even faster than me
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for the link to the thread ive already gotten a response there is another person who also posted though
pokemontrades,not_removed,so i do have a new breeding client three different tsv shinies because the other person beat me to it but anything is fine i guess and so how many sets were you thinking of getting i also am willing to do them all of onetwo natures if you would offer higher for it
pokemontrades,not_removed,meh i wouldnt trade scraps for a wifi event anyways im sure someone will trade it to me for comp shinies or a couple darkrai codes if i asked scraps is way too much for something like that considering tails paid only darkrai codes for it
pokemontrades,not_removed,well i wanted sets which is a lot we can either do wshmkr per set or custom wshmkr per set along with dud id prefer the first set
pokemontrades,not_removed,very true im kinda trying to get it for only a max of language sets tbh but i probably wouldnt do a jpn event for shinies oo
pokemontrades,not_removed,well im willing to do all five any more youd want id prefer per set unless you mean comp thats for the first two sets therefore jirachi shaymin the other three perhaps we could work something out for multiple sets
pokemontrades,not_removed,and your fennekin has gone from being desired by all to getting bashed about its worth xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,it was a jpn wifi event so anyone with a jpn console could farm it hence why it isnt worth so much plus it was available with the code for a full month
pokemontrades,not_removed,well i thought about it and honestly youre too nice jirachi with no nature pref per set sets total x jirachi
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah my point exactly
pokemontrades,not_removed,i got one what are your gastlys details
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have one male with all perfect ivs except health and a bold nature one female with all perfect ivs except health again and a gentle nature and another male with all perfect ivs except speed and a lonely nature

pokemontrades,not_removed,i think i used up mine i could always make some more care to tell me what youre offering
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry but i already have those
pokemontrades,not_removed,can i get a bit more info on your lileep
pokemontrades,not_removed,im more interested in perfect than imperfects honestly so im a bit shaky on your current offer as well for my eevee i would like something with the matching low rate gender rate i didnt see any on your list that i dont already have the only gender rates you have are lux zorua dream snorlax and dream togepi right
pokemontrades,not_removed,that doesnt really seem fair i mean with gender rates it seems like your not getting a good deal here
pokemontrades,not_removed,any dream ball female you want im looking for amaze mulch
pokemontrades,not_removed,no problem happy trading
pokemontrades,not_removed,female lileep calm nest ball storm drain em recover barrier mirror coat tickle i dont have any comp on hand but i have speed
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have mistaken i really thought you are interested in imperfect well would you mind take a look in my onhand comp sheet i have a few perfect female in that list
pokemontrades,not_removed,dont worry about it i bred up my full set of eeveelutions awhile ago these are just leftover breedjects i have laying around getting my trade flair up with another trade on my belt is worth it
pokemontrades,not_removed,do any have ivs and egg moves
pokemontrades,not_removed,well i could wait for a comp one im in no rush to trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah im sorry but im not seeing anything i really want there sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,well im not really looking for breedrejects do you happen to have anything that a perfect with comp ivs
pokemontrades,not_removed,i breed every dream ball ha female with my iv ditto that holds a destiny knot so you should get some random ones but i dont promise exact ivs some of them do have egg moves if you want any particulars ill have to go through my boxes for you
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok np i can take a breedject if you have one also i have a wurmple bold atk in friend ball
pokemontrades,not_removed,alrighty thank you for your time
pokemontrades,not_removed,i think i have a bergmite both a and a
pokemontrades,not_removed,this being a comp thread and all i think im going to pass sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,i actually do not have any breedjects of the togepi were you looking for anything else for the wurmple
pokemontrades,not_removed,no thank you
pokemontrades,not_removed,fair enough
pokemontrades,not_removed,dbha qwilfish would be nice
pokemontrades,not_removed,no worries thanks anyway

pokemontrades,not_removed,wait im confused now you want both of those for your imperfect
pokemontrades,not_removed,ops sorry i missread my mistake i have a spreadsheet with comps but i dont need so much the togepi cause i dont liked so much the dusk ball so if you want the wurmple we can trade now and really sorry but i have like boxes with breedjects and im working in all of them lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,i think im going to pass sorry if you wanted to trade both as perfects i would have been down for it but im not really down for just trading for the wurmple

pokemontrades,not_removed,what nature is the liberty pass victini
pokemontrades,not_removed,check events tab for darkrai intrested in your keldeo
pokemontrades,not_removed,is the liberty pass victini untouched
pokemontrades,not_removed,not all is ft though interested in the older events
pokemontrades,not_removed,what are the natures of your keldeos
pokemontrades,not_removed,non comp will check for exact
pokemontrades,not_removed,yup untouched
pokemontrades,not_removed,a hayley mew is at the top of my wish list but i have an inkling its not available were you interested in both
pokemontrades,not_removed,one modest one not so modest lol non comp might even be detrimental would prefer to hold onto the modest one for a semigood natured event mon
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont mind non comp was just interested im assuming youre looking for non events for it
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay im willing to offer one of my spare events for it an event i have more than one of let me know if youre interested
pokemontrades,not_removed,well yea and i dont mind but mind trading it with the phione
pokemontrades,not_removed,id be willing to trade a darkrai and a manaphy for the modest one both are and were redeemed by me with wc proof
pokemontrades,not_removed,for the most part entertaining offers first
pokemontrades,not_removed,sheet thanks for the offer nothing you have spares of checks all the boxes for me at the moment but ill see what offers i get and get back to you
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry not particularly interested in phione if youre interested in both we can potentially do some sort of package deal
pokemontrades,not_removed,now thats a pretty good offer what natures if i may ask edit and did you have any other spare on the same tier as manaphy you also may want to add your full info as required by rule before the mods sweep down
pokemontrades,not_removed,do you have any other events youd be willing to let go of
pokemontrades,not_removed,darkrai is naughty or gentle and manaphy is docile
pokemontrades,not_removed,if you see someone you believe is breaking the rules just report it please
pokemontrades,not_removed,ive got two shaymins also self redeemed with wc proof and for events you dont need to post the ot and id as long as you post which event theyre from i can add them if youd prefer
pokemontrades,not_removed,really only some the keldeo and a pal genesect code thats burning a hole in my pocket
pokemontrades,not_removed,gentle darkraidocile manaphy are fine my proof if you have yours
pokemontrades,not_removed,if you dont mind me asking what did i not include
pokemontrades,not_removed,hm what do you have and what are their natures
pokemontrades,not_removed,why is the date
pokemontrades,not_removed,dont worry you included all necessary info which is why i didnt ask more of you happy trading
pokemontrades,not_removed,most are noncomp but before i put them on the table seeing as ill have to grab details for them and theyre not all self redeemed i was more less considering packaging the keldeo and the victini together still unsure if you want both or not if youre interested in ill grab my info just let me know if theres one in particular that you have in mind beforehand
pokemontrades,not_removed,was actually just messaging a mod about that full disclosure i switched to another around then and the date setting may have been wrong its legit but both keldeos are like that and chronologically it still occupies the correct slot as you can see if thats an issue no worries we can call it off i had only just noticed it too
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh ok thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh i dont mind both was just worried you wouldnt be willing to let go of both hahah
pokemontrades,not_removed,its not a huge deal but in the state its in id consider it proofless id still be willing to trade one of darkrai or manaphy for it but not both
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh ok would you be willing to do then id be willing to take a commonlower tier event for the second one
pokemontrades,not_removed,thats a very generous offer gentle darkrai would be fine with me would you be able to trade in gen
pokemontrades,not_removed,as in both mew and phione for keldeo and victini or mew and smth else
pokemontrades,not_removed,no mew and something commonlower tier event for my victini keldeo
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh ok what would you regard as a lowtier event
pokemontrades,not_removed,i missed out on hoopa and it seems like you have quite an amount of those if you dont mind
pokemontrades,not_removed,np but what nature would you like
pokemontrades,not_removed,hasty one would be great
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok then want to trade this in gen or
pokemontrades,not_removed,theyre all in so that would be preferred if you got wc proof as well that would be swell
pokemontrades,not_removed,well at the time which i obtained the hoopas i didnt even know how to do proofing so dont have it
pokemontrades,not_removed,did you have any apricorn or db pokemon i have a fast ball growlithe with morning sun and ivs
pokemontrades,not_removed,do you do trades in gen i have a few of those mons youre looking for but i only trade in gen

pokemontrades,not_removed,cool adding you now
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks so much you were a great help
pokemontrades,not_removed,youre welcome i never knew politoed had such a cool shiny form
pokemontrades,not_removed,shiny xerneas are everywhere bc of the mystery gift there hasnt been a shiny groudon giveaway so they are extremely rare nobody will do this trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,what sorta things were you looking for a hoopa
pokemontrades,not_removed,recomment accidentally deleted the first one are gardevoir codes of interest to you for hoopas if so please let me know the rate thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi there im not sure if youll remember but from your previous thread a user offered you a mew language set littletaebaby is the user who rattled off a couple natures and a mew still able to be srd would you still be interested in the set im interested in the hoopas you have the mew set belongs to me all self redeemed with video proof
pokemontrades,not_removed,would u be interested in a shiny xerneas code
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi got any hoopas left
pokemontrades,not_removed,offers are fine but mainly looking for things on that list
pokemontrades,not_removed,whats the trade history on it also does it come with proof
pokemontrades,not_removed,not really sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,depends on how many hoopas you want
pokemontrades,not_removed,hm the things on that list are a decent amount more worth then a hoopa especially since they are reasonably common mac ones atleast anything else youd want
pokemontrades,not_removed,no problem
pokemontrades,not_removed,is it a language set of hoopas or just all eng tagged i understand people value them a bit around here so if its a lang set maybe about of the variants for my complete set unless you want to do to make things even or if theyre all eng then maybe about or im not sure what your rates are im just rattling off a few ideas in my head
pokemontrades,not_removed,i never said i was gonna only trade plus i have other relatively high tier events for trade id prefer offers since im just looking for anything relatively interesting
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry ill pass proof is a must for me
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello do you know where that person got the landorus how confident are you that it is not hacked or cloned
pokemontrades,not_removed,they are all eng tagged ill think about three hoopas but the natures arent the best it seems
pokemontrades,not_removed,thats fine really my own set i didnt sr for all nice natures just for the sake of time but please let me know your rates i appreciate your consideration
pokemontrades,not_removed,i would probably offer hoopas
pokemontrades,not_removed,for how many mew
pokemontrades,not_removed,the language set
pokemontrades,not_removed,damn a bit steep i would have done it for i think ill have to pass then
pokemontrades,not_removed,are you interested in pal xerneas codes miltank code or gengargardevoir codes
pokemontrades,not_removed,interested in the lab squirtle eevee mewtwo and maybe the stuff on your third picture cant view it
pokemontrades,not_removed,im very interested in squirtle i have a bunch of codes like jarvis gengar gardevoir and even can offer wshmkr jirachi i own the bonus disc lemme know im trying for the full set

pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry about the delay just got home and dont have an adament breeding one now
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah eggs are super tradable when they hatch they take up your own ot and tid too and may even hatch shiny where it wouldnt hatch shiny for the other person which people use for their advantage over at rsvexchange
pokemontrades,not_removed,im fine with that unless its porygon d i tried to avoid more than one trade evo mons considering rhyhorn is one too but at least its multi stage and evolves pretty late i can handle it though since itd be a bit stupid to have multiple fully evolved pokemon right off the bat smurfmence is probably already stretching you should also decide at which point of the game im allowed to evolve it eg on which island after beating which challengekahuna etc what do you want in return

pokemontrades,not_removed,japan again
pokemontrades,not_removed,ucrownofnails
pokemontrades,not_removed,more psyducks i need an army
pokemontrades,not_removed,haha just made a post looking for one a second chance
pokemontrades,not_removed,nice time to hoard all of my events that arent in hopes to maybe trade for one
pokemontrades,not_removed,i need one of those masuduck has been one of my wants for a while
pokemontrades,not_removed,na never gets good events
pokemontrades,not_removed,o
pokemontrades,not_removed,
pokemontrades,not_removed,o
pokemontrades,not_removed,well if the shoe fits this puts people from na at huge disadvantage when it comes to trading
pokemontrades,not_removed,i knew this was going to be that pic without even clicking
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah but you have to take into account the size of na compared to japan you can travel to the entire other side of japan by bullet train in about give or take in na it would be days weeks would you really fly all the way to vegas for the weekend just for that mac hoopa with a slightly different idot its really about perspective japan has so many companies that want pokemons advertising over here we have gamestop and uhhh toys r us but they are like halfway in the ground already so you get the idea its just not feasible every event would be a wifi and mass farmed so theyd have no value anyway
pokemontrades,not_removed,o
pokemontrades,not_removed,you are right its about perspective a bullet train from tokyo to osaka costs about the same as a cross country flight from miami to california source ive done that trip now imagine from tip to tip of japan just because it doesnt look that far it doesnt mean that is cheap at all you say would you go to vegas just for an event its the same concept here in japan would you spend to go to a city hours away by bullet train for an event
pokemontrades,not_removed,
pokemontrades,not_removed,o
pokemontrades,not_removed,i didnt know that about the prices there that is really ridiculous
pokemontrades,not_removed,🔥🔥🔥
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey again i could knock out a few of these for you for a dman code but itll probably be a little while before i can start not sure if that would be a problem
pokemontrades,not_removed,which ones were you thinking about being able to do
pokemontrades,not_removed,well the bunnelby is a project i did a few months back so its very likely i could get one of those eggs hatched the hoothoot looks cool so id like to do that the baltoys and i would do joltik if youre okay with an ultraball andor buneary if i can change the punch moves since theyre move tutor moves lmk what you think
pokemontrades,not_removed,bunnelby hoothoot baltoys and joltik would be great
pokemontrades,not_removed,sounds good i should be able to start in a week at the most
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey have you been able to start yet the code expires the
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey i have had some stupid problems lately the main one being my laptop dying on me so i havent started i have a ton of free time this weekend though and should be able to get them all at least bred then ill keep you updated
pokemontrades,not_removed,any update we are getting close to the expiration date of the d code
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey yea i cant believe its already the i have a bucnh of baltoys bred and finally got keysav working last night so i can check the perfect bunnelby eggs i have and see if i need to breed more i just checked and found out that i dont have a fastball hoothoot any more but ill put a thread up now to try to get one ive got nothing to do besides this for the next like hours and ill let you know how close i am around then
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey any luckprogress if so can you post details of ones you have completed
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey i have to apologize again at this point im fairly certain that i wont be able to finish your shinies before the darm redemption period ends just been trying to finally finish some other customs for a d code trade agreed upon a week or before this one those have been bred but i wanted to wait to ask for hatches until they were all done then my laptop broke and thats slowed me down way more than usual i still have every intention of finishing your shinies for you but doubt itll be in time so feel free to redeem or trade that code before its too late
pokemontrades,not_removed,i guess i will try and trade it for something else then
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright gl btw i did get a bunnelby hatched and found a fast hoothoot im trading to get
pokemontrades,not_removed,well if you are interested in swapping some those for some of my shiny that would be cool
pokemontrades,not_removed,ill just finish breeding those and gift them to you
pokemontrades,not_removed,that is mighty kind of you are you sure there arent any shiny that you would like in return
pokemontrades,not_removed,no thats alright i feel bad that i wasnt able to come through and finish our trade plus im kind of ridiculously picky about my shinies after losing all of them a year ago
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok well thanks in advance and i am always happy to hatch for you

pokemontrades,not_removed,one was bred by chispa himself and the other was gotten through a friend who bred it ive talked with chispa enough to know he puts in effort into breeding and masuda so im quite sure one is also only if that helps to lessen the risk
pokemontrades,not_removed,no particular name and yes
pokemontrades,not_removed,hopping on now obviously my first ones were female lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,i havent seen you on whats up

pokemontrades,not_removed,yah sure ill take a dream ball smoochum if you dont mind just hold on a sec im getting pokebank errors
pokemontrades,not_removed,all done adding you now nbsp unfortunately snivy didnt want to hatch female in batches chance for a female so i hope a perfect ha male with egg moves will suffice itll add an extra step if you want to breed a ball on it eventually but with a little luck and some more patience than i had it should be easy to get a female one from here nbsp mincinnos got a premier ball and egg moves on her so i hope youll like that i made her nearly a perfect spread iv in speed to make up for the lack of a female snivy nbsp if this is okay with you we can trade in a bit
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks a lot dude
pokemontrades,not_removed,i still need it was waiting for your reply will be at the plaza now sorry bout that

pokemontrades,not_removed,heliolisk ot id no ven liepard ot id no emerl both received via the unofficial pokemon sunmoon discord via a guy called dr chispa there emerl is his ot name since most other trading websites and communities are less serious about legitimacy valuable pokémon obtained from these places are unfortunately likely to be hacked andor cloned do not offer these shinies here please be more mindful of the httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikirules as we take legitimacy very seriously here also you still need to respond to my other query also since you have mentioned that you have more shinies please make sure to list them along with the required details

pokemontrades,not_removed,ok gimme a min to wrap things up
pokemontrades,not_removed,ready tell me if you want to trade now
pokemontrades,not_removed,lapras is in a lureball right
pokemontrades,not_removed,yep im online
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes
pokemontrades,not_removed,tell me if youre ready to trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok adding you youll be the inviter
pokemontrades,not_removed,i am adding you and heading to the plaza
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok me too
pokemontrades,not_removed,youll be the inviter
pokemontrades,not_removed,i can offer dream radar rngs with custom ot i can do the genies dialga and hooh they will be rngd on a retail black cart note that i use homebrew to manage my black cart i also uninstall and reinstall dream radar to reset the save file how many rngs would you want and how many vulpixes would you do edit alternatively i can also offer events from my topic i would probably only trade events above the bolded line though
pokemontrades,not_removed,pc vulpix timid from cptbuzzlightyear for a few of these vulpixes
pokemontrades,not_removed,im interested in the dream radar rngs could i pick the ot for them that shouldnt be too hard i have no problem doing a few vulpixes currently i have unclaimed save files at the first pokemon center ive been trying to do at least a day in advance of the event i saw your sheet are you willing to trade your modest diancie for a few vulpixes or any of the shiny rayquazas
pokemontrades,not_removed,how many would you like is fair
pokemontrades,not_removed,what lang is the pc vulpix i prefer jpn or eng
pokemontrades,not_removed,i can do custom ot would you do vulpixes for rngs playing through dream radar takes around days since its time gated i wouldnt trade the diancie or shiny rayquazas though
pokemontrades,not_removed,well i dont know how you may value it but these vulpix will be available via a common code so really for an in life event would be rather low for me but if youre rnging these then its a different story
pokemontrades,not_removed,fair enough on the others would nature vulpixes presumably timid for the rngs be ok would you suggest iv spreads or should i come up with what i want
pokemontrades,not_removed,cant rng on a korean console but i can nature redeem based on what ive seen right now seems fair to me would be enough to convince you
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah one natures would be okay do you want me to suggest iv spreads or do you want to choose your own i can do either and yeah timid sounds good
pokemontrades,not_removed,what about with a nature redeem
pokemontrades,not_removed,i would like you to suggest iv spreads and then i can comment i think ive never used the genies before ill check smogon when you suggest spreads one we have the full deal i will make a confirmatory post posting everything from both sides
pokemontrades,not_removed,ehhh alright the history is cptbuzzlightyear to you only
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay ill post some spreads for the genies when im home hooh and dialga are pretty standard spreads did you want full on the hooh or sp atk
pokemontrades,not_removed,yep thats it id like video proof if its not too much trouble otherwise picture is fine as long as full from start assuming it does start on the id like the following details tbdprobably last date of distribution period all to be timidmodest is this ok edit date formate ddmmyy
pokemontrades,not_removed,i prefer in the not important stat so for hooh that would be sp at could my custom ot be fmdvdt i dont care about the id so much once we have the deal with all the spreads i will post a confirmatory post with both sides
pokemontrades,not_removed,that works although it is possible we may not know the last date of the distribution for a while we may know it video proof is fine each video will be around though is that ok if not i can do pictures you dont want odd days p ill type up a trade confirmation and then start to work on your saves
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay so that ot wont work because black ots can only be characters long max for iv spreads remember they all have ha tornadus jolly for tornadusi or naivehasty for tornadust thundurus naive landorus naive or timid dialga modest hooh adamant
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah p im not an odd man you know file size is not a problem just as long as i can see everything happening including the date also hopefully we find out the last day about a week into the event i dont know if youre comfortable with it or not but i wouldnt mind waiting until it is known xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,what about ot pmv instead and could i get these spreads tornadus hasty for tornadust please can it be iv if not hasty is fine thundurus modest landorus adamant or jolly preferred dialga modest ok hooh adamant ok
pokemontrades,not_removed,id rather know all the info up front but we can wait a little bit and see if its given out do you know what lang youll want the last one im trying to get save files set up in advance so when it starts i just have to redeem
pokemontrades,not_removed,i can do iv any iv spread is possible since these cant be shiny also for landorus you can only get ha in dream radar and ha works better on a specialmixed set if you use landorusi however its up to you and which of the two do you prefer between adamant and jolly
pokemontrades,not_removed,is landorus i better if so ill take your initial spread i prefer tornadus to be then
pokemontrades,not_removed,technically landorusi is uber while landorust is ou
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok lets do landorusi then with your initial spread
pokemontrades,not_removed,what about ot pmv instead and could i get these spreads tornadus hasty is fine thundurus modest landorus naive dialga modest ok hooh adamant ok ot pmv
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i can do that you sure you dont want hp ice on thundurus or landorus
pokemontrades,not_removed,oooooooh thats the spread i was wondering why the were there sorry yeah i want hp ice can you list all with the final spreads i want
pokemontrades,not_removed,tornadus hasty thundurus modest landorus naive dialga modest hooh adamant ot pmv
pokemontrades,not_removed,correct and in exchange you are getting nature vulpix timid i assume can you specify the date lang nature you want each
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes i want timid on all kor and eng on april kor on april

pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont really care about the name tbh anyway i think ill give you kyurem did you want the fused or unfused kyurem also im cool with giving you groudon for the dex but you gotta give it back sound cool
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh i dont need groudons dex entry a living dex means owning one of everything but thanks for the offer either kyurem form is fine with me so whatevers easiest for you adding you now

pokemontrades,not_removed,not a problem i can get ems on it thanks for the heads up though also idc about ivs just the ball really go ahead and trade me when ready
pokemontrades,not_removed,its weird how it works the new female you get of nidoran should have all the male might be different though honestly really bizzare
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for the trade ignore the fact that it is level that was an accident still has all ems

pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah thats fine get back to me at your convenience if you find anything else cool that would be neat not terribly in need of a volcanion but dont mind helping someone out
pokemontrades,not_removed,just seeing if youre still interested
pokemontrades,not_removed,ohhhh i missed that last part never mind then its better others get it but if noone offers id love to trade for the celebi
pokemontrades,not_removed,looks like its been quiet noticed you have mews on your sheet id be willing to do celebi for one of the mews if youre up for it
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry just looking to trade my ft events
pokemontrades,not_removed,so would you not be interested in trading the celebi for a manaphy i can throw in a shiny as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,hmm didnt see anything of particular interest i think as of late ive been aiming to acquire a mew so ill likely hold onto what i have here as trade fodder for now thanks for your time though

pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont want to keep any zygardes i just want the dex entry if you want legendaries just for dex entries then i have xerneas yveltal darkrai victini manaphy shaymin hooh lugia the three main regis and a bunch of phione eggs including a hatched one the only legendary im willing to permanently give up is any of the phiones but that would be a ripoff for a zygarde
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah fair enough yeah man or even if you just need one or two tomorrow i can help you out
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh i already have all of those lol nvm then but i would let you keep a zygarde anyway cause i have
pokemontrades,not_removed,just realized im a bit late going to bed but just figured id let you know someone else got me two of the three and it completed my dex so you arent left hanging thanks again for the offer though if no one else had come along you would have actually completed it d

pokemontrades,not_removed,cool d how many karp codes would you do for the birb of the rainbow
pokemontrades,not_removed,how many codes would you do for palkia
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks you too
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay no problem
pokemontrades,not_removed,one code i could do that what gen is the jirachi on
pokemontrades,not_removed,one of my codes is already reserved actually so i just have one left how many would you be willing to trade it for i might get some more but im not sure about that
pokemontrades,not_removed,well id rather not trade both codes i could do one and add something from my sheet but im actually more interested in hooh
pokemontrades,not_removed,
pokemontrades,not_removed,i was thinking codes for the rainbow birb but the jolly proofless one i could do for code
pokemontrades,not_removed,im about to trade away the hooh unfortunately im interested in chymias gardevoir pc gyarados and pci hydreigon but im not sure if you would add any of those the only reason im asking for more for the palkia is because its rngd and i havent seen too many of them around
pokemontrades,not_removed,perfect i prefer to keep my events on gen when are you available to trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay ill see if i can get more codes i might be interested in the jolly one as well since the lack of proof isnt a deal breaker to me ill let you know
pokemontrades,not_removed,rip i like the nature and the eng tag on the hooh as for the palkia i think id prefer a regular one seeing that i have a noncomp dialga already and a rngd one would cost me a bit too much ill let you know if i change my mind though
pokemontrades,not_removed,tonight probably around gmt
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay sounds good lmk
pokemontrades,not_removed,would you offer any of the other stuff i was interested in for the hooh i dont think its worth karps
pokemontrades,not_removed,im so thatd be am for me i think ill still be around but no promises
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello are you available now im about to head to bed
pokemontrades,not_removed,so i decided that id like to trade one karp code for the jolly hooh if thats all right
pokemontrades,not_removed,so your trade involving the hooh is off i dont know i might decide to take one of hoohs instead i like the gardevoir gyarados and hydreigon maybe i could trade gyarados but did you see that its proofless
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes can you spare minutes for me to get to my ds
pokemontrades,not_removed,sounds great pc shiny hooh jolly capable of taking hits pcキョウト sacred ash uxavierorland me lmk whenever you can trade

pokemontrades,not_removed,ok im done thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh ok thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,anything from
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have a bunch of rngs all info in my do you have any other events
pokemontrades,not_removed,not really sorry thanks for stopping by however
pokemontrades,not_removed,your raikou manaphy ohhh especially the manaphy kyurem and second uxie make me drool my event collection is horrible im tradingive traded my gen events away in different trades so the only other stuff ive got for trade are xyz xerneas ot xyz id no from user foxlery on this sub and xyz yveltal ot xyz id no from user foxlery too if you dont count a few and of course ive got the necessary happy meowths two ot happy id no self redeemed on my x and as so nothing worthy of your pot of gold im afraid if you dont want the palkia
pokemontrades,not_removed,could you do happy meowth language sets
pokemontrades,not_removed,i could actually as long as the event is still running if the language tag depends on the language i choose when starting a game never done that before how many sets would you want and how many rngs id get for them
pokemontrades,not_removed,i could do uxie for a language set also kyurem for another language set
pokemontrades,not_removed,you would deal with the second uxie i mean the ot jelly one from your porybox would that be okay i would do you even two extra sets setting the total at four for that manaphy p but i understand you are not very willing to let go of it
pokemontrades,not_removed,that manaphy is pretty special to me lol can you sr for natures on the meowth if so ill get back to you with details i would give natures or so that i would be ok with and yes i mean uxie
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay two sets for your two rngs then or three if youd trade me that rng terrakion too p natures should be fine ill be going now but i can start working tomorrow
pokemontrades,not_removed,i think sets is enough p both have photo proof and were obtained via rng abuse with the use of an emulator and lua scripts i would like proof on the meowth set like abutton with the proof on the paper to say redeem date language in the set and from xamarqand to expiredjellybean something like languages english japanese korean spanish french german and italian for the first set i would like the dates to be january and the second set february natures for the meowth can be jolly adamant hasty and naive the rngs are in gen and i would prefer meowths to be as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,will do the date means that ill have to change my ds date right it wont mess up the daily events i assume if that is the case then everything should be good i should be ready at the end of the week maybe earlier ill tell you when im halfway through
pokemontrades,not_removed,cool and yes by the date i mean change the ds date it shouldnt mess up the daily events if you change the date back iirc
pokemontrades,not_removed,great great great see you again later
pokemontrades,not_removed,ive started the sets now two meowth done and twelve to go i believe i could be ready tomorrow night gmt even today if im lucky with the natures and something doesnt come up
pokemontrades,not_removed,nice
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey a question do you have any spare bps wondering if you could teach the kyurem earth power and the uxie stealth rock foul play trick knock off obviously only if you have extra bps and youre willing to use them no worries if not if youre willing to use a few but not enough for all of those then id choose earth power stealth rock
pokemontrades,not_removed,i havent completed oras and dont have access to the nice tutor
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright well i suppose well be getting them in the second installations of gen so im not too worried d first set is ready soon starting the seventh meowth in around minutes
pokemontrades,not_removed,the rngs will be traded in gen so you can always tutor in your own time
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i remembered that after i wrote my message i havent gone through the game completely either just to get soaring but i will be doing it as i need to catch comp ray deoxys might as well collect bp from my bank on the gen cart and use it there
pokemontrades,not_removed,first set ready

pokemontrades,not_removed,i wanted a dog this year in my apartment complex that clearly stated dogs were not allowed i ended up doing a lot of research and found out i could get a dog on the grounds of it being an emotional support animal which cant legally be denied in any residence to get this dog i needed to get a letter from a psychiatrist though so i went to a psychiatrist and got this letter and continued to call the office in charge of my building the lady on the phone blatantly told me that it wasnt a thing and that dogs were never allowed i then followed her comments by shaming her intolerance for the mentally ill threatening her with legal involvement and demanding to speak to someone else in charge frankly she was shocked by my words some vulgar and eventually just let me get a dog realistically i didnt need the dog for emotional support and i still dont think she knows what an emotional support animal is but i got what i wanted and now i have a retired racing greyhound number
pokemontrades,not_removed,in highschool i took an unlocked bike i found lying near a golf course and just used it to get across town quicker just ditched it when i was done still feel bad
pokemontrades,not_removed,story i used to be a regular on this particular server of a game i played once this guy whom annoyed everyone and was generally very obnoxious and rude applied to be a mod to decrease his chances of being a mod and therefore getting banmutesilence powers that he would definitely abuse i applied as well mod applications were open and were public so we could all see when someone applied after seeing my app he started messaging me asking me why i didnt wait and that it was rude of me to apply at the same time period he did in the end we were both accepted however after two days of him constantly abusing the power i had collected enough screenshots of it and reported him to the owner not only did his statuspowers get stripped he got banned from all servers the owner had and not just on that particular game either he tried to contact me and my thenso via our steam profiles but we mostly just ignored him i stayed a mod for a couple months and then was promoted to admin where i stayed for a couple years until i eventually resigned and quit the game i dont regret what i did one bit he deserved it number

pokemontrades,not_removed,when i was a kid i played dingdongditch on my neighbor however it turns out that my neighbor was taking a nap while he was cooking chicken in the oven and his kitchen caught on fire the bell woke him up and he used the fire extinguisher to put out the flames thankfully my number is

pokemontrades,not_removed,ive been playing pokemon since the beginning and when my little siblings were old enough to get into it they did ive shamefully done the eldest privilege borrow and forget to return many times when it came to cartridges my number is because mew is the bestest cutest pokemon evers
pokemontrades,not_removed,so this one time i was browsing this forum that i would visit pretty frequently and one of the users was holding a contest now the rules and criteria of the contest were pretty clear but i realized i wasnt going to be able to meet them because i didnt have any relevant stories i thought about going on facebook and asking my friends if they had any applicable experiences i considered just picking one of the best ones and then using that as my own after a bit of thought i realized that would be pretty lame even if it was in the spirit of the contest what i ended up doing was posting a short story that was really just a waste of their time in hopes that i would still win a prize what a jerk right
pokemontrades,not_removed,breh i am so afraid about the histories that you may have
pokemontrades,not_removed,in high school i was normally the one to put the most effort into group projects for a group history finally i only ended up doing my part of the project even though others expected more i turned in my portion and said fuck it i threw my other classmates under the bus let the teacher know they didnt do shit i got my a they go their f edit number
pokemontrades,not_removed,when i younger and still trickotreeted a bunch of friends and i tried to jump a fence but we ended up knocking a section of it over we were laughing super hard and the old lady that answered the door gave us extra candy because she thought we seemed like nice kids having a great time
pokemontrades,not_removed,i choose wow this can get pretty dark ill pick a personal story that is not totally unpleasant lol i use to play everquest online adventures for there was a sword that everyone wanted because it looks like clouds buster sword and it was very strong however there was another sword that looked like it but had terrible stats now this was before the days of wow and there wasnt all these fancy auction house contraptions or seeing the name of the item in the trade window shmubeldeegook if you wanted to sell stuff at good prices you had to go to freeport where everyone traded and yell it out one day this devilish fellow convinced me to join his scam house auctioncasino i sold the fake buster sword for a million tunare which was a lot and immediately logged out i sat in my chair and started feeling sooo guilty i felt so bad i couldnt handle it not much later i logged back in to try to apologize and give the money back but i couldnt find him i felt terrible i left the scam house and never scammed again but hey still had a million extra buckeroonis
pokemontrades,not_removed,originally i was a quiet kid who liked to read a lot however i had a really bad childhood i was picked on a lot especially in middle school for not having clothes that fit right too small and being dirtyfull of holes when i got into high school i was tired of being bullied my whole life and proceeded to go absolutely nuts and beat down every single kid who bullied other people in the school after that i became a delinquent and local gang leader but the school was very orderly and all the teachers and principals let me do whatever i wanted since i was polite to them number please
pokemontrades,not_removed,well one time i was being bullied by a kid while i was in private school he was kicking me in the knee and i was wearing a steel walking cast because i broke my ankle for the ten gazillion time it ended where i defended myself by kicking him with a steel boot in the knee and the teachers walked in conveniently only to see me kicking him i got in trouble and not him but ill never regret kicking him as he bullied me for months before that
pokemontrades,not_removed,wow nice contest ill choose and the time when something happened and i did something wrong and it worked in my favor actually happened today memorial day at my work and they asked me to stay late but i told them i cant and my brother said yes got off at the normal hour mark and hes still there working pulling a hour shift
pokemontrades,not_removed,once upon a time high school is a place in which everyone is there to simply make friends and get out one kid does not have any friends and as such i took that as an opportunity to be his friend he is grateful and very naive but he is in the class and seems like he needs a friend being overtly nice only lead to him trying to cheat off of me on homeworkquizzes and such this lead to me questioning his grades and as such i simply stopped talking to him as he was also quite the mean and judgemental person next semester comes around his ranking dropped places and he still tries to copy off of me and is still a judgemental jerk overall moral of the story sometimes they have no friends for a reason also
pokemontrades,not_removed,went home one night with a girl that one of my friends had been grafting for a while ended up being my girlfriend of years following that random number thanks for the giveaway

pokemontrades,not_removed,i take advantage of my friends being too nice ignorin some rather bad habits of mine if that counts i dont think i did any hw for ap spanish this year because my class was scheduled right after a sort of minute break period we have at school i just do my homework while theyre beside me either discussing answers or preparing for class because they procrastinate as well but end up actually doing it during the break in the same vein i love doing my chem homework minutes before class by asking a friend to explain a problem to me he calls me out sometimes but explains it anyway because hes too nice xd random is
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for the contest and my story goes back to the hellish days of elementary school to begin i used to rode the bus to and from school everyday and on the school buses where i live everyone believed that the back of the bus was where the cool kids sat and that you were cool if you sat there around this time paper wasps became popular for those who dont know paper wasps are incredibly folded up pieces of paper that you shoot with a rubber band they generally left bruises i sat in the back with the older kids and one day i got sick of them and used the paper hornets as aneeded excuse to get them in trouble they did and were stuck riding in the front for the rest of the school year so my friends and i got the back
pokemontrades,not_removed,there was a bully that would always pick on the smaller kids in the football teamamerican footballso i decided to stand up for them and shoved him—i became the bully he ended up apologizing to themno more problems for the rest of the school year number
pokemontrades,not_removed,thought about this one for a little while so i was at university a couple of years ago on our course at the time did a module which was suitably needless to our studies yet compulsory we didnt mind as it didnt really impact any of our other modules until one day during the crunch period of that year the lecturer attempted to make us all do a heavily demanding unmarked group presentation everyone grizzled but was prepared to knuckle under i however had had enough i sent the lecturer an email explaining how his assignment was effectively pointless and a waste of our time in the period of intense pressure that we were currently in i was tactful in my wording of this email but certainly forthright in my opinion sent the email hoped he understood went in the next day fair to say he hadnt taken the email well he was extremely argumentative about how people has resisted his assignment i prepared to bear the brunt of it facetofacebut he kept referring to one student in particular one student who was absent at the time the lecturer kept saying about how he had voiced his opinion very strongly and the lecturer blamed him entirely for the problem tldr the lecturer was completely unaware that i had sent the aggressive email and in fact thought that somebody absent had sent the email instead and blamed them almost entirely did i correct himno did anyone have to do that presentationalso no random number darkrais being a pain in the backside to sr right now so lets hope his number brings me luck in other ways please
pokemontrades,not_removed,i will take cause it is obviously coolest number well there is actually too much of it i kinda failed as human being top example would be when i was really depressed few years ago and scared my whole family and everyone by running from home and chatting with my exgf about my suicidal thoughts they send police for me and locked me into hospital for week where is the happy end i actually managed to see my exgf and i got way better after like year just because this happened for which i will hate myself for really long time i suppose

pokemontrades,not_removed,this happened about months ago sometime after i met my current friend group we were all planning a party and we decided that they would provide the money for alcohol at the party and i would do other things like provide food and stuff like that so i was going to go buy it with my card and they would pay me back since i had spare money and it would be easier if i bought everything and they paid me back so i head to the liquor store with my friend and we are deciding what to buy since it is a big party and we want quantity and not quality we get some bottom shelf whiskey and vodka after we pick what we want i give my card to my friend while i look around to see if we needed anything else i figured we were good and the purchase went smoothly so we are about to drive away when he looks at the receipt and notices we only got charged for out of the bottles we were crazy excited about that and decided to leave while we were ahead didnt tell me friends though so they paid like dollars for dollars of liquor and i pocketed the difference oh and i kept the dollar tip that they were supposed to pay my friend for helping out with setup and getting the alcohol he forgot and i told them i paid it so made a nice profit off of it we are all super close now and i would never cheat them like that now though my number is for luxray

pokemontrades,not_removed,to start off a little backstory to it all ive got a chronic disease which in the end of my schooldays caused me to miss around of my classes in my college the last option i had to finish my classes was to go to a school for disabled in that school the students start off in small groups to support each other better and they have to take a psych test to see what kind of mental support is best for the person the teachers themselves are allowed to make notes themselves along the side of the test from several talks turns out some teachers suspected me of having autism which ive been tested on before nbsp so then started my year long fraud i had no interest in getting special attention from teachers while i do not need it so i had to show im perfectly capable of making friends and social contact for starters unfortunately in my group there were only students aside from me and out of those three i picked the most social one of the group and joined her for a smoke break outside she was the one smoking it would probably instantly kill me i was standing a bit away in the wind so it wouldnt reach me remember best of the three nbsp so over the entire year even though we mostly were in different classes i hung out with her a lot but only while we were at that school nothing in private aside from social media in case classes were cancelled or such meanwhile i already analysed her and her behaviour she had started to like me and get a crush on me while i already made clear plenty times that i am in a relationship still not a big deal i suppose i noticed she never followed through with promises and obsessed over what others think of her more than normal sort of contradicting but whatever to be nice i invited her over several times she never came of course she came to be really clingy and trusted me more than anyone for some reason i honestly did not do anything special to invoke her to trust me that much nbsp now at the end of my schoolyear she dropped out twice from a burnout and since the school was below my regular level i finished over a year before her i suddenly dropped contact with her and blocked her from any form of media i had her on i admit that its not a nice or good thing to do but she no longer was of any use to me i used her for her presence and the image of having a friend in that school while in reality i simply have no interest befriending liars with a relatively bad reputation turns out friends of hers came to that school as well and rumours easily started that she never really was faithful to anyone she dated of course i did make other friends in the class i was in i just needed her for the first few weeks did i do a bad thing yes but i do not regret it i did give her genuine advice on her personal problems which she immediately ignored for whatever reason her choice and i got a peaceful year without much special care which in the end mightve helped other students more nbsp tldr i friended some weird girl at one of my schools for the sake of not being bothered by people and teachers for being antisocial then cut off any form of contact i had with her without a word as soon as i graduated nbsp i would like to have number
pokemontrades,not_removed,there was this one timeit is quite recent actually that we had a pop quiz in chemistryi had studied quite a lot of time and was really confident about this testthen a friend of mine who hadnt studied at all wanted me to help himhappens every timebut i saidinside that is enough and i will not help himso the whole test was rightwrong questionsso i told him the opposite answers of what i putunfortunately i was wrong in half of them so we ended up getting the same grade and he even thanked me for passingwell i guess that worked out for him better than me doesnt love sylveon

pokemontrades,not_removed,quit my job leaving the place high dry this place was far behind industry standards and i was a product test technician typically that means running very basic routines as detailed by an engineer the scope of what i actually did falls more under the umbrella of test engineer as i was designing fabricating wiring and programming test devices of my own design because the engineers were all sub par employees this would have been fine i love stress and challenges but they were paying me middle of the road pay for a technical level tester which normally would entail just pressing a button the owner seemed flabbergasted that i would want more pay he had no concept of what my value was being able to wire electrical and do programming and automated testing automated data collection so after many years i decided they were too far gone and i would never be compensated properly and i moved on to a much better paying position at a new place i feel bad because i really wanted to improve and change the place but when the managers and owners are that blind theres only so much you can do pushing from the bottom
pokemontrades,not_removed,my story happened in gta v my friend and i had just join a lobby we were driving round having fun blowing up stuff typical gta but little did we know the lobby was actually hackedmy friend and i were chatting away and suddenly a million bounty was put on his head we then both saw this and panicked he screamed at me to help him get home where to could wait an hour and get the bounty himself so naturally i pulled out my sawed off shotgun and pulled the trigger he was less than pleased number bidoof
pokemontrades,not_removed,this one is childish haha me and my brother were around and years old we had one game cube controller and so wed have to share if both of us wanted to play we each also had two game boy advances and pokemon leafgreen and firered one day im playing and my little brother comes and says he wants to play five more minutes its been five minutes my turn so i let him use it after a while though he wanted to continue to play i came up with an idea i pretended i was going to go play my game boy advance he had misplaced his earlier but secretly hid mine game cartridge inside in one of his drawers underneath some clothes i waited a while then mooom i cant find my gameboy can you help me find it please we search the house i conveniently find it in my brothers roomwhen my moms in there i grin as my mom goes down the stairs and tells him to stop playing and go to his room my brother tries to tell her that he didnt take it but as the oldest and since my mom was there when i found it he got grounded for the rest of the day once he was up in his room i felt bad but those feelings were soon forgotten after i started playing sonic adventure battle and began kicking robot butt and playing with the cute chao to be fair he did get me in trouble by hitting himself and telling my parents i hit him
pokemontrades,not_removed,number as a kid i used to convince other kids into buying pokemon stickers and saying how expensive they are i used to buy a sticker for dollars and sell each sticker for a dollar xd well i made good money
pokemontrades,not_removed,with my friends killed and ate more than people was fun and delicious got away with it though since good ol steven pointed the finger at the velociraptors please
pokemontrades,not_removed,random number i once told my mom i was only hanging out with one friend at her house but we then hung out with others and went to get lunch and had a bunch of fun not too bad but still was against what my mom thought i was doing
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey umerryfellows is there any chance that you picked the winners already not to be rude or anything just checking ヽ゜∇゜ノ
pokemontrades,not_removed,my freshman year in high school i let one of the jocks copy my answers on a spanish test when the teacher handed out the scores i got a and the other guy filled out the scantron incorrectly and had to retake the test lololol here comes dat boi o shit waddup
pokemontrades,not_removed,called someone out on their bs as a result they stopped doing it d idk if that counts but whatever lol as for the number
pokemontrades,not_removed,look im not trying to single you out im sorry if it comes off like that i dont know you you might actually have something that requires one and you just decided you wanted to get one im just scared because this is the top comment and im worried people will think liying about a esa is ok its not ok lying about your pet being an emotional supportservice animal will hurt those who actually need them it may not seem like it hurts anything to lie about esa at the moment but it will reach a point where stricter regulations are put in place that will make it harder for people who already have it hard people who truly need these animals would trade the ability to bypass ruleslaws to be a normal person they do not want the esa or service animal they need them to do things normal people take for granted i have a disability called cone dystrophy and i may need a service dog in the future when i see people bragging about breaking the law to get their dog in places they shouldnt be it makes me not want to get one it makes me fear people will think im lying because my disability isnt noticeable at first glance
pokemontrades,not_removed,lmao this ones my favorite
pokemontrades,not_removed,who knows maybe she is reading this now
pokemontrades,not_removed,i just wonder how you got the letter if you dont need a support dog you actually screwed your psychiatrist over more than that lady on the phone because to be fair she is very much in the wrong with this but your psychiatrist could lose his job if he wrote a letter for no reason though that would be his own fault on the other hand
pokemontrades,not_removed,love it lol

pokemontrades,not_removed,hello i had a long day yesterdaytoday so i am currently reading the last entries will be announcing winners this evening
pokemontrades,not_removed,i would like to clarify however that esas and service dogs are not the same thing an esa can be any animal without any training whatsoever in addition laws do not allow esas in places like restaurants theaters etc having esa certification mainly allows you to waive a no pets policy in housing i agree that there are people that still definitely need this service but it is not like i am bringing my dog into all these public places and telling them they cant make me leave really it is only ever brought up with my landlord that being said a trained service dog could also act as an esa i am sure some people do try to pull the esa card in public places when they dont know the limitations of actual esa rights or just dont care and abuse them i dont think the restrictions on esas specifically will change anytime soon for example those suffering from anxietydepression can get esas if it calms them down and that is a large percentage of the population if anything more landlords should be aware of esas i could have just let mine shut me down when i brought it up someone who needed an esa could have been shut down and discouraged that is more of an issue to me in all honesty because she was straight up rude to me when i brought it up in addition the amount of businesses that allow people to manipulate the law because they dont know anything about esas is an issue eg my yorkie is an esa and needs to sit at the table with us and i know we are discussing things a little bit differently as it seems i might be more so addressing mental health while you physical disability but in general the amount of prescribed medication for mental health right now is absurd the fact that anyone can go in for a minute session and leave with a mental health prescription seems ridiculous that is the reality of our mental health landscape though currently and esas fall into the category there is a larger issue than people lying which is the lack of honest diagnosis by many doctors i am actually quite knowledgable about this topic and trust me i dont go around and brag about my dog lol i only brought it up because it fit this thread
pokemontrades,not_removed,i mention it in my longer post abovetbh the amount of vetting psychiatristsdoctors do is pretty sad and could almost be considered malpractice imo whole system needs to be updated if you can get an anxietydepression diagnosis you can get an esa us is very happy to throw meds and diagnosis everywhere recently
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeahhh i got mine stolen a few years ago so it definitely came full circle
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh wow tyvm

pokemontrades,not_removed,oh sure no worries youre giving free stuff the least we could do to help is wait
pokemontrades,not_removed,please tell me i am one of them xd dont push yourself thoughbecause this giveaway is awesome
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey just wondering if you have given the aegislash and pco pika
pokemontrades,not_removed,i know i am aware they are not the same thing and dont have the same privalages i also know its not a current issue but it could be one in the future if enough people start lying it could create problems i wasnt judging you like i said i dont know you i was just worried people would see your comment on this thread and think they could lie about their dog being an esa or service animal because they simply want privileges and think that its ok and doesnt hurt anyone esa are also abused like service dogs like you said there are mental health professionals who seem to write a note after one session people mainly do it to get their pet on a plane though and that is my main concern about it i very much agree that more people should be more aware of esa and service animals its horrible people try to deny service to those who need them because they dont know anything about them my knowledge of them only came from a public speaking course our teacher had us choose one main topic to discuss for the entire course and mine was on service dogs while a classmate chose esa i believe a ptsd service dog doubles as a esa i think mostly retired people from the army have them and they help them intergrate back into society by making them feel safe my main interest is in a seeing eye dog so i honestly dont remember that much about the other types of service animals i just know they have to provide a physical service to be considered a service animal
pokemontrades,not_removed,youre sadly more than right there im not a us citizen but that problem is pretty much everywhere in some cases they dont even do checkups on the cases so just enjoy the dog and everything that comes with it

pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,ill be free to trade in a couple hours perhaps in around hours and i can offer you a moon ball lapras for trade in exchange for a heavy ball lapras also when you complete your lapras collection can you please pm me so that we can set up a trade here on this sub so i can also get a complete lapras collection from you ive got over breedable pokémon to offer in exchange for lapras in other pokéballs
pokemontrades,not_removed,i know you already have the lapras i have but is there anything youd be interested in my spreadsheet
pokemontrades,not_removed,absolutely let me know when youre free tomorrow when you find out that is so we can set up a time thats good for both of us have a great night
pokemontrades,not_removed,i wont be able to trade then have to rely on mcdonalds wifi sadly ill edit the op to show when i can usually trade and yes i would love to work out a lapras exchange do you want anything from my vulpix as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,is your totodile a colosseum mon
pokemontrades,not_removed,actually id be interested in the complete vulpix set as well ill get to breeding the lapras and have that ready for you i thought i edited the previous comment to include a link to my list but i guess it didnt go through are the pokémon that i can breed standard trade rates apply and dbha female pokémon go for im very busy at the moment and will be for about more weeks so if we set up the complete set trades during those times ill need a bit of time to get the pokémon you want bred therefore in the meantime please look through my list and let me know what pokémon you would like form me so i can get a head start i currently only have moon lapras and dream vulpix and ill get a heavy lapras from you that means ill still have more pokémon to get from you from the complete set trades therefore feel free to list up to pokémon or a smaller number equivalent to that exchange rate from my list i dont need your list any time soon just within the next day or two if possible ill let you know when im free to trade tomorrow im cdt so just an hour behind you and thank you so much hope you have an awesome night
pokemontrades,not_removed,well that took a couple days but at least the lapras trade is done thank you so much and i hope you have a wonderful week
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i got it in a trade just the other day
pokemontrades,not_removed,lure magikarp moon dratini love pichu dream pachirisu sport scyther heavy shellder pachirisu counts as so thats total other than these do you have any colosseumxd starters
pokemontrades,not_removed,you too take care
pokemontrades,not_removed,by the other day i think it was actually yesterday xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,id be interested in that what were you looking for
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont have any colluseumxd starters unfortunately tbh i dont really know whats so special about them what is it thats different about those starters other than the fact that they originate from colluseumxd also im getting friend vulpix from someone else so its a total of now but thats still plenty d ill get started on these as soon as im through the rest of my breed queue but your moon lapras is at the top of that queue haha
pokemontrades,not_removed,would you be willing to do a trade if so then im interested in dream buneary friend aipom and love vulpix also it will take me a while to breed your pokemon due to gender ratios
pokemontrades,not_removed,theyre the only way to get certain starters in any balls other than poke event balls so shop balls like dive repeat etc
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i can do that for a starter no prob
pokemontrades,not_removed,huh but you can get those through friend safari in xy right like nest dive luxury etc at least thats what i assumed however i do have some shop ball starters which i assumed were from friend safari i received them through trades here so theyre legit of course feel free to look through that list through the shop balls and you should see some of those nest bulbasaur repeat cyndaquil dive totodile etc edit just looked up the friend safari pokémon and i see what you mean you can only get the gen i and vi starter pokémon in shop balls through those means the other gen pokémon are all colluseumxd exclusives in that case i do have some of those then
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok ill let you know when your pokemon is ready
pokemontrades,not_removed,after about males your female has finally hatched ill add you now

pokemontrades,not_removed,thats not a problem just figured i might offer since some of your other comments have heavily implied that the one game in your flair is not the only one you have and i thought perhaps youd want an extra code to be redeemed in another game even if the other offer for a code went through thanks anyway and good luck
pokemontrades,not_removed,i got my darkrai now but if you have a manaphy ill give you a diancie i obtained it myself
pokemontrades,not_removed,do i post pictures of the wondercard or is there another way to prove it

pokemontrades,not_removed,hi im interested in your dbha spinda nincada electrike wailmer shellos east and dwebble please let me know if anything here interests you
pokemontrades,not_removed,is there anything youd be interested in my spreadsheet
pokemontrades,not_removed,i can breed you a poliwag dbha or something else from spreadsheet for gligar dbha
pokemontrades,not_removed,i am interested in a dbha kabuto and aerodactyl let me know if there is anything you would take for these
pokemontrades,not_removed,would a fast ball elekid jolly static w ice and fire punch catch your interest
pokemontrades,not_removed,pachirisu ponyta lapras shuckle buneary anorith riolu smeargle spiritomb aerodactyl ralts and chinchau durant and starly if you have any issues or simply dont need to lease out any of these pokemon let me know
pokemontrades,not_removed,yo it looks like your bankball collection is improving p i dont have breeding time but i do have quite a few bankballs in my stock i already have a complete bankball collection and i dont think you had shop balls i want so at the moment im mainly interested in swapping my stock to expand my selection or possibly trade for perfect bankball parents you dont list things you have onhand and i have a hard time accessing the template of spreadsheet you use goes really slow no idea why so i dont know exactly how much i have onhand that you are interested in although if youd be interested in a swap for stock things or maybe for perfect parents negotiable i have no real preference in what i get other than avoiding duplicates tldr want to swap your stock with my stock
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey just wondering if you still need a dbha wingull and numel
pokemontrades,not_removed,hiya id be interested in fast ball abra love ball abra love ball swablu im not interested in db without their ha where possible and shop balls atm
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry i have dbha poliwag and moonball munchlax they might not be listed on bankballs as im still updating thank you for taking the time to look through it all though
pokemontrades,not_removed,id be interested in heavy ball geodude lure psyduck heavy larvitar love koffing sport paras
pokemontrades,not_removed,id be interested in your dbha natu plusle larvitar trapinch snorlax basculin blue basculin red as i really want all im willing to breed you one more of anything i have id be interested in some of your bank balls at another time
pokemontrades,not_removed,id be interested in love spoink heavy ralts
pokemontrades,not_removed,i already have poliwag dbha unfortunately its not listed in the bankballs tab unfortunately theres nothing else im interested in at the moment but if youre looking to grow your collection i do lease out my pokemon
pokemontrades,not_removed,kabuto and aerodactyl arent on my breeding list also i i believe i have all of the pokemon in your spreadsheet sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry i already have a fast jolly elekid wstatic
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have a female magby for you if youre still interested
pokemontrades,not_removed,these are dbha right let me just check them
pokemontrades,not_removed,haha hey pip id love to do some trades with you in my bankballs and new tabs because one tab is becoming too much for all of them and shop balls tab i have a qty column for male and female anything that has a number in the female column is what i have onhand at the moment id be interested when ive done this massive list to do some perfect parent trades on some of my mons if there are any that catch your fancy and are already reasonably close to being perfect at the moment im painfully close to completing my dbha collection for immediate trading id be interested in a dbha remoraid from that list
pokemontrades,not_removed,i do
pokemontrades,not_removed,im finding myself in a slew of orders so ill get to you in a bit
pokemontrades,not_removed,im sorry but do you want your love ball abra to have its ha you did not specify
pokemontrades,not_removed,jesus fuck go hard honedge
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure i also have quite a few dbha that you are missing would you be interested in dbha elekid dbha magby dbha illumise dbha slugma dbha machop and i can offer you better males for some of your mons if you want ems let me know if that interests you i have more that you are missing but i dont want to do like a massive trade lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,f you can throw in a dbha snubbul then id love to do this trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,would you be willing to trade for dbha chatot and magikarp
pokemontrades,not_removed,well yes i would love to increase my collection so im trying to go for demanded ones like dratini have and gligar which many want to get more of the rare and difficult ones if you could lease out a gligar or something i dont have i can repay with lansat berry big nugget or evolutionary stone as courtesy for it
pokemontrades,not_removed,would a fast ball elekid jolly static w ice and fire punch catch your interest safari ball phanpy adamant pick up play rough body slam head smash ice shard
pokemontrades,not_removed,hell yea sry i think we in difftime zones but im super interested ty for not forgetting me so ill stalk you until i see you again lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,yup those are dbha and oh you were referring to the bulbasaur you gave me thanks for the bulbasaur
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh my gosh i got a shiny gligar from that and didnt even noticed since it was from your gligar would you like me to give it to you
pokemontrades,not_removed,im not sure if your breeding jobs require specific natures ivs or moves but you could outsource some of the breeding you need to do for my onhands i noticed absol and a couple others i have onhand and could save you some time as far as trading i really have no preference if they arent perfect and we can work out those deals at a later time so id be interested in any old dbha or apricorns you have onhand
pokemontrades,not_removed,let me trade you both you can give me any breedject in return
pokemontrades,not_removed,no worries
pokemontrades,not_removed,no because thats an illegal combination
pokemontrades,not_removed,im not interested in shop balls right now
pokemontrades,not_removed,i believe i only need dbha slugma from those my bankballs tab is somewhat outdated but the rest are marked off in breedaballsi am breeding them in this list
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure i actually have snubbull on hand so that is easy
pokemontrades,not_removed,i believe i have both of those already
pokemontrades,not_removed,i can lease you the gligar all i ask is that i get the original and a new copy back it is already ha and has would it be okay that as payment i just ask you to breed the nature as careful
pokemontrades,not_removed,i already have a safari ball phanpy trade pending what i could suggest is if you like youre welcome to borrow any of my pokemon you like as long as you improve one or more of the emsnatureivs and give me the original back along with an improved one would that work out better for you
pokemontrades,not_removed,im around now just let me know
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh gosh no grats you did all the breeding and it was your number that hatched it here are the details about the dbha you listed pachirisu ponyta aerodactyl durant and starly doesnt seem to need anything but ill need to check the ivs and see if they need improving lapras needs modest nature and freezedry i have other lapras with freezedry if you need a pokemon with it shuckle needs bold and em buneary needs jolly and em ice punch fake out switcheroo fire punch anorith needs em rapid spin knock off aqua jet random whichever is easiest riolu jolly and em bullet punch high jump kick blaze kick random smeargle needs timid spiritomb needs adamantbold and em any ralts needs em any chinchou needs modestbold
pokemontrades,not_removed,that would be a big help actually i have a few additional ones on hand but is there anything on my spreadsheet youd be interested in first edit they do not need specific natures or ems
pokemontrades,not_removed,you sure you dont want anything specific i could breed you some bank balls or something
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey my time finally freed up a bit are you still interested ill make the orders nevertheless but lmk if you are still up for trading the aforementioned pokémon
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh and im going with the regular bb rates so it will be will that be ok with you feel free to check out my finally done spreadsheet to see your trade requests and the rates i put out literally the default ones
pokemontrades,not_removed,utearadio are you still interested
pokemontrades,not_removed,dude i just saw this and im actually so sorry it seems that this abra i have means i got a hacked mon i looked it up and yes love ball ha abra is illegal i did not know about this im taking him off my list and this trade and releasing him can i compensate you for this i can give you a free to apologize
pokemontrades,not_removed,mhmm okay are there are any ones that you are missing and you know you need thats a weird question but yeah both of our stock is outdated so this is rough i do have dbha zigzagoon dbha zangoose dbha snover dbha tangela and dbha exeggcute anyways i want from you the following dbha durant dbha audino dbha drifloon dbha shellos east dbha seviper dbha minun dbha chinchou and dbha misdreavus dont think that equals out but just lmk if you need any of the ones i just listed and ill fix it accordingly
pokemontrades,not_removed,cool i have to breed all its gonna take a while but gonna do it as quickly as i can
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes and you wanted love spoink and heavy ralts
pokemontrades,not_removed,i can do that itll probably take minutes to an hour to get one as careful
pokemontrades,not_removed,adding you
pokemontrades,not_removed,tea ive never done that before i boost the iv of your poke and i can keep and a breedject for myself
pokemontrades,not_removed,online now lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,you are amazing
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright ill start with whatever is easiest mostly natures and work my way up to natures and em i might be able to finish it all by tomorrow if not ill just tell you what i have by then going to trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,ralts is done buneary next up
pokemontrades,not_removed,feel like drop kicking myself ee some of those egg moves can be tutored for and after all that time searching for fire punch
pokemontrades,not_removed,buneary is done
pokemontrades,not_removed,starly ponyta and pachirisu are done
pokemontrades,not_removed,nope surprise me em apricorns are most likely to be of use to me but the goal of this is to have more types of things so i can make better deals in the future and help people that actually need my mons i make odd deals sometimes but its thought out p
pokemontrades,not_removed,aww not really if you have any love ball on hand tho i have a thing for pink pokeballs
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure and the regular rates are fine which were you after in return for the above and the premier ball combee
pokemontrades,not_removed,its no biggy if it helps any apricorn ball mon wont legally have ha as it wasnt a thing in hgss
pokemontrades,not_removed,my bankball tab is outdated but my breedaballs collection isnt it might be easier to see what i dont have since its all in a column and the blanks are what im missing off the top of my head i am missing shelmet hippopotas mr mime stunky bidoof luvdisc clamperl kecleon barboach spoink numel wurmple delibird remoraid dunsparce and drowzee ill write up the list and get back to you on that
pokemontrades,not_removed,no rush as ill have to go down this list in order etc so it will take a while
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh right duh jesus sorry i clearly am not all there today thats fine ill let you know when they are done
pokemontrades,not_removed,alrighty ill go grab it from the bank then add you
pokemontrades,not_removed,all youve gotta do is pick a pokemon with something that can be improved so like maybe a gligar has and good ivs but the wrong nature if you breed it for the right nature you can keep the new improved version as long as you give me back the mother and an improved version as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,cool ill hop on
pokemontrades,not_removed,haha no worries
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright hang on i need to go grab them as well sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,i also would like something with freezedry to help with the em for lapras
pokemontrades,not_removed,alrighty also do you have instacheck or whatever it is called ive always wondered what my tsv is
pokemontrades,not_removed,ill grab you some
pokemontrades,not_removed,pardon i dont think i quite understand your question none of us asked for a combee
pokemontrades,not_removed,it feels like i scammed you but in all honesty i really did not know and i guess i went along with it im really really sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,gotcha well i have dbha shelmet mime id need to evolve mime jr barboach i might have spoink i have wurmple delibird and dunsparce tell me the ones you want most and we can even it out
pokemontrades,not_removed,i see youre still breeding but just letting you know that theyre ready
pokemontrades,not_removed,lmao thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have come to the realization that my spreadsheet was wrong i do not have a heavy ball female ralts sorry may i still have the chattot for the love spoink
pokemontrades,not_removed,im going to run an errand for minutes from now brb
pokemontrades,not_removed,nidoran f friend ball available for library loan could its naure be improved or ivs the egg moves impress me as is i do have a male with sucker punch and double kick
pokemontrades,not_removed,durant is and needs no improvement starly ponyta and pachirisu are so they would be hard to improve getting the freezedry lapras now let me know if you want to try and improve the
pokemontrades,not_removed,i use keysav but yeah i can do a tsv check just make sure you send me pokes that were made on the file you want checked
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you
pokemontrades,not_removed,which were you after in return for the fast ball abra the love ball abra and love ball swablu in addition to the premier combee from your spreadsheet
pokemontrades,not_removed,no worries honestly it happens a fair bit that people honestly dont realise especially with dbha mons not actually being dbha nobody can realistically check them all all the time im not jaded or anything would it be cool if we took out the alomomola and the snover to cover for the removal of the love abra
pokemontrades,not_removed,would i be able to grab those instead of the bank ball mons of course id still need to equal it out etc
pokemontrades,not_removed,your mons are ready
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure thing
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay let me know
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure i think she needs either a modest or bold nature so either one of those would be great
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright do you know which they are getting is a daunting task but if its just getting a specific then i can do so
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have been blessed by some holy being after boxes dedicated to anorith i came out with swift swim female done with anorith p
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure thing will do i can give you a fair few mons apricorn ems ill just take a more comprehensive peek at your spreadsheet and get back to you
pokemontrades,not_removed,coming online i got you four so ill take two of your breedjects as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,so thats technically pokémon i will ask for dbha f tirtouga dbha f magby dbha f riolu will this be fine
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah thats cool in removing alo and snover thanks for being really chill about this im not keen on being banned for trying to trade a hacked mon when i just got into bankballing
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey this time i got a legal love ball abra although it doesnt have any egg moves yet though would you like it for free of course
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea sure its gonna take me longer but yes
pokemontrades,not_removed,also swap db misdreavus for duskull if you do not mind

pokemontrades,not_removed,sounds good
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you so much ♥ i appreciate it
pokemontrades,not_removed,riolu isnt on the list unfortunately is there anything else youd be interested in
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont think you would be just because you actually didnt know i think its only people who maliciously or knowingly do it the mods are pretty fair and theres a lot to know which can only be done via learning first
pokemontrades,not_removed,im happy to breed the pokemon we originally agreed on for it
pokemontrades,not_removed,if we do the ones you listed you want from me for slugma shelmet mrmime barboach spoink wurmple delibird dunsparce it should be even ive listed it in my breeding queue if you want to have a look

pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for the trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,youre welcome enjoy your larvitar
pokemontrades,not_removed,ive got a lux ha one how many of your listed would you do for it and are they comp at all
pokemontrades,not_removed,ive got one with ha in a luxury ball would u trade ur clamperl for a female one
pokemontrades,not_removed,you mean a shiny in a lux ball otherwise this is super easy
pokemontrades,not_removed,it would seem i had quite a few offers right off the bat to which i would like to close this thread out of good faith i will proceed to dish out shinies to the parties who got in here right out the gate
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello i take it the cresselia is shiny too it seems others have offered what you mentioned looking for is there anything else you might be interested in for her i might also be interested in the salamence too btw are you able to nickname either of them
pokemontrades,not_removed,id be willing to drop two for one unless you wanted the regirockicesteel combo in which case you could have all three and unfortunately no none are competitive they are but results of free time spent over the holidays
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure
pokemontrades,not_removed,nope just a normal in a lux ball
pokemontrades,not_removed,the cresselia is indeed shiny and yes being the one who caught them i should be able to nickname them as well however im unfortunately not looking for anything else at this time but keep an eye out if i find myself in a bind i will be putting them up for trade again
pokemontrades,not_removed,i would take the triostill dont wanna go capture them myself and can go start breeding now bueno
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright adding u now
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh ok i mean your mon are at least a thousand times more valuable than what youre asking for but whatever floats your boat o
pokemontrades,not_removed,well darn thats pretty much the one shiny legendary ive been really looking for oh well cant be helped i guess
pokemontrades,not_removed,bueno
pokemontrades,not_removed,im not terribly attatched to my shinies once i get them i do have a comp red gyarados that im holding on to just because its got the added value of making my friends salty i just love the hunt
pokemontrades,not_removed,saw you got what you needed been breeding for this froakie for the last two hours just stopping by to make sure our trade is still going
pokemontrades,not_removed,yessir just let me know when youve got one and ill hop on
pokemontrades,not_removed,also just in case there was a misinterpreation the froakie im looking for does not have to be shiny so just any old female froakie in a lux ball will do

pokemontrades,not_removed,see above please and thanks again
pokemontrades,not_removed,im really interested in the regen tangela jolly sneasel and the moon ball ralts wsyncro i just dont know which one to pick lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,what are the ivs on that gastly im very interested
pokemontrades,not_removed,i also forgot to mention that the pawniard is in a dream ball and it is female
pokemontrades,not_removed,how about some iv whismurs i have on hand or maybe some dragon types or starters if you have any particular requests i may be able to fulfill them for the klefki i will have to look
pokemontrades,not_removed,except those arent in my on hand tab p if you really want one i might be able to breed them but itll take a bit
pokemontrades,not_removed,the male is with timid nature moon ball and ems perish song disable clear smog and haze and i can provide a female breedject along with the pentaperfect male so you can always pass the ball to more babies
pokemontrades,not_removed,can you list some of the dragon types also if you dont have any on hand ill take a whismur
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure ill wait just message me back when youre ready
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry i asked that question was completely oblivious to the fact that you said perfect my bad and a female breedject along side it would be amazing
pokemontrades,not_removed,lets see deino axew dratini gible bagon trapinch and druddigon are my baby dragons the whismurs vary i could dig up a rattled ability one if you would like probably male and only iv otherwise i have a small selection of soundproof ivs i totally dig the pawniards as long as they do have high ivs as i said above thanks for breeding them
pokemontrades,not_removed,you have to tell me which one you want before i can breed p
pokemontrades,not_removed,would they be enough for a shiny that you listed or would you like another mon that i offered
pokemontrades,not_removed,if you can a soundproof whismur would be amazing
pokemontrades,not_removed,lol sorry about that ill take a jolly sneasel
pokemontrades,not_removed,since you offered to give a second one ill take just one plus that breedject female
pokemontrades,not_removed,why absolutely i can would you like male or female and which iv is ok not maxxed assuming all others are oh and nickname

pokemontrades,not_removed,just bred my httpimgurcomaxybby with masudashinycharm for any pokemon game ive ever played fan since goldsilv d had to ensure it was in an apricorn ball otherwise itd be mistaken for the sixteen quadrillion free shiny haxoruses migrated over from that was given out like damn candy really disliked that aspect of postgame
pokemontrades,not_removed,til you can see the poké ball type of a pokémon in gen gts as opposed to gen gts
pokemontrades,not_removed,any news for the exact date pokebank will be compatible with sun and moon
pokemontrades,not_removed,happy new year everyone
pokemontrades,not_removed,
pokemontrades,not_removed,has anyone of you gotten a pokemon you wondertraded back via wondertrade
pokemontrades,not_removed,what would be a shiny typenull worth currently sring one on my secondary game i bought moon as well and maybe doing more also what nature should i go with currently doing jolly dont know if thats a popular one
pokemontrades,not_removed,just hatched this httpimgurcomyvowpmy my first self bred and hatched shiny pokemon bred with a ger ditto and my eng perfect adamant moon ball male jangmoo no charms pure luck happy new year with a lucky dragon
pokemontrades,not_removed,so i did the reset rng bs wasted hours plus and get the wrong seed the inner me tell myself not to give up so i try another method using homebrew to decrypt save file and extract the seed used under half an hour to read the instructions a couple of minutes to try and it is done so to anyone who would like to rng the eggs dont do the bs reset homebrew saved my ass and if you hate external tool head to rsvexchange
pokemontrades,not_removed,trying to get a celesteela with good nature any advice
pokemontrades,not_removed,qotd resolutions mine dfhg finish all the projects
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi im relatively new to pokemon as is my daughter we both have a copy of sun yesterday i showed her how too wondertrade her second trade she got a pokemon that she doesnt own but it didnt register on her dex called solosis can anybody enlighten me as to why that might happen ive done a small bit of googling and cant find any info on where i can get one
pokemontrades,not_removed,ahhh that explains it thank you very much thats something i havent bothered using yet
pokemontrades,not_removed,little bit of background for this question i heard someone saying a while ago that lucario seem to be unusually prized on the gts so i figured id investigate the phenomenon bred up about a dozen heavy ball riolu with their hidden ability and some egg moves evolved them into lucario got them to about level and stuck one into the gts requesting a type null and thinking itd just sit there for a few days until i took it out hours later i have three lucario left and am now the proud but highly confused owner of seven type nulls that arent mine and two celesteela am i missing something here why are people willing to trade their unbreedable pokemon especially the oneofakind type null for lucario i mean sure they have heavy balls but thats breedable and ubs type nulls arent im confused and wondering if im missing something
pokemontrades,not_removed,happy new year rpokemontrades hope i can contribute to a lot of trades in this community the following year hehe last two questions of the year whats the worth of beast ball pokémon i suppose the better or rarer a pokémon the more beast ball breeders have of them like riolu gible dratini they just look so good with beast balls animations especially shiny riolu and dratini but if i were to trade a staryu or grubbin in a beast ball what should i expect from them oddly a female murkrow in a beast ball can somehow get you a lv shiny in the gts but when youre looking for a specific pokémon with a specific ability its a bit difficult is a destiny knot considered a rare item whats it worth i find battle tree boring and my pokémon are always targeted in battle royal so im tired of getting beat up and rematching battle royal lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,can you tell me which hapokémon diddo you have a hart time to catch in sm and the reason i dont want a solution i really like puzzling it out myself i already got a solution for geodude abra ditto
pokemontrades,not_removed,the ha starters available yet
pokemontrades,not_removed,im about to tear my hair out is natural gift still illegal on vanillite going through my entire collection and trying to sort out what is and isnt illegal
pokemontrades,not_removed,another question is there a list somewhere of moves that smeargle can obtain by sketching wild pokemon that part of breeding is still somewhat confusing to me and im not sure if theres a guide somewhere
pokemontrades,not_removed,what would a shiny poliwag be worth i caught one but im not interested in shinies or poliwags
pokemontrades,not_removed,my secret santa gifter still hasnt revealed themselves to me should i be worried
pokemontrades,not_removed,hopefully this wont get buried but is there a way to get those item trade evolution pokemon through gts i figure i could deposit a scyther w metal coat for a scizor but i cant really imagine anyone going for that preferably i dont really want to use up my electrizermetal coatprism scale etc before i breed my pokemon for ivs i just need the dex entries and then im
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi can anybody tell me what the current estimated worth of a na ha bird code set from the spring giveaway be
pokemontrades,not_removed,someone just scammed me in the trade forums how do i go about this
pokemontrades,not_removed,guys i found the best battle music for guzma heres the
pokemontrades,not_removed,happy new year frohes neues jahr bonne année es gfröits nöis
pokemontrades,not_removed,happy 😁 wish you all the best 💙
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi everyone my giveaway is now open again come check it out if you want pokemon that evolve via trading
pokemontrades,not_removed,would anybody know what the best competitive nature for yveltal is i just got one with rash nature and i wonder if i should keep it or keep sring cuz smogon said rash was good
pokemontrades,not_removed,officially in the uk can start asking about pokebank now right p
pokemontrades,not_removed,important question about ball breeding in since nidoran m f are not considered the same species can nidoran m pass down his ball when breeding with nidoran f if not this means apricorn ball ha nidoran is still illegal bank is not updated so if you want to test it you need to hack them
pokemontrades,not_removed,happy new year everyone d im about to start a new thread to help me collect the last few pokemon i need to finish my pokedex in oras im planning to offer events but whats considered a fair trade for event legendaries for
pokemontrades,not_removed,when people want battle ready mons what exactly does that entail presumably they want ivs and nature do they want egg moves evs held items and levels too what if one mon has several viable sets
pokemontrades,not_removed,anyone know the chances of hp fire on tapu lele
pokemontrades,not_removed,how do the pokeballs in our flair work i have conducted several trades with users here in the forum over the last few days but my ball has remained the same i dont mind if it stays this way but curious
pokemontrades,not_removed,no you can have your napal bottle cap serial code and enjoy it d
pokemontrades,not_removed,congrats are you going to use himher competitive
pokemontrades,not_removed,i read on the official japanese site that itd be end of january but i havent seen anywhere post about an exact date yet
pokemontrades,not_removed,give me more hours nah just kidding happy new year
pokemontrades,not_removed,no once gave a rotom fan named blowjobs or something to a wonderlocke runner though
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes actually i wtd tyrunt breedjects from an mm hunt and i got one back when i sent one off xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,jolly timid adamant modest seem good to me
pokemontrades,not_removed,id say any offensive boosting or speed boosting nature basically
pokemontrades,not_removed,a pokemon in an apricorn ball
pokemontrades,not_removed,practically anything defensive as well as modest
pokemontrades,not_removed,celesteela sometimes uses both offensive stats ive seen sets that only use flamethrower and sets that only use heavy slam and since it isnt particularly fast anyway you might want to use a speedlowering nature like relaxed or sassy if you dont know what you want to do with your celesteela yet its a tank youre not going to catch it outspeeding much any time soon anyway alternatively go for a special attacklowering nature since most of the things celesteela will be hitting with its fire move of choice will either have low special defense skarmory or be weak to fire scizor if you know for sure that youre only going to be using one attacking stat then you can specify down to boldcalmmodest for special attacking sets or impishcarefuladamant for physical attacking sets
pokemontrades,not_removed,ive seen some adamantbrave used in vgc as well although the defensive sets are probably still the most common
pokemontrades,not_removed,careful
pokemontrades,not_removed,continue losing weight and getting in shape
pokemontrades,not_removed,nothing i think resolutions dont work and only lead to increased disappointment once you fail them
pokemontrades,not_removed,getting ufroakiedokie to finish our deal ahem
pokemontrades,not_removed,my resolution is to gambarize when i go study japanese later this year and play piano at least one hour each day even if its not convenient get my app in public beta ill let you know in a year if any of that worked out
pokemontrades,not_removed,to actually stick with whatever resolution i make d
pokemontrades,not_removed,im guessing this coming year wont be much different for me than this year basically ill just put half my blood sweat and tears time into doing well in school and the rest into switching from an event collector to a shiny one bettering myself in comp play and drawing probably itll be just a continuation of my life in xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,solosis line is not in the alola dex but duosion stage evolution is found via island scan
pokemontrades,not_removed,sometimes irrational fads arise in large groups of people maybe its just that but thanks for telling me ill have to capitalize on that a bit
pokemontrades,not_removed,you should try it with castform its the same deal ive gotten all the ubs for castform lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,well there are millions of players who have no idea about trading platform outside the game i got around zygardes or even a dozen of ubs and complete my dex just by depositing breedable in apricorn ball
pokemontrades,not_removed,my initial guess is that they could be cloned but thinking about it isnt it much harder to clone in sun and moon with the connection error temporary ban so its probably what the other users said or maybe they got cloned ones from other people i dunno
pokemontrades,not_removed,i know riolu is found dont know if you can catch lucario though if you cant maybe its because people like me hate friendship evolving
pokemontrades,not_removed,destiny knot is the most important item for people here but i dont see a lot of good trades for it because the people who want it dont have anything good to trade because they need a destiny knot and the people who have good things to trade already have the destiny knot imho beast ball pokemon are over valued there are a few pokemon that suit the colours alolan sandshrew but otherwise it is an ugly if unusual ball
pokemontrades,not_removed,well i would value beast ball pokes the same as an aprimonso for me its like breeject for breeject or comp for comp i know a few people that collect every pokemon in every pokemon that is available but most of the people are looking for matching ballsa ball that matches the color of either the normal or the shiny color of the pokemon about the destiny knot i wouldnt say that is considered a rare itemthe reason is that even if it is a little harder to get than in you only need destiny knot and you only have to buy it once these are just my opinions on your questionsoh and happy new year to you too
pokemontrades,not_removed,ha sableye seems the stuff of nightmares
pokemontrades,not_removed,not yet
pokemontrades,not_removed,it seems to be unavailable right now as the only way it can get natural gift is if either geodude graveler golem onix steelix sudowoodo nosepass probopass snorunt or glalie has it in their moveset from gen natural gift was a tm at the time
pokemontrades,not_removed,there is wild smeargle on route lead with the pokemon with the move you want to sketch find a wild smeargle use adrenaline orb on turn the wild smeargles sketch should fail if you are going to sketch a status move use it on turn if its a damaging move use another adrenaline orbreviveany item that wont work to pass the turns and let the wild smeargle use struggle to damage itself and increase the chance of calling for another smeargle if no one is called and it kills itself go back to step when another smeargle is called use the damaging move you want to sketch to finish off the first smeargle so the second smeargle will sketch it send out your own smeargle to sketch that move from the second wild smeargle
pokemontrades,not_removed,pretty much the same as any other tropy shiny not much more than a breed able unless you find a collector
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello we have a plan for the users who havent been tagged in a comment yet by their gifter we have donations to use as gifts for those users since the deadline is tonight we will work on it sometime tomorrow most likely stay tuned
pokemontrades,not_removed,some people will offer trades like an electabuzz with electirizer for another electabuzz hoping that the person trading with them will reciprocate but that seems kind of inconsistent to me so id say youre better off trading for the evolved pokemon electivire in this case directly or doing a tradeback on this subreddit ive noticed that people on the gts seem to be willing to overpay for apricorn ball lucario by a huge amount like ihaveseventypenullsthatarentminebecauseoflucarios levels of trading so im sure you could trade them directly for electivire magmortar and so on
pokemontrades,not_removed,this is not really an answer to your question but it is generally easier to simply make a post in the dtt or to post a trade asking for someone to help you with a bunch of trade backs many people will help you for free or for interesting breeding scraps
pokemontrades,not_removed,i believe the codes have expired so i dont think youre allowed to trade them right now unless youre talking about the birds from those codes that you already have redeemed
pokemontrades,not_removed,use modmail to let the mods know what the situation is provide as much information as you can
pokemontrades,not_removed,no they only pass down ball when breeding with a ditto or breeding with something of the same species unfortunately not egg group
pokemontrades,not_removed,rash is good thanks to dark aura yveltal has very strong darktype stab moves both physical knock off sucker punch and special dark pulse snarl
pokemontrades,not_removed,late january according to japanese official site
pokemontrades,not_removed,battle ready mons are with proper ivsevsnature and the moves that will be using in battlemaybe a good item tooat least that what a is battle ready mon in my eyes well if a mon has more than one viable set it would be better to orderask before the breeding begins to avoid misunderstandings
pokemontrades,not_removed,httppastebincomgnnhxcki if youre curious
pokemontrades,not_removed,youll have to record your completed trades in flairhq and then apply for flair once you qualify more information in httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikiflairhq
pokemontrades,not_removed,ft a bottle cap wvideo proof lf rare event ahhahah xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,hahaha hey its you yeah maybe its a bit lacking in the speed department soll need some ht
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks a lot
pokemontrades,not_removed,nice classic
pokemontrades,not_removed,nice that must have been taken ages to wt all of those
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,great information thanks d
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea its an amazing tank pokemon ive seen so far
pokemontrades,not_removed,i like to think of it as a gentle reminder no need to beat myself up for past digressions
pokemontrades,not_removed,i mean likethis is a daily discussion on irc so i guess this is relevant o
pokemontrades,not_removed,dont forget take vovvy to cool places in japan o
pokemontrades,not_removed,basically same for me xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,you can do it
pokemontrades,not_removed,haha all excellent pursuits wasnt all bad despite all of the hype i also like the idea of switching to a shiny collector
pokemontrades,not_removed,lucarios a fan favourite so theres that i guess and yeah definitely take advantage before pokemon bank comes out i know i plan to p at least im sending off jolly breedjects with their hidden ability and hjk crunch bullet punch blaze kick id feel worse if i was sending away random lucarios whose only special feature is the heavy ball
pokemontrades,not_removed,ooh really good to know thanks for the tipoff i actually have a beast ball castform thatd be less timeintensive than raising lucario
pokemontrades,not_removed,thats a fair point still doesnt explain why people will trade something they cant get another of by themselves for something they could get by themselves though
pokemontrades,not_removed,ive heard its harder to clone in sun and moon but its possible if they are cloned though then they look entirely legal and therefore im personally not complaining
pokemontrades,not_removed,lucario comes as a rare sos call in riolu battles but you cant catch it wild so thatd kinda make sense also poke pelago is your friend for friendship evolutions stick the pokemon you want to evolve into isle avues hot spring put in some poke beans go and do things and check back every few hours to click on your pokemon so they dont get exhausted from the heat before you know it boom theyre ready to evolve
pokemontrades,not_removed,ouch that hurt my beast ball mons feelings really i think they suit shiny pokémon the best but yeah i get what youre saying about destiny knot and fair trades ill resort to farming the battle royal then
pokemontrades,not_removed,why is that
pokemontrades,not_removed,literally let me guess first is rare second it tend to go after carbink who calling it and this ends the chaining
pokemontrades,not_removed,gotcha thanks for the info
pokemontrades,not_removed,ohh ok so most illegal moves are illegal on the basis that they cant be bred onto that pokemon because of egg groups rather than the move cant be foundsketched
pokemontrades,not_removed,hmm ill give both of those a try if push comes to shove ill make a tradeback thread
pokemontrades,not_removed,yikes thats a tall order
pokemontrades,not_removed,and then for synchonizer too huh thanks for the math tho time to start hunting lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks will youve been helpful today sounds tedious recording the trades though maybe ill stay a little grey ball for awhile p
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah for sure lol xd at least i get festival coins now for my wting xddd
pokemontrades,not_removed,apricorn balls were introduced in there they could be fashioned out of the fruit of the apricorn tree were differently colored fruit would yield different balls but thats just about the origin the balls you get have specific advantages when catching pokemon unique to each ball they also all have a unique design and this is were it gets interesting in you can get one and only oneof each apricorn ball love friend heavy moon lure level fast in the game and on this sub people are really into pokemon that have a ball that matches their color scheme so there is a huge trade in pokemon in apricorn balls for once because they are rare and they have a unique color
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah no problem and its basically true sassy careful impish celesteela is quite a versatile pokemon mostly bulky though
pokemontrades,not_removed,not a problem to be fair im taking most of this from smogon and everyone seems to have a different opinion regarding what celesteela should do the only consensus is that its a really versatile glue pokemon honestly you should look into it yourself there are some set ideas aaand now i wish i had a celesteela with the nature to pull off any of those sets then again we are on a subreddit dedicated to pokemon trading
pokemontrades,not_removed,pls i just want my diancies
pokemontrades,not_removed,sign me up as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,haha thanks xd but my main focus pokemon wise will be comp play im thinking ill be breedingtraining in one game and shiny collecting in the other sometimes or just collecting eggs from my comp mons and esv ing them xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,yup ive also found that it can get those hard to get evos
pokemontrades,not_removed,the effort factor and maybe some people just dunno how to get a lucario some of the ubs come in multiples as well or maybe they dont like their appearance xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh thanks i never used that isle avue yet xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,only appears as an sos call from corsola and will immediately try to kill corsola upon being called breaking the chain
pokemontrades,not_removed,got it in one
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah like some egg moves cant be bred without bank at the moment
pokemontrades,not_removed,it is a bit annoying especially if you go for a ev spread far away from breejects or maybe with some egg moves is less time consumingoh and pay attention to the ballmatching balls ftw
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure thing it is a little tedious but as you hint the flair ladder is a completely optional part of the subreddit we encourage use of it but feel free to stay at the gen i poke ball sprite forever if you want
pokemontrades,not_removed,wait festival coins are gen and tyrunt is a bankmon
pokemontrades,not_removed,lol i could trade you a spare celesteela just gotta set up a thread i only have careful and calm tho
pokemontrades,not_removed,comp play is definitely an area where i can improve as well i really want to make sure to participate in as many online competitions as possible but i missed the first one for gen already
pokemontrades,not_removed,good point actually ill need to try that thanks for the idea
pokemontrades,not_removed,true i can imagine some kid that wants a lucario but doesnt know how to evolve riolu trading one of their ultra beasts since they get several although now i feel bad about ripping off hypothetical children for their ultra beasts then again it might be rabid apricorn ball collectaholics who see a heavy ball lucario and throw away their ultra beasts to snatch them up i dont feel so bad about that xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,well heres your excuse to start isle avues also good for hatching eggs when youre not around but yeah boosting friendship for friendship evolutions is the best use ive found for it dump a bunch of poke beans in the crate to speed it up too theyll get exhausted by the heat which i assume stops happiness from rising after a while but checking in and clicking on them every so often prevents it when mohn starts talking about how your pokemon look so relaxed itd be impossible for them to be any more relaxed theyre at max friendship and one levelup will evolve them
pokemontrades,not_removed,sableye do you mean marianie
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes i said at least now i get festival coins when i wt mm breedjects the tyrunt mm hunt was back in my y version sorry for the confusion xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,ill take the careful one if youre willing but i feel like the questions thread is the wrong place to arrange this maybe make a comment in the casual trades stickied thread
pokemontrades,not_removed,basically the whole of i took off from comp play for the most part thanks to before i started that collection my focus was on comp play so im excited to be coming back
pokemontrades,not_removed,i used friend ball deinos to get a and level ditto from the gts obviously hacked but they make breeding easier took a few tries but people love rare balls on rare mons
pokemontrades,not_removed,i do this celesteela is my currency and its got me a fair share of rare ball breedables eg fast ball vulpix love ball exeggcute fast ball carvanha love ball sableye etc sometimes the pokémon may even come with ha and ems what i do is mass breeding fast ball starly and depositing them requesting celesteela which i noticed is fairly popular then wait for an hour or so and check back to retrieve your celesteela finally i look for a pokémon i want and send the ub back to the system most of the offers are in apricorn balls and request celesteela so building your collection through this method is very easy
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh thank you d
pokemontrades,not_removed,they may have mixed up but afaik sableye only appears from carbinks sos calls and it will try to kill it so same case as mareanie but different pokémon
pokemontrades,not_removed,i think he means that sableye only appears as an sos call for carbink and will try to kill it upon being called its the same as mareanie and corsola
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry i meant carbink not corsola
pokemontrades,not_removed,ahh okay i didnt see the now that makes sense
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea sounds good xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,not a problem have fun with your new lucario togekiss raichu blissey crobat whatever else you need that evolves through friendship
pokemontrades,not_removed,lol yeah xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks xd ironically enough i actually just friendship evolved a togepi as i was leveling it and other comp mons up xd

pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont have any extra codes but i do have an extra volcanion i can trade you would you trade the modest giratina for it i can give you full details as soon as i do my other trade and get get on pokemon y to get all that info p
pokemontrades,not_removed,were you still interested in trading for volcanion
pokemontrades,not_removed,each one is usually random ivs but i can do some breeding if you need something specific
pokemontrades,not_removed,i would love to i am currently working through an issue with my eventmon spreadsheet but that is one of the mons i can verify so if you can give me a day to go get my copy of y im not in my dorm atm i can finalize it for you
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello i do have an extra volcanion i can trade you would you trade the modest giratina for it i can give you full details as soon as i do my other trade and get get on pokemon y to get all that info your event is missing details required upon offering rule if you do not have access to the info please refrain from offering please read our httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikirules and reply to me with the necessary information
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont need anything specific i just really would hate to get stuck with something that has bad ivs xd can you trade now
pokemontrades,not_removed,volcanion eng ot helen id classic ribbon met self obtained from na gamestop code
pokemontrades,not_removed,just give me a few minutes as i need to breed and do a couple of things irl
pokemontrades,not_removed,where and from whom did you obtain it if it was selfobtained this must be explicitly stated from the event or from mystery gift is not sufficient for event pokémon as it does not explicitly state that you downloaded it from the event yourself if it was traded on rpokemontrades please state the name of the user who traded it to you if known if it was traded for on another trading community please name the community and if known the user who traded it to you if it was traded to you from a friend please be as specific as possible as to how they obtained it
pokemontrades,not_removed,no prob
pokemontrades,not_removed,i got a na volcanion code from gamestop and redeemed the code edit another thing i just rememberedi had a brain fart and redeemed the code on the wrong game so i did trade with myself in order to have volcanion and its item on alpha sapphire instead
pokemontrades,not_removed,would you prefer a love or moon ball alola vulpix
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks your trade partner has a rule violation elsewhere but i will reapprove the comments once that is sorted
pokemontrades,not_removed,love ball please p

pokemontrades,not_removed,id be interested in tornadus and that whismur take your pick
pokemontrades,not_removed,shiny granbulltrophy received in a trade in y with a random passerby otadam thank you however please do not offer this shiny here unfortunately if you are unsure of a pokemons legitimacy it cannot be traded here this includes getting it from the gts wonder trade passerby trades friends and etc please read the httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikirules
pokemontrades,not_removed,hmm the big issue is that articuno is generally the more soughtafter bird so they generally dont trade with moltres or zapdos often on the gts
pokemontrades,not_removed,willing to do rayquaza and lugia then

pokemontrades,not_removed,if we hadnt confirmed a trade was i supposed to make an entirely new thread if im commenting on their thread
pokemontrades,not_removed,you have not disclosed the necessary information when offering these previous generation events
pokemontrades,not_removed,i thought i said i had obtained it the suicune is static pid and i would have to redeem the wishmaker jirachi from the disk so i dont know ivs is there anything else i would need to list im asking so i know in the future i forgot to say the jirachi hadnt been obtained yet so i couldnt list ivs
pokemontrades,not_removed,gamestp draco meteor jirachi httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikistaticpids
pokemontrades,not_removed,did he list all the proper info for the suicune
pokemontrades,not_removed,youre right i forgot that was gen iv
pokemontrades,not_removed,no it is not the user has not provided the required information yet you should have noticed that the comments were removed
pokemontrades,not_removed,but didnt he just provide it by saying its a static pid
pokemontrades,not_removed,gamestp draco meteor jirachi once again the user has not provided the required information yet
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh so even if i am just trading for the suicune he has to list all of the info for all of the pokemon

pokemontrades,not_removed,hello im very interested in your meloetta could you tell me if it has been touched at all has it gained explevels for example
pokemontrades,not_removed,it is lv no experience or evs gained i taught it relic song in place of teeter dance its other moves are the same as when i got it round psychic and close combat it does not have pokerus its currently not holding an item but i can give it a pp max like the original event
pokemontrades,not_removed,that sounds perfect to me can i offer you anything in addition to the hoopa your meloetta is a few years old already so id say its more valuable than my hoopa also would you still happen to have the wonder card for it
pokemontrades,not_removed,unfortunately no the original game broke just after the release of pokebank i dont need any other pokémon besides volcanion i have a complete living dex d i have the more recent meloetta event as well so my pokedex is fine
pokemontrades,not_removed,thats too bad but im all right with it and if youre sure about that ill gladly trade for i have hoopas with different language tags a language set so is there anything in particular that youd like eng or maybe another tag

pokemontrades,not_removed,if you have a spare code can i take it please i would be interested in the yveltal or xerneas if yveltal isnt possible

pokemontrades,not_removed,no not really though ive added a bunch of other wants to the op so see if theres anything there
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello it is highly recommended that you list some things that you would be willing to offer for trade in your post otherwise people may think that you are asking for stuff for free which would be against our rules see httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikirules
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry only looking for one genesect so not really enough for a set
pokemontrades,not_removed,yep no nicknames would you be able to redeem the code perhaps sorry for the inconvenience im a na player
pokemontrades,not_removed,its alright i decided against trading them thanks though
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have the thundurustornadus but i can only trade during the afternoon
pokemontrades,not_removed,and if you want to be really really generous then you could give it to me xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh sorry i will list them in a while i cannot right now
pokemontrades,not_removed,no problem with a straight redeem if you wanted ivsnatures though im not sure im going to have time today
pokemontrades,not_removed,no worries
pokemontrades,not_removed,its okay i dont care much for ivsnatures because shiny yveltals pretty much a trophy event hahaha

pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks a lot d
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you too
pokemontrades,not_removed,how many would you be looking for
pokemontrades,not_removed,how many for ray d
pokemontrades,not_removed,how many for the legendary birds i missed the newsletter so ive been looking to trade for those
pokemontrades,not_removed,around
pokemontrades,not_removed,i want to say but that is probably too high really want at least this is probably my most valuable event up for trade so i dont want to let it go for too little
pokemontrades,not_removed,i am tentatively trading one ray event for volcanion codes you would have to offer more than for me to reconsider
pokemontrades,not_removed,i can get you that would you do it for the ray
pokemontrades,not_removed,understandable i could meet in the middle at i dont think id have them ready day since i have already taken on other reservations and my gamestops were super finicky about giving extras last time but id definitely have them by the at the very latest
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah ok i think thats too many for the birds thanks anyway
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea i would do that
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have another offer for the ray for do you think you could do that it wouldnt matter which day of the distribution just as long as i had time to redeem them btw the ray has wc proof but is lightly touched as it was infected with pokerus by its original owner pikadex
pokemontrades,not_removed,udatonehamster were you still interested in the galileo rayquaza or no
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i can do that especially without a time crunch as long as it has no xp gain its all good
pokemontrades,not_removed,no xp gain afaik i will double check that when i have a chance im guessing that the codes will be valid for at least a month so no rush at all
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah so far the code cards have been valid months out from the distribution arceus distro was august but is redeemable through november
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey you can actually let the other user have ray after digging around flairhq untouched galileos are going for codes or equivalent as badly as i want one ill wait it out thank you though
pokemontrades,not_removed,now worries thanks anyway
pokemontrades,not_removed,how many custom shinies would you be willing to do for this summer shiny palkia ot id sassy got in trade from user vladkar on this subreddit wc proof the user had two different palkias so the wc could have been originally for either of those just throwing it out there
pokemontrades,not_removed,probably just one because of the questionable proof
pokemontrades,not_removed,ill have to pass then good luck
pokemontrades,not_removed,ive got an ha poliwag want that dbha tangela as well got marill got riolu some decent goomys as well

pokemontrades,not_removed,hi i can offer a bagon horsea for a ha scyther
pokemontrades,not_removed,what might you want for the poliwag can you also offer more than one its kind of a hassle to trade for just one small mon thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey honestly i dont really care for the balls at the moment plus are you aware that my togepi is male it cant pass down its dream ball so its worth less than your feebas and i dont think its a fair trade for you im interested in dbha feebas please pick two mons houndour please pick mon while trading since its a please trade me a trash mon for the last one
pokemontrades,not_removed,ill get back to your in a sec im trying to finish a trade just below you by the way the pokemon you are trading me is worth of my ha mons so you can pick more also the togepi is currently held for baequaza who i am currently trying to trade with

pokemontrades,not_removed,hello ujoeliuscaesar sorry but this thread has been removed because it violates rpokemontradeswikirules in the future please do not post trade threads more often than once per hours your was posted more recently than hours ago if you are looking to make a casual trade in gen try posting in the latest this action was performed by a bot if you think there was some mistake please click the report button next to this comment and a human will take a look at your post shortly
pokemontrades,not_removed,i did some thinking and some attempts at getting a galileo ray and i think you are my best chance assuming nothing changes in the near future so i wanted to let you know that if youd like id like to revisit our previous conversation from one of your threads im away from my ds for a bunch of the day today but i may be able to talk still
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure theres a few options from what i see i dont think its fair to do a trade for you for one of the compsemicomp ones and im not interested in any of the other ones p ill tell you now though that trading is definitely the patience game ive been posting for lowtier common and xyzs for almost weeks now and i still dont have everything all thats else is for me to add to the trade on my side i have some self obtained volc codes and shinies on my spreadsheet that you can look through and see if theres anything you like
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey sorry i have been out all day its a busy week let me look at your sheet and note if i have any interest in anything else
pokemontrades,not_removed,is it always this slow heres a few other things i saw dbha growlithe shaymin as i missed that event dont care the stats aldora zapdos if you had a iv rufflett that is something i would appreciate as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah cause its really about luck you gotta just happen to have something that someone else wants and at the right time p i actually have an extra shiny dbha growlithe if youd be interested dreamball growlithe ot dusky id adamant justified would you be willing to trade for galileo ray growlithe volcanion codes for
pokemontrades,not_removed,im not excited for volc codes particularly since i cant sr my game anymore do you have anything that you consider worth roughly volc codes instead or even something worth or volc codes and would you throw in a dbha non shiny boring female growlithe so i can breed it so galileo ray shiny growlithe nonshiny boring dbha growlithe something worth or or volc codes my goal is to not trade anything i am given again and so far i have succeeded if you can do that we have some to agreement
pokemontrades,not_removed,would you be interested in a naive anni victini no vcreate the ivs are sort of decent and i obtained it from ixiusroulee with wc proof
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry was sleeping you have the wc proof for it it wasnt posted there in that thread i much prefer the victini to volc codes so it would be from me for galileo ray row shiny growlithe dbha not shiny boring growlithe female the victini if you are ok with giving shaymin instead of victini i prefer that if not i wont argue i can probably trade it for a shaymin i would think
pokemontrades,not_removed,ill have to think about the shaymin cause i value the ones i have more since they have proof and are good natures while i was planning to sr the other one
pokemontrades,not_removed,alrighty want to think about it for a few hours im busy for at least a few hours i think either way we will come to a deal
pokemontrades,not_removed,any thoughts now that its a few hours later
pokemontrades,not_removed,going to be heading out to dinner soon no hurry in thinking just letting you know
pokemontrades,not_removed,in class right now for around more hours sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,its all good i will be out for a couple hours too
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry i dont think i want to trade any of the shaymins that i have would you still be alright with the victini
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes i will accept the victini i may try to swap that for a shaymin it does come with proof right
pokemontrades,not_removed,it only comes with wc

pokemontrades,not_removed,is it male or female
pokemontrades,not_removed,sent thanks for the trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,i was thinking you could just deposit the charmander on gts and i would trade you the treecko
pokemontrades,not_removed,looks like i cant find it ill deposit a male dbha lvl treecko for charmander instead
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i still have just put anything up on gts and ill give it to you
pokemontrades,not_removed,if you could give me around ten minutes im dealing with another trade sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay cool

pokemontrades,not_removed,you do it cause i wouldnt know what to request so just put anything and ill find it
pokemontrades,not_removed,do you want any of there other gen iii starters
pokemontrades,not_removed,ill take the treecko now that i think about it
pokemontrades,not_removed,just put up a lvl male treecko requesting a bulbasaur
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont see it so take it down before it gets sniped ill put mine up like last time
pokemontrades,not_removed,you there i dont want to put it up if youre not ready
pokemontrades,not_removed,nice i still like spending fc to level up
pokemontrades,not_removed,idk if im seeing things but i just checked the global goal for this mission and we have collected bp on our first day damn heavy ball here we come
pokemontrades,not_removed,ooh this gave me an incentive to attempt to beat red again ended up beating him the first time once i reached because his venusaur froze in a row p
pokemontrades,not_removed,time to grind some bp
pokemontrades,not_removed,anyone have any good qr code team for battle tree
pokemontrades,not_removed,that tyrantrum w double team can go to hell
pokemontrades,not_removed,what bp for heavy ball i think this is impossible this is too much im really need heavy ball but seriously are you crazy omg
pokemontrades,not_removed,this shouldnt be too bad i got about just by myself through multiple attempts at trying to beat red
pokemontrades,not_removed,does this include the royal
pokemontrades,not_removed,iyuuuuuh
pokemontrades,not_removed,we can definitely get just get team your comfortable with and just keep grinding out the bp isnt the goal but that heavy ball is
pokemontrades,not_removed,easy i can grind out about a day think about hundreds of thousands of people doing the same thing
pokemontrades,not_removed,i just saw bp after somewhat an half of a day gf are you kidding whats wrong with you do you not take us for full puuuuh so my anger is gone sorry if i offend anyone except gf
pokemontrades,not_removed,cool
pokemontrades,not_removed,so how many bp from the battle tree must we collect in order to get the full fc
pokemontrades,not_removed,one heavy ball as an extra possible reward for tackling the hax tree is irrelevant as irrelevant can be how about an unreleased mega stone because obviously the battle tree is so much fun laddering for bp when the ai always cheeses their way steals your win and fucks your precious streak much more fun if you dont have a competitive team ready nah we cant have nice things
pokemontrades,not_removed,i think the goal has already been reached i saw another group post the numbers can someone confirm
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh man ive got a box of competitive pokemon just itching to be used cant wait to try them all out and grind some bp
pokemontrades,not_removed,we destroyed this mission good lord
pokemontrades,not_removed,you are seeing the numbers correctly
pokemontrades,not_removed,got the heavy ball lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,dbls or singles i cant get very far in doubles but have had more success in singles
pokemontrades,not_removed,this is the real question training your own team is great but if the goal is to get as much as possible in a short period of time we need a stacked team
pokemontrades,not_removed,rbattlefactory has a pretty good collection of qr rentals up not too hard to find a decent one there and for a bit of shameless selfpromoting i posted a team of my own there a while back that seems to work well
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont have a qr team but i recommend teams with sash kartana as that it going to either sweep your opponent in turns or break through and a half at the least
pokemontrades,not_removed,one that i put together ive been using the trio of mimikyu tapu kokolele and celesteela which is good enough to reach in super singles fairly consistently
pokemontrades,not_removed,lol looky this woolfpack member jk
pokemontrades,not_removed,there is going to be a lot of people doing this and considering that at max you get bp per battle there is a good chance we will hit this goal qr teams are good
pokemontrades,not_removed,once you get a team you are comfortable with the bp just start rolling i bet you could easily get bp by yourself if you just grinded for an hour or so on most days of the event just gotta believe
pokemontrades,not_removed,its will be hard but no pain no gain i have tried to do some battles and i added around points to the score there was already about points gained in hours
pokemontrades,not_removed,i earned like bp on my own trying to get to wins in super multi over the course of a week lol its not that tough
pokemontrades,not_removed,whats special about the heavy ball
pokemontrades,not_removed,think this is impossible check the global missions counter we have on our first day your battle tree grind is done if you want it to be lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,no battle tree only i think
pokemontrades,not_removed,yep we doubled the goal for the entire event on the first day global missions went from to reeeeeal quick
pokemontrades,not_removed,i havent even register yet so if what you are saying it true we should get heavy balls per person p
pokemontrades,not_removed,theyd better give us at least double the amount of fc when we hit million bp
pokemontrades,not_removed,it has already been exceeded
pokemontrades,not_removed,
pokemontrades,not_removed,it was singles im not great at either formats i think i just got really lucky this time i seem to have more luck with doubles than singles though
pokemontrades,not_removed,it actually happened to me tho lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,i gonna enter this global mission now hope we can get heavy ball fighting d
pokemontrades,not_removed,and global mission fail and i understand that not many people want to catch wild pokemon and island scan since they already catch them whats the point to catch many as possible since you already catch it this global mission doesnt make any sense global mission is complete because we always trade pokemon on gts everydays and hours and it making sense global try to get bp in battle tree as much as possible this mission make me doubt that it will success or not but im really need that heavy ball so i will try my best and gotta believe like you said ha ha ha
pokemontrades,not_removed,i just check and it is now i cant believe look like is possible
pokemontrades,not_removed,i used to fight in battle tree many month ago after i beat the game i spend almost hours just to get around bp to buy focus sash but that time my team wasnt perfect ok i will try my best with this global mission here we go d
pokemontrades,not_removed,for me heavy ball is suit for beldum magnemite tauros and carbink since these pokemon is genderless and male only the only way to get these pokemon with hidden ability in heavy ball is to sos chain by myself i tried to trade these mon from gtstheir capture in heavy ball of course but all of them dont have hidden ability so i need more heavy ball to complete my collection
pokemontrades,not_removed,you only get one in the game so theyre valuable
pokemontrades,not_removed,the last time i check it is so i think maybe is possible im so exhausted with battle tree today but after i realize it reach by your comment all my worries are gone im done with this tree ha ha ha thank you everyone who participate this and make it happen
pokemontrades,not_removed,at least or they should give us a task who is not easy peasy i have nothing against gifts but then i should be declared as such and not as thrilling task or boring
pokemontrades,not_removed,
pokemontrades,not_removed,so if i personally go get bp from the battle tree ill get fc heavy ball rare candy
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,i am the exact opposite i can blow right through to in singles but can hardly get past in doubles maybe because ive been avoiding building my doubles skills
pokemontrades,not_removed,same i ate rotom because it always has willowisp and double team every normal type has blizzard and glaceon will forever be my enemyi only play double battle

pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for the correction
pokemontrades,not_removed,spaztix is correct it is was for the heavy ball if you go get bp you get all that you listed above
pokemontrades,not_removed,actually the pgl says you need to get bp to get the rare candy
pokemontrades,not_removed,i could barely make it through normal singles to get to so i could get the mega stones lol ive only made it to around in super doubles but i think theres a lot more focus on building doubles teams so thats probably why ive even made it that far what team do you use for singles if you dont mind me asking with the upcoming competition i may need the help if i want to actually win a battle
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes i notice that im so relieved right now xo xo

pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for the offer though
pokemontrades,not_removed,aha sorry just missed ya but its okay at least this way i can also help someone else out too
pokemontrades,not_removed,logging in right now
pokemontrades,not_removed,same here
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you
pokemontrades,not_removed,aha no problem and thank you too now i have a complete collection of berries
pokemontrades,not_removed,pheremosa goes with kartana gotta give up a celesteela for a buzzwole moon gets pheremosa and celesteela sun gets kartana and buzzwole most arent willing to do your requested trade because they lose more
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have seen trades like these going well also i still dont have celesteela since im breeding abras for the natures
pokemontrades,not_removed,a use the daily thread for questions about value and stuff b if it has a beneficial nature it could be considered a semicomp shiny they have value but not many people are after them rsvexchange destroyed the value of shinies someone could breed and hatch a shiny chansey in minutes of work someone could still offer you a legendary for it but if you ask on the gts you will get it almost immediately
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for info this helps a lot
pokemontrades,not_removed,keep in mind that pokemon from the gts especially legendary or better are not considered to be legit i am not sure if this is a factor for you but you couldnt trade your shiny on the gts for a legendary pokemon and later trade that here since you caught your shiny it has your ot and ot id so you can prove that it is legit by including your information pic of your trainer card etc your chansey is probably considered a trophy shiny and if you search this sub for trophy shiny you should get tons of results which will give you an idea of what people will trade for them also httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikirulessidefull ot and id no are required for certain pokémon you are required to state the ot original trainer and id no when offering for shiny pokémon competitive legendary pokémon event pokémon that do not have a preset otid no if you are unsure whether your pokémon falls in this category include the information
pokemontrades,not_removed,didnt know that about legendary pokemon on gts so thanks for letting me know a big part of the fun for me personally is doing it all legit breeding is my favorite part of the game and hacking totally devalues the hard work i put into breeding ill for sure check out trophy shiny maybe ill find match for my dream trophy shiny nidoking thanks again for info it helps a noob like me a lot
pokemontrades,not_removed,no problem at all i am still learning things myself having only started playing pokemon a year or so ago i completed my dex with the help of the gts and wondertrade so i am not hating or anything just trying to inform it really just depends on what you want to do with the pokemon i have even received hackedcloned pokemon from places like rpokemongiveaway or rpokemonplaza which i have used to compete in recent tournaments i collect legit pokemon but sometimes i like to be able to do things i would not be able to do or have access to otherwise i am a noob to competitive but i like to actually try my best and without a lot of viable pokemon with awesome ivs it helps having people in the community give out clones i always keep them separate in my bank and am sure not to trade them or anything just my opinion anyway
pokemontrades,not_removed,totally understandable didnt really think about it like that before but youre right as there are values for having both legit and hacked trying out a tournament sounds really fun but i think i still have a lot of learning to do before then i might have out those subs and get some competitive pokemon to play around with thanks again for info every bit helps
pokemontrades,not_removed,i started competing for the participation prizes only to be honest some of them are event pokemon that arent available any other way i always complete the minimum requirements nothing more it just makes sense to me that i should have the right tools in order to learn how to use them eventually i would like to breed my own competitive pokemon but it takes a lot of time and effort even with the help of places like rbreedingdittos heck i just ran out of money because of breeding on my main save file
pokemontrades,not_removed,i can help if you want
pokemontrades,not_removed,question though do you have a woobat or swoobat
pokemontrades,not_removed,i do not unfortunately is that a dealbreaker
pokemontrades,not_removed,nah its cool ill still help you having a woobatswoobat would have just been better add me and send me a trade request

pokemontrades,not_removed,ill trade you breedjects of absol and smergle for azelf and cobalion
pokemontrades,not_removed,what are the ivs nature and balls

pokemontrades,not_removed,is that your best smeargle and absol
pokemontrades,not_removed,its the best i have on hand i just loaded up my diamond and found i have them already so this is just to save me a step its up to you just let me know when you want to trade for the murkrow at the least
pokemontrades,not_removed,im only interestwd in gwn mons though if you havw a gen smeargle i guess i can do both
pokemontrades,not_removed,my smergle and absol are both gen i was talking about the legendary pokemon i found either way my comp murkrow and breedject smergle for your azelf and cress sound good
pokemontrades,not_removed,i guess thats fine oh i made a mistake for the cresselia its a jolly nature not lonely you still ok
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah thats fine
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi sorry but ive removed this since theres a wifi universal code the actual codes are obsolete and should not be traded here

pokemontrades,not_removed,that would be awesome ill add you right now
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok give me a couple minutes to breed and hatch it
pokemontrades,not_removed,sounds good
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks man
pokemontrades,not_removed,your magbys ready
pokemontrades,not_removed,the question is to renew or pray for gilding days of reddit gold remaining
pokemontrades,not_removed,was probably ask a hundred times but why does the majority ask for legendaries or good pokemon at level or above for absolute garbage pokemon
pokemontrades,not_removed,i just wanted to brag that today i bred a shiny lileep and my dreams have come true it has its hidden ability storm drain sassy nature ivs decent defence four egg moves mirror coat recover stealth rock tickle and comes in a dream ball also my first competitive shiny and preevolution to my favourite pokemon the only thing that could have been better would be female and missing speed but hey you cant have everything maybe that will be a future breeding project it only took about eggs using the masuda method shiny charm too so i was pretty lucky i wasnt even trying at the time i was actually just attempting to breed a one big thank you to ujrwdouble for providing me with the original parent just under a week ago you are a legend
pokemontrades,not_removed,im kind of glad i didnt do my rotom giveaway yesterday as i can now do it during the gts mission what would be a good fodder pokemon to ask people to deposit for my rotom
pokemontrades,not_removed,not sure if this is the right place to put it but i have a spare na volcanion code for use i was going to post a giveaway but i didnt want to wait hours just to post my trade afterwards x please let me know if youve used the code and enjoy the volcanion
pokemontrades,not_removed,breeding question do the pokémon breeding have to be exactly the same to pass the ball or can they be from the same evolutionary line and still have the same chance for example friendball male snivy x pokeball female ha seperior friendball ha snivy
pokemontrades,not_removed,going to be sring for a shiny typenull soon what nature do you think is best for him seems hard to pick as he is so even on all accounts
pokemontrades,not_removed,the qr rentals are wonderful it will make it so much easier to play with my brother who doesnt really breed pokemon
pokemontrades,not_removed,question regarding the relative value of pokemon and what comparative value can be found when trading for example what is a genesect worth vs a volcanion vs a shiny magicarp event code vs any normal event pokemon whats worth the most
pokemontrades,not_removed,so i have two celebi from a event one of which has a timid nature both have a few exp points earned so they arent ut should i train the timid one to be a br mon or would that just ruin it
pokemontrades,not_removed,what does db stand for example im looking for a db pikachu
pokemontrades,not_removed,guess ill try asking here i got a japanese dbha larvitar from the gts i bred it and tried to trade it with a friend got a message there seems to be a problem with your pokemon when attempted to trade when i put it into the gts it went up just fine but my friend cant seem to find it when i tried to wt it showed the same problem with your pokemon message next i bred it with a safari one also got from gts then tried to wt the offspring safari ones but the same message appeared i cant trade them at all both balls ha or not i dunno what the fuck is wrong with my larvitar anyone with same issues
pokemontrades,not_removed,so im trying to trade a dbha druddigon but it says theres a problem with the pokemon and so it wont let me trade it has ems which are all legal so im not really sure what the problem is does anyone know if this is just another trading glitch update its a lot more than the druddigon legal dbha pokemon arent being allowed to trade when they could be traded a few days prior anyone know whats going on
pokemontrades,not_removed,does anyone know what time volcanion redemptions stop i know today is the last day but can i redeem them until midnight local time
pokemontrades,not_removed,say i transferred my living dex to omega ruby but it was before i got the national dex once i get the national dex will those entries then be registered
pokemontrades,not_removed,whats the best way to go about moving my xy save copy from the stock sdcard to a new
pokemontrades,not_removed,did the release of pokémon bank for make resetting for events any faster no right still have to get to the first pc which takes about minutes right
pokemontrades,not_removed,can somebody give me a good idea as to what a lunar karp code would be worth i dont want to give a bad deal or receive one
pokemontrades,not_removed,does anyone have a link to a guide on how to import pokemon data and have it autoformat to your google sheets spreadsheet im working on moving my bank stuff over and im quite exhausted of having to input everything manually i know theres template spreadsheets out that do this but i like my spreadsheet and would like to continue using it edit i actually got this figured out on my own was surprisingly easy
pokemontrades,not_removed,managed to get both a latias and latios for castform on the gts looks like its time to go gts hunting for the rest of the xyoras legendaries
pokemontrades,not_removed,so i just found out the hard way dbha ducklett isnt tradeable is there any more that is still wrongly trade banned
pokemontrades,not_removed,anyone seen an article or post explaining when well be able to trade our freaking pokebank pokemon this is really annoying when i cant trade completely legit events or breedables
pokemontrades,not_removed,ill ask here since i dont know where else could i i tried making a pgl account for my pokemon moon but everytime i try logging in at the website it refreshes and i cant log in ive tried from my phone and my pc but had no success ive been trying for over a week now im from argentina but my account is registered as us since i prefer english and nintendo is almost non existent in here so i just register everything as us
pokemontrades,not_removed,so i was trying to help out with the global mission even moreso than just the giveaway i did today so i was swapping magnemites for magnemites on the gts when the worst possible thing happenedit errored and told me i disconnected and had to shut off my now i have a trade banand ive seen some posts online that say it can be as long as a week does anyone know anything about this how long does it last any way to speed it up etc
pokemontrades,not_removed,well im proud of myself i had four classes today so i thought i wouldnt be able to finish redeeming my na volcanion i wanted to try to trade some away but that didnt work out i was thinking about a giveaway but thatd be so personally painful since well i love so i started farming them at topspeed today and somehow i was able to redeem all of the codes i was trying to and i did most of it in one sitting between classes the joy of having three reset games and three and playing them simultaneously and bank of course so now im happy already redeemed almost all of my na genesect a few days ago so i can finally have some peace from event farming that is until i trade for more
pokemontrades,not_removed,are megastones tradable in gen im referring to ones obtainable in sunmoon like charizardite xy if for ex someone beats red and gets a charizardite can they trade it on a pokemon to another mostly just want verification for future purposes
pokemontrades,not_removed,how much would a language set of modest timid volcanions be worth
pokemontrades,not_removed,one last volcanion code for na region
pokemontrades,not_removed,i just deleted my save on as without realizing i would lose my wonder card redemptions is there anything i can do now that the save is wiped or will everything ive obtained from it have no proof
pokemontrades,not_removed,probably a silly question but with the new ball inheritance rules with sm does it mean that all aprimons can potentially have their ha even earlier gen ones thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,so my mate just dug out his old ds and platinum and found he had an unclaimed event for the shiny entei with extremespeed just wondering what we need to make sure we take photos of during the claiming process to act as proof if he ever decides to trade it away
pokemontrades,not_removed,with the increasing prevalence of having access to cfw and subsequently pkhex is anything going to be done in the future about confirming the legitimacy of certain exclusive items i ask this simply due to the how mega stones are going to be distributed this generation with only a maximum of having access to each of these stones i can see something happening where someone just makes for example mawilite and is able to capitalize on the perceived value of these stones because they are supposed to be pretty rare
pokemontrades,not_removed,haha is it that good the benefits seem a bit meh but then again im not a hardcore user
pokemontrades,not_removed,
pokemontrades,not_removed,wow gg rod
pokemontrades,not_removed,damn it actually worked gg
pokemontrades,not_removed,because theyre trolls and they revel in it you can take solace in the fact that there are now filters to get rid of the legendary requests and only show pokémon you have
pokemontrades,not_removed,probably himym or house those were great shows
pokemontrades,not_removed,have a ton but probably the wire was the most remarkable
pokemontrades,not_removed,boku no pico for the sega genesis
pokemontrades,not_removed,avatar tla
pokemontrades,not_removed,agents of shield skyedaisy is bae
pokemontrades,not_removed,gravity falls
pokemontrades,not_removed,havent watched it in a long while but i remember really liking scrubs
pokemontrades,not_removed,im more of a youtube guy i hear that theres this netflix show called magicians that is supposed to be a good harry potter kind of a head scratcher there i really enjoyed harry potter
pokemontrades,not_removed,masterchef
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have many favorites but if i had to choose probably lost
pokemontrades,not_removed,mr robot was pretty nice
pokemontrades,not_removed,just making sure ur not one of the few who hasnt seen firefly yet
pokemontrades,not_removed,if you have netflix i have recently enjoyed stranger things jessica jones luke cage unbreakable kimmy schmidt other random favorites the office family guy archer futurama modern family parks rec rock
pokemontrades,not_removed,right now voltron legendary defender season really hit me right in the feels
pokemontrades,not_removed,hard to pick some favorites but here are a few that stick out to me comedies arrested development sharp comedy that you should actively pay attention to the first seasons get better every time you watch it scrubs easy comedy to watch in the background with a great core cast the bromance between jd and turk gets better and better rock tina fey is a genius running gags galore and smart commentary if youre looking serious westworld brilliant look into the ethics and implications of turingtested androids black mirror each episode is a standalone with a new castnew plot very powerful and sobering topics so id recommend not bingewatching but rather spacing them out like one each night orphan black a show about human clones all played by the same lead actress tatiana maslany who is absolutely brilliant
pokemontrades,not_removed,well for me the shows that are my fav are the ones my wife wont stop watching house walking dead supernatural gilmore girls a series of unfortunate events himym and the list goes on and on
pokemontrades,not_removed,congrats did you use the swap method
pokemontrades,not_removed,not abra ive had issues finding people who put up abra for whatever reason
pokemontrades,not_removed,you should let those of us who read your comments in the ddt know what you are requesting ahead of time
pokemontrades,not_removed,for my giveaway i found that oricorio worked really well cutiefly was really hard to work with cause one of those streamersshiny giveaway people were using them
pokemontrades,not_removed,i use male salandit
pokemontrades,not_removed,to narrow it down look for a pokémon that is easily to get and is not common that mean island two or three ive good expierience with paras and bubungus is the german name im too lazy to look after the english one
pokemontrades,not_removed,just so you know for future reference giveaways and trade threads are counted on separate hour timers so you could have done bot if you wanted
pokemontrades,not_removed,they must be exactly the same species
pokemontrades,not_removed,after all the different builds i read about him i still went with naive on mine srd one that only need bottle caps on him d
pokemontrades,not_removed,timid all of silvallys best options are special attacks
pokemontrades,not_removed,whoah what are they like pokemon stadium style rentals
pokemontrades,not_removed,qr rentals are live
pokemontrades,not_removed,since there are multiple genesect events that really depends
pokemontrades,not_removed,well youll find it hard to find specific values for such or such events now here are a couple of thing that will usually affect the value of event traded here there are a lot more things of course method to obtain them instore events are usually more valuable than wifi events since its more complicated to get them or to farm them duration of the event events available during a few days will be more valuable than those going for a few months since there will probably be less of them geographic location most of users here are in na and eu so japanese or korean events usually go for more since not so many people can get them still going on if the events is still going on you could say that the number of pokémon for that event is still virtually unlimited so they wont be as valuable as events that are already finished to take your example the late na genesect and volcanion event were available in store with code but there was no limit to the number of codes you could ask so it was really easy to get them now the shiny carp codes currently available are only distributed in a very limited number of countries so they are going to be more valuable for more info check events events guide in the banner at the top of the page its more complete
pokemontrades,not_removed,i would keep them as ut as possible
pokemontrades,not_removed,it stands for dream ball
pokemontrades,not_removed,ive traded dbha larvitar on this sub just fine maybe movepool ticks it off
pokemontrades,not_removed,not sure about legality of your specific mon but there are known issues with the gts and not being able to trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,legality check is messing up today with link trades gts doesnt seem to affect it i couldnt trade my dbha larvitar either even though its legal hopefully theyll fix the problem soon
pokemontrades,not_removed,i just traded dbha bred in sm hours ago must be pretty recent o
pokemontrades,not_removed,if you are in na i would assume pm pst based on past distributions
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes 😁
pokemontrades,not_removed,do you have an sd card reader backup the entire card you want to replace then transfer to the new card save the old card and do not erase it until you confirm the new one works correctly
pokemontrades,not_removed,make sure you computer has a sd card readerslot grab your sd card from your and insert it into your computer copy its entire contents to a folder called sd card backup etc eject the sd card and insert the new bigger sd card into your computer format if necessary otherwise copy everything from sd card backup to your new sd card that is all between this process do not play on xy or you wont be able to restore your save file if you do play and save start over and make another backup
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont see why it would become faster
pokemontrades,not_removed,you can use to do this by using a custom for instance the following template speciesnamenaturenameabilityname would generate rows like these remoraidquietmoody kecleonadamantprotean vanillitemodestsnow cloak you would just need to copy those lines to google sheets and select the option to paste formatting split text to columns and have commas as the separator
pokemontrades,not_removed,is the most comprehensive list ive seen
pokemontrades,not_removed,
pokemontrades,not_removed,dont believe everything you read on the internet the trade ban is a sort of a scam check and only lasts for an hour at most
pokemontrades,not_removed,theres the anniversary genesect codes that will expire on february and the lunar magikarp codes on february
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes they are you can make a pokémon hold one and then trade it if im not mistaken the only items that cannot be traded are zcrystals tms and key items
pokemontrades,not_removed,is anything going to be done in the future about confirming the legitimacy of certain exclusive items no hackedcloned items may be traded without disclosure please see the httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikipolicy for more information
pokemontrades,not_removed,if a single trader is trying to trade a lot of exclusive mega stones like or more such as mawilite and beedrillite then an examination of their trade history is more helpful imo i guess you can demand proof that a person received a mega stone legitimately but i dont imagine a lot of people going through the trouble of taking proof picturesvideos
pokemontrades,not_removed,pretty much the only use i had for it when i tried it was being able to tell when a new comment was posted though tbh res can do a lot more for free its only really helpful if you browse on mobile
pokemontrades,not_removed,i set a dark theme so i dont hurt eyes when browsing in the dark 😁
pokemontrades,not_removed,true a special friend of mine gilded me i know who it is 😁
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah that makes sense i guess thanks it kinda just makes me angry seeing these ridiculous things especially considering the new global mission
pokemontrades,not_removed,you sir are correct
pokemontrades,not_removed,
pokemontrades,not_removed,this
pokemontrades,not_removed,awesome gravity falls is one of my fave shows d whos your favorite character
pokemontrades,not_removed,httpiimgurcomnhmtbkkgif o
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dislike harry potter so i dont know much about it other than the magical school theme which is something that has been around for ages thats as far as the similarities go in the magicians the main character is a fan of a series of books called fillory and further that are more akin to narnia than anything else nbsp the show is actually good and aimed at a more mature audience the characters are well written the plot advances at a fine pace and its very humorous despite some scenes being just gruesome most episodes are decent while some are really great and a couple are mediocre at best overall i enjoyed watching it and seriously recommend it but dont dive into it expecting it to be the next big thing
pokemontrades,not_removed,iron chef is better
pokemontrades,not_removed,whoa whoa lets keep orphan black off of here okay go to plaza or something
pokemontrades,not_removed,i didnt just the tradition breedaheapofeggs method i think next time i will either use the swap method or the magikarp rng method
pokemontrades,not_removed,both rock and grass have the most weaknesses at five each but combined cradily only has four weaknesses i think that is pretty cool also grass is my favourite type and i like the design too
pokemontrades,not_removed,i think i have an idea on what pokemon people should deposit
pokemontrades,not_removed,dont worry ill post again later on in the week on the details of my giveaway this saturday just need to iron out the details of my giveaway
pokemontrades,not_removed,gah i was afraid of that thanks for the quick response
pokemontrades,not_removed,which one is naive
pokemontrades,not_removed,you can rent peoples teams from generated qr codes on pokemon global link usable in the battle tree and battles with your friends
pokemontrades,not_removed,here is some info
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah
pokemontrades,not_removed,probably means the gf one
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for taking the time really useful info i have just obtained some karp codes and didnt really know what i should expect for them this certainly helped
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay thank you
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry should have specified i can trade some dbha just not all—even though theyre all legal c
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks worked beautifully a bit of an expensive trashcan for breedjects though p
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks im not too techsavvy but i assume my kingston sdadapter is compatible with the one from toshiba right its just like any other cable in principle
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for the reply this is actually exactly what i did d
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you ill give this a go as well looks much faster
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey there ive actually got a followup question for you if youre still fielding them ive got the data importing and am using vlookup to pull the sprites from a resource tab which is all working great but i wanted to see if there was a way to autofill a charttype sheet like have it search for pokemon name and pokemon ball type and if it finds a match it fills in the cell and if not it doesnt it seems like a simple truefalse setup but im not sure how to use boolean code in sheets
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you d i hope i wont need that list for long though hopefully game freak fixes it
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok i though that was a bit extreme but ive seen it in multiple placesim hoping that those people were doing something more unsavory than an innocent gts disconnection and that mine will be back in no time
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks i appreciate it
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea thats my concern no one will think twice about obtaining proof for these items as a community were only going to have access to of these stones if these events are capped at the same number as previous events they in theory are going to pretty rare why would we not require proof of legitimacy
pokemontrades,not_removed,my advice host a giveaway most are done via gts if you give away pokes thats more gts trades youve made
pokemontrades,not_removed,i know right i loved it i think ive watched every episode at least twice
pokemontrades,not_removed,first episodes are like ugh what is this and all of a sudden its and youre halfway through the first season
pokemontrades,not_removed,atla is the original series korra is the sequel which is what i think youre thinking of i cant personally recommend watching korra without watching atla but you probably could get away with it if you really want to its just incredibly difficult to enjoy all of the throwbacks and nods to atla in korra though
pokemontrades,not_removed,hmmm avatar the last airbender is the original series the nickelodeon animated series not the shyamalan movie
pokemontrades,not_removed,its a hard choice between mabel and grunkle stan theyre both such awesome characters
pokemontrades,not_removed,i wasnt aware that the magical school theme was an old trope as far as i was aware rowling invented the concept
pokemontrades,not_removed,human clones pokemon clones
pokemontrades,not_removed,fair enough good luck doing a sandygast giveaway rn since i have boxes of breedjects about a whole box of ivs to go through
pokemontrades,not_removed,hopefully i will remember to be around on saturday d
pokemontrades,not_removed,cant you breed a ha snivy from your female seperior and then use that to breed with your balled snivy
pokemontrades,not_removed,speed up special defense down
pokemontrades,not_removed,sick cant wait until they find out the best battle tree strategy and some cool guy distributes that qr set for everyone
pokemontrades,not_removed,do you get bp from the rental teams too
pokemontrades,not_removed,so there arent any qr teams available right now
pokemontrades,not_removed,when i go to their qr website it shows nothing for me nevermind i see it now thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,i would personally agree with broe that said it is really up to you do you plan to trade one or both of them in the future i would keep them forever in your position and keep the comp nature one as ut as possible the other one i would play with
pokemontrades,not_removed,the legality filter is terrible hopefully it gets patched soon
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i dont see why not hope it works
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah it shouldnt take too long its happened to me and some friends a couple of times and each time its taken about an hour
pokemontrades,not_removed,hows it going still banned
pokemontrades,not_removed,the legitimacy policy does not seem very clear about that allowed without disclosure hackedcloned items but then the definition does not seem to take this kind of megastones into account a hacked or cloned item is any item that is available through normal gameplay that has been added to the game or duplicated through various means these include available mega stones standard poké balls held items vitamins etc these are allowed to be traded here looks like this is a new mission for the mods more headscratching incoming one of the problem i remember was that lets say you have a legit stone and you receive another one they are both kept in the same slot and its now impossible to distinguish them
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i probably will prepare for one in the near future
pokemontrades,not_removed,my favorite is mabel for sure
pokemontrades,not_removed,again i dont care much for harry potter since it strikes me as a pure compilation of overused tropes painted with a different color to mask it as something new back in the day i read the first three books in one sitting and quickly lost interest after that portraying a wizard academy as something more akin to a private boarding school may indeed be something originally done by rowling wizard academies in general far from it even tolkien mention those in his middle earth books most prominently the famous wizardmage towers this theme is something that have since then leaked to other universes ranging from written fantasy like in discworlds unseen university rpg games like the circle tower in dragon age or like in pretty much every dd setting and campaign involving wizardry
pokemontrades,not_removed,b
pokemontrades,not_removed,thats a lot of sand good luck
pokemontrades,not_removed,of course thats just extra work lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah that could be good since then it can be used as a normal and special attacker
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah
pokemontrades,not_removed,there are tons
pokemontrades,not_removed,i may trade one in the future and keep the other i asked this because they are right now on my pokémon white game in order to use them competitively they should learn giga drain which is a oras tutor move so i couldnt transfer them to sumo almost ut if i ever want to play with them i think i will keep them as they are though thanks for the advice edited i messed that up i said energy ball
pokemontrades,not_removed,great how simple they made this console easy to access and replace batterymemory and even pokebank loaded instantly with my credentials d looking back at my last nintendo purchase the gameboy adv sp
pokemontrades,not_removed,looks like im back
pokemontrades,not_removed,hackedcloned items may be traded as long as they are legal this includes the upcoming mega stones
pokemontrades,not_removed,hell if everyone on this sub did a giveaway of a box of pokémon wed hit the million in no time lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,i mean it did bother me that quidditchs rules actually didnt make much sense and seemed to be set up just to glorify harry but besides that definitely not a bad series for childhood havent given the series a second reading as of yet tbh
pokemontrades,not_removed,iama hax you heard it here first
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh huh for some reason none show up for me
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay wait i managed to find some question do i use the island scanner to scan the qr code or something else
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay i was not sure the event nature of the items would fit the available through normal gameplay thanks for clarifying
pokemontrades,not_removed,but you cannot get these stones through normal gameplay they are event items i understand that its difficult to currently tell if an item is hacked but i feel that this is a special case why theyre event items it wouldnt be too difficult to add a event mega stone clause to rule since we have to download them just make it a requirement to provide full details of redemption just like all other event pokemon
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah that would be awesome
pokemontrades,not_removed,to be exact
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry for the long post for a kid yeah its not bad notice that i never said it was bad just that i dont care for it its just immensely overhyped undeservingly so nbsp just now you thought that rowling invented the wizard academy concept and thats understandable because every wizard school since then has been piggybacking on rowlings take on it due to harry potters popularity it makes you think that she came up with the whole deal for example i mentioned the unseen university it first appeared in a book published in the colour of magic the first harry potter came out in nbsp i was a kid when i read those books i mentioned even as a kid the whole universe seemed off in way more aspects than just the quidditch rules for example you can do magic to fix a pair of glasses but you cant repair a flying broom granted youre kids but cant a grownup help you if you ask the first magic you learn teaches you to levitate stuff so dont tell me you cant do that on a regular broom to turn it into a flying one youre studying in a magical world in a magical town and no one has wards against magic three kids steal an invisibility cloak and no one catches them they go around town getting into private chambers and there are no countermeasures against it cmon whats stopping a thief or murder from doing the same and do they even need money there the whole hey harry guess what youre rich is the lamest excuse for a deus ex machina that ive ever seen also every single book revolves around a macguffin and even rotating characters always fill the same role like the teacher of darkarts always filling the role of the antagonist even if not being the actual one in the series magic only serves to advance the plot in some gimmicky way the whole world she created otherwise does not seem to remember that magic even exists nbsp i could write an essay on stuff thats wrong with harry potters plot and writing in general the books did get better with time but looking back at the style on the first ones it makes me think that it was due to a lot of editingpressure done by the publishers
pokemontrades,not_removed,you have to be logged into pokemong global link then you need to click on generate code on whatever team you use qr code can be found as an option on the team choosing window whenever you battle it will launch the camera
pokemontrades,not_removed,there are a lot of items that are eventonly including several past mega stones take blazikenite for example we have never required any items to be from their respective source for a few reasons items are inseparable if you receive a hacked item which you have no way of identifying and add it to your bag you cannot separate it from the rest of your properly obtained items of that type they are a nonissue too few people care about the way an item is obtained for us to go out of our way to enforce something like rule for them the rules are very strict as is so enforcing extra rules on items of all things may come across as petty from the legitimacy policy for hackedcloned items it is not so much that we endorse or support them in any way it is more a matter of simply being impossible to tell a cloned item from one legitimately obtained we simply understand that item cloning is very widespread and there is just nothing we can do about it
pokemontrades,not_removed,to add to what willster said the sort of event items that would be disallowed if not legitimately obtained would be stuff like old sea map oaks letter etc
pokemontrades,not_removed,git er done
pokemontrades,not_removed,i mentioned the unseen university it first appeared in a book published in the colour of magic since you mentioned it i wonder whats the deal with death not returning pterry to us unless the man himself doesnt want to return but i guess i can understand that
pokemontrades,not_removed,the levitating spell only works as long as its held by the caster so imbuing a broom with magical flying capabilities would probably be out of the question for young students and if i recall i think the only time a broom went wonky was when someone was actively using magic to mess harry up another explanation for why a broken broom would be difficult to repair might be that the brooms are crafted in a similar manner to wands using magical items like unicorn hairs for their cores so mere wand magic probably wouldnt be able to permanently restore its powers a friend did bring up the fact that its stupid that quidditch leagues dont just have standardized brooms so that rich kids cant buy obvious advantages like in the second book movie i thought that was a pretty good point and also i believe the cloak was a legendary and almost unheard of relic which spoilers actually turns out to be one of three deathly hallows gifted to humankind by death himself so end spoilers that could explain the general lack of preparedness however they do have invisibility spells and potions i think so idk i dont think they worry about casual murder as much in the magical community because i think the ministry has ways to detect when a murder happens so its much harder to get away with than in the non magical world the only way to get away with it evidently is to be a part of a magical terrorist organization where there is strength in numbers as for money yah that was a bit of a deus ex machina having harrys dead parents leaving him a bunch of money kind of makes sense though them both being bright and successful you do see class issues pop up here and there eg ron not being able to afford a lot of shit and having a broken wand for a whole school year how dumb was that though not one teacher was kind enough to help that little poor red headed kid by getting him a new wand that thing was obviously a danger to himself and others but i guess that would have killed a few jokes and the dark arts teacher thing is true except i think for the fifth bookfilm they do explain this its been a cursed position since was it voldemort that applied for the position and got rejected cant remember but your point still remains not really sure what you mean by that last point i guess you can point to specific instances where magic advances the plot but its not always and the world certainly thrives on it and you see it everywhere
pokemontrades,not_removed,i got it working thank you c
pokemontrades,not_removed,maybe because the world already had its turn any more and we would end up being selfish the man may pass but the work persists
pokemontrades,not_removed,you know the death and terry pratched are old buddies i guess he sitting in his living room with some british tea and gossip a lot and so they forgotten the time you know that guys
pokemontrades,not_removed,not really sure what you mean by that last point i guess you can point to specific instances where magic advances the plot you did that yourself in your own post i think the only time a broom went wonky was when someone was actively using magic to mess harry up the cloak actually turns out to be one of three deathly hallows not one teacher was kind enough to help that little poor red headed kid by getting him a new wand that thing was obviously a danger to himself and others but i guess that would have killed a few jokes and the dark arts teacher thing its been a cursed position what i meant was that outside the harry potter vs valdemort plotline you dont see people using magic and that deathly hallows one is a prime example of pulling rabbits out of a hat it was introduced at a later time to try and poorly fill an old plot hole pun intended if the cloak was that big of a deal why not guard it better the kids are students shouldnt teachers be more aware problem is invisibility is a thing even time traveling is a thing and btw is that time travelling thing cant remember what it was a pendant in book a deathly hallow also shouldnt general wards be in place watch the magicians the show you mentioned magic wards are everywhere nbsp the levitating spell only works as long as its held by the caster i meant a version of that surely there are variants to a spell and they couldve asked a teacher because a friend did bring up the fact that its stupid that quidditch leagues dont just have standardized brooms so that rich kids cant buy obvious advantages like in the second book movie is indeed a very good point
pokemontrades,not_removed,the pendant iirc was called the time turner and im pretty sure it wasnt a deathly hallow just some insanely op object dumbledore gave to hermione seemingly to help her take multiple classes at the same time but him being the wise old man he is probably intended her to use it to help with the main plot line stuff not sure why it was never used again probably because introducing time travel into your work of fiction is a giant death trap for most writers i really dont know what you mean when you say you dont see people using magic outside the harry vs voldemort plot line you see it in peoples hones with them enchanting the dishes to wash themselves you see it at the quidditch world series or whatever that was you see the people at the ministry using it for transportation you see the side characters using unique spells at times to keep things interesting i could go on and yes i said you could point to specific instances where magic advances the plot i wasnt disputing you my point was theres also a lot of times where the plot advances without some overtly magical force leading the way so plus its a story about a magical world of course the story is going to be carried by magic at certain points seems like a nonissue to me
pokemontrades,not_removed,ill give another shot at explaining my point then so long and hopefully final post about this the pendant wasnt a deathly hallow so its safe to assume that its a regular magical item even if it is rare its not unique so there may be others like that and more the cloak is not a deathly hallow but the much more powerful time turner isnt why because it suits the plot and the authors story should never be a satisfactory answer to that question but in this case its the only one we have nbsp dumbledore gave to hermione seemingly to help her take multiple classes at the same time lets forget the fact that shes one of the main characters and consider the actual proposed fantasy world for a second with an objective point of view what made her so special shes smart but arent there other smart students in other years who might also need it isnt this unfair to the other students who might also be qualified to take several classes but just dont have the time and therefore lag behind her are the other teachers not aware that shes using this shouldnt that impact her grades since its basically a cheat time manipulation is dangerous wouldnt simply rearranging her schedule be better because she keeps going back in time to attend different classes isnt she having hours a day isnt she tired im not talking sleepy here but actually freaking exhausted nbsp but you answered that question already didnt you but him being the wise old man he is probably intended her to use it to help with the main plot line stuff and there you go the time turner is a magical item that no one else in the harry potter universe is allowed to use that not even the main characters remember to use in those instances when it would benefit them but would be detrimental to rowlings plot thats meta right there but that a little girl is permitted to use so that it allows the plot to advance in a manner that the author sees fit the whole griffin shenannigan nbsp thats a popular trope named chekhovs gun which isnt bad in itself the misuse of it is because the author introduces a magical item when it benefits her storytelling and arbitrarily neglects its existence or try to rationalize why it shouldnt be used as soon as it doesnt suit her goal of writing pages of a conflict that couldve been easily resolved in had the item been used thats very poor craftsmanship right there nbsp not sure why it was never used again probably because introducing time travel into your work of fiction is a giant death trap for most writers and you know that you assessed that yourself when you pondered why it was never used again and stated that it was a death trap for most writers then why even introduce it in the first place why use a plot device if you cant fully work it justify its use and proper existence within the fantasy world take advantage of it for other plot lines again shes showing us her flaws writers avoid doing that you said so yourself she didnt she did employ it she simply did it very poorly she pretended it didnt exist when she could not justify it not being used in other instances nbsp you see it in peoples hones with them enchanting the dishes to wash themselves you see it at the quidditch world series or whatever that was you see the people at the ministry using it for transportation you see the side characters using unique spells at times to keep things interesting i could go on thats just fluff its akin to saying hey reader look theres magic and stuff going on in the background think critically why would people grownup men and women who live in a town filled with magic that probably went to the same school as those kids werent rons parents wizards and went to that same school that can walk into a store and buy a magical item or wand as you and i could go and buy potatoes stop at using magic to clean dishes when a simple young student is allowed to distort the laws of space and time to attend extra classes give me a break the real magic is only being employed to advance the main plot those spells potions artifacts are forgotten as soon as they dont benefit rowlings notion of plot when the magical world uses magic is only to remind the reader that it exists that its there still they dont use it in any meaningful way not in any way that could severely change the entire plotline say like using a time turner to go back in time and kill voldemort before he is even born oh wait but you shouldnt right because you shouldnt abuse the power of a time turner heedlessly not even if youre one of the most powerful wizards in the world and not even if it is to alter something like a mass murder from potentially ruling the world one day with his dark magic but on the other hand give it to a teen who isnt even graduated from wizards school so she can use it to gain extra credits yea sure thats perfectly fine thumbs up nbsp my point was theres also a lot of times where the plot advances without some overtly magical force leading the way so i never said that the plot only advances through the employ of magic i said that magic is only used by characters when it is needed to advance the plot plus its a story about a magical world of course the story is going to be carried by magic at certain points and thats fine my whole point is that the world is not coherent yes there is magic but you only see it being used as a crutch for the plot to lean on you dont feel like the socalled magical world has significant magic other than the students and the teachers of an academy nbsp you should really read other books about magical fantasy worlds like i did even before i picked up harry potter i guarantee you that your vision of the entire works of jkrowling will drastically change edit for spelling and format
pokemontrades,not_removed,i mean the hallows werent a classification of the most powerful magic items ever they were just items from a fairy tail one of which happened to be an unbeatable wand theres no saying how many one of a kind unique magical items there could be in that universe and the thing about dumbledore being unfair and partial to certain students i believe thats actually addressed in the book in fact certain parents use that as an argument to get him kicked out of his headmaster position at one point i think the malfoys specifically probably he would trust such an op relic to hermione because he knows hermione is a good kid that believes in adhering to the rules and wouldnt abuse it also for much of the book she keeps it a secret from everyone so i dont think its too far of a stretch to say that no one noticed she was attending multiple classes at the same time she wasnt the most social or noticeable after all i think your distinction between real and fluffy filler magic is a bit arbitrary probably most wizards didnt see the need to go pursuing legendary artifacts or splitting their souls into horcruxes household magic and things like invisible flying cars apparating and other day to day things were all most people probably needed true that they never went into magical wards besides a select few times in the later books when theyre protecting the weasley house or hogwarts but perhaps that more technical stuff can just be implied not really worth mentioning how common people protect their houses from invisible sneaks if it doesnt benefit the plot in anyway would have been a cool detail to add to flesh out the world sure but really there are tons of other details could be that rowling just wasnt as focused on fleshing out home defense or wizard life insurance lol agreed that the time turner was a giant mess though i think i remember reading in an interview somewhere that rowling called it one of her biggest regrets you cant even retcon it like the luck potion from people wonder why couldnt you just use the potion to brew more potion and thus have an unlimited supply and become successful at whatever youd like and the answer given was that the potion doesnt work based on your intent it just kind of randomly guides you to a result based on random happenstance like convincing you to take a different road home with time travel theres just no way around it maybe it only works within a certain range preventing people from going too far back even still what happened to it when the triwizard tournament was compromised or when the death eaters launched a surprise attack on the castle still rowling does excel in creating an interesting folksy universe full of nuance and history perhaps not comparable to the vast universes of tolkien or dnd but thats fine by me as a kid i wasnt trying to spend weeks looking into creation myths and thousands of years of martial history just a neat little universe that packages up a kids story nicely edit rowlings attempt at retconning the time turner and also her thoughts on the subject at the bottom

pokemontrades,not_removed,hello your events are missing details required upon offering rule please read our httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikirules and update your post with the necessary information then reply directly to me so i can review it
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have to go through all my events and post the information here i will if necessary
pokemontrades,not_removed,if you are offering those events here yes
pokemontrades,not_removed,i removed this post since i have lots of events and would rather not go through them all
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright can you at least disclose the events you plan on trading here in the future as well as where and from whom you obtained them
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes of course my fault i had people that replied to me and i think you deleted them can you repost them so i can continue with those trades
pokemontrades,not_removed,no one posted comments in this thread except us however we cant allow users to simply say i would rather not provide the necessary information as we need to be aware of this info upfront upon offering rule since you did not provide it you have already broken our rules i am cutting you some slack already by not having you post the info for every one of them
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea i get it and i appreciate it i meant on other threads i had comments to my replies on their posts they were removed right before you posted asking for the information a second time so i just thought you removed them my bad if you didnt
pokemontrades,not_removed,i do need you to resolve this before posting or commenting elsewhere on the subreddit
pokemontrades,not_removed,did we not just resolve this what do you need me to do
pokemontrades,not_removed,can you at least disclose the events you plan on trading here in the future as well as where and from whom you obtained them
pokemontrades,not_removed,i removed this post as i will just be commenting on other peoples posts this thread will no longer be used i thought this was clear sorry about that
pokemontrades,not_removed,by here i meant the subreddit

pokemontrades,not_removed,all of my dbha mons are on my moon game currently and the bank wont let you transfer gen to gen unfortunately would you still be interested
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea thats cool not that big a deal ill update my flair
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok sorry about that i suppose i shouldve specified beforehand im breeding them now so ill let you know when theyre done
pokemontrades,not_removed,no prob thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi id like to add in the mimikyu and jangmoo
pokemontrades,not_removed,the vulpix piplup and chimchar are all dbha perfect ivs i hatched a turtwig before a perfect if youd rather have that or i can keep hatching for a one
pokemontrades,not_removed,didnt get the notification for this because you replied to yourself but i dont mind doing those would you want the mimikyu in a love ball or a moon ball
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh my bad i guess moon ball
pokemontrades,not_removed,not sure if you saw my other post the vulpix piplup and chimchar are all dbha perfect ivs i hatched a turtwig before a perfect if youd rather have that or i can keep hatching for a one it may take a little while to hatch the jangmoo due to dragons taking forever to hatch if thats ok
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry not sure what the difference between and perfect iv is the all or no if you cant finish tonight tomorrow is fine
pokemontrades,not_removed,iv is in all stats except for spa since turtwig doesnt need an spa stat whereas is in all stats its basically the same thing to me it doesnt affect anything and ive already bred the others so ill just finish jangmoo if youll be around for a little while
pokemontrades,not_removed,i guess ill take if you have it yea ill be around
pokemontrades,not_removed,how many codes for the aldora birds
pokemontrades,not_removed,im interested in an aldora zapdos whats your rate
pokemontrades,not_removed,rate on mews mewtwo kor gardevoir hoopa
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi the set has ideal natures so i want around codes for it though depending on how quickly you can get codes for me i can go lower
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi which zapdos are you referring to i have a third one selfobtained not in sheet yet with jpn tag and modest nature as well that i might also be willing to trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi here are my rates both mews are sred for comp ivs so i would want codes each for them adamant is a bit cheaper though mewtwo is reserved kor gardevoir is semireserved for codes if you could do more codes than that in a short amount of time i can reserve it for you instead hoopa i can do for codes
pokemontrades,not_removed,im going to move this thursday but there are a lot of gamestops nearby my new place im also going to get codes before i move
pokemontrades,not_removed,im going to move this thursday but i can get you five codes before i move also there are a lot of gamestops nearby my new place i just want to be clear that were doing this for the aldora set not for an individual bird
pokemontrades,not_removed,also can i ask if i could use your spreadsheet obviously not your pokemon i cant find a good one
pokemontrades,not_removed,absolutely i mean codes for the whole set let me know when you have enough codes and also hope the moving goes well
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you and ill let you know
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey just checking back to see how its going with the codes also did the move go well btw i must have missed your message about the spreadsheet template sorry about that anyways i would gladly share mine with you im happy that you asked d i will send it in a pm when i get access to my computer just send me a message if i happen to forget p

pokemontrades,not_removed,ok thats cool so dbha eevee and feebas for dbha riolu and spiritomb youll have to give me a while to breed it as it may take time to get a female riolu though if thats ok with you

pokemontrades,not_removed,its all good
pokemontrades,not_removed,so there you go i hope those prove helpful to you btw the magikarp and mimikyu are both already pentaperfect so you can go straight to ev training those if youd like also i noticed the gibles you were giving me were in ultra balls w no egg moves so i gave you a female gible in a dream ball with egg moves the axew is in a level ball and the exeggcute is in a friend ball so those should get you some good stuff for trading purposes anyway i hope you enjoy the free pokes

pokemontrades,not_removed,yep i can do one for each
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey now i will not take no for an answer you have done way too much for me that ducklett you traded just to receive prizes has been a key trading figure for me if the system here didnt require both sides to trade something for it to count as a trade i wouldnt honestly accept anything in return no more no less unless you want more then cap for x mons i might be a bit as i forgot pichu cant breed so im rasing friendship while i breed the others gotta make sure to get those hidden abilities for you
pokemontrades,not_removed,cool ill catch you in maybe an hour at most will you still be here then
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey which solosis did you want i have two c
pokemontrades,not_removed,hate to break it to you but you cant stop me from putting a bottle cap on every single one of my mons

pokemontrades,not_removed,uh the one that has all or most ems if theres no difference then it doesnt matter to me
pokemontrades,not_removed,listen just because i have literally no power here besides not trading you the pokemon which would more than defeat the gesture doesnt mean i cant pretend to have the upper hand p

pokemontrades,not_removed,hey i saw in the daily discussion yesterday that you were looking for your konikoni poliwhirl i havent traded for mine yet and wasnt planning to do you want it
pokemontrades,not_removed,do you feel its worth more than a common be honest please
pokemontrades,not_removed,did you still want the froakie i have some else looking at it but they havent made an offer yet if you have any item offers feel free to tell me
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok ill put on pending for now be ready to list your offers when you can
pokemontrades,not_removed,are you ready to offer i dont think its fair to keep it on pending for so long plus im trying to clear out my pc as soon as possible if you dont mind
pokemontrades,not_removed,im just paranoid that i traded away mine im very particular with things like that thank you for the offer though was there anything you were interested in on my list
pokemontrades,not_removed,no will trade you a luxury ball cyndaquil will em if that interests you
pokemontrades,not_removed,what items are you looking for
pokemontrades,not_removed,so are you still missing any from the want list of previous post or have a new want list
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry i was on the process of breeding the shuppet with the egg moves you can go ahead and remove the pending today i havent been able​ commit to trading thanks and good trading
pokemontrades,not_removed,no worries i wasnt sure if it was a wanting to have it on hand to have it or wanting to have it on hand because its yours type of deal so figured id offer db smeargle is peering at me from under that acorn hat a little i dont really have anything useful on hand to trade right now anything in particular youre looking for items wise
pokemontrades,not_removed,no im sorry but im not interested if it not worth more than a common you dont have to offer something of value like that cyndaquil im talking about common pokémon like anything found on route or lillipups do you have any items youd like to offer for it or would you like to hear what im looking for
pokemontrades,not_removed,ill take a bottle cap or rare candy for it if you dont have any feel free to list all the items your willing to offer for it
pokemontrades,not_removed,im still looking for everything on my want list
pokemontrades,not_removed,heads up im getting the ducklett spring and summer deerling glameow purrloin dunsparce and girafarig
pokemontrades,not_removed,no problem are you sure you dont want it
pokemontrades,not_removed,bottle caps rare candies movetype boosting items any item used for evolving pokémon particularly through trade bp items and berry juice p
pokemontrades,not_removed,one rare candy
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,i want it but my schedule will leave me with short time for trading this weekend and it wouldnt be fair for others that are active
pokemontrades,not_removed,ive got a ridiculous number of items im never going to use cursory check shows upgrades magmarizer electirizer and a bunch of typeboosting stuff like charcoal and nevermeltice but ive probably got specifics if you want them havent used many items on this playthrough what kind of ratio would you want for smeargle
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure put it on a common like a yungoos or something and meet me at the plaza
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok im sorry good luck
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont know im having trouble thinking its currently where i am considering its a dbha i feel like its worth a lot
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay online at the plaza
pokemontrades,not_removed,dbha does tend to have a lot of value for a lot of traders for sure if you want to sleep on it and get back to me or pass on the trade entirely since i dont really have any mons youre looking for i totally understand
pokemontrades,not_removed,have you added me
pokemontrades,not_removed,im not going to pass on the offer i think im going to sleep on it im may repost this when i wake up how do you know if you dont have anything im looking for if i didnt include it in the post did you see my previous post
pokemontrades,not_removed,added and online
pokemontrades,not_removed,i didnt see your previous post no im just assuming because my current list of onhand trades is extremely low since i havent started my breeding projects but ill go check and hopefully catch your repost sleep well
pokemontrades,not_removed,im there
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you for the trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok thank you final question are you a markiplier fan i ask because i thought saw it said mandiplier on your first comment just curious
pokemontrades,not_removed,indeed i am xd mandiplier is my ign in moon
pokemontrades,not_removed,cool ok that was my last question good night
pokemontrades,not_removed,so i was a bit bored and remembered there was a hatching mission going on so let me know if you want any all of them for the smeargle ill also happily take some scatterbugs for them items
pokemontrades,not_removed,omg are they all purebreds or have no ems o if so ill gladly give you the smeargle and as many scatterbugs as you want
pokemontrades,not_removed,some of them may have a hacked ditto in their lineage i did a lot of breeding in oras and kept my favourites but all parents were legitimate none of the mons have ems a few of them are in shop balls quick ball and repeat ball were the ones i noticed but i can breed that out later if youd like im at work right now will you be available to trade in about or hours
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure by the way could you rename the glameow i think you got it mixed up with the purrloin nicknmame
pokemontrades,not_removed,i definitely did oops i meant to breed you a purrloin ill do that real quick when i get home too but you can have the glameow too if youd like what shall i name it
pokemontrades,not_removed,with the smeargle and three scatterbugs you can get three more pokémon for each of the pokémon you got me thank you by the way
pokemontrades,not_removed,heads up i just remembered im looking for a nonenglish glameow so you can keep it ill still take the deerlings ducklett dunsparce girafarig and the purrloin with the smeargle and the three scatterbugs you can get two more pokémon from my list
pokemontrades,not_removed,ooh makes sense no worries then i just got home from work so ill take about minutes to breed you a purrloin instead of the glameow and then we can trade for the other two could i get level ball litwick and love ball swablu please

pokemontrades,not_removed,hey so i went to my gamestop today to get the codes they dont have the cards but gave me receipts printed with the directions and codes on them will that work or would you like to wait for the scratch off since they are a little more reliable on not being used

pokemontrades,not_removed,so are you still interested in this trade

pokemontrades,not_removed,for strictly dbha i would like on those two
pokemontrades,not_removed,or jirachi
pokemontrades,not_removed,jirachi doesnt have proof would you still want it i can link to trade but did not receive a wc photo and it wasnt redeemed for me by request since i wasnt playing in in april

pokemontrades,not_removed,enjoy that perfect mawile d
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks yours too its a iv gible you maybe need to re breed it because the its
pokemontrades,not_removed,you might want to specify that you need it to have or less attack ivs
pokemontrades,not_removed,why do you need a timid one im intrigued
pokemontrades,not_removed,dangit i have a timid kartana accidental reset but it has a perfect attack iv
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks forgot about that
pokemontrades,not_removed,my one chance to get rid of my accidental timid kartana is ruined by some nice guy in the comment section
pokemontrades,not_removed,so beast boost will give a speed boost instead of attack
pokemontrades,not_removed,its a set where it runs more speed than attack for beast boost with timid and attack ivs with swords dance the other evs are then dumped into hp for bulk it can really sweep if it gets going
pokemontrades,not_removed,my b
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah very interesting good luck
pokemontrades,not_removed,that could be awesome
pokemontrades,not_removed,its really a fascinating set its very unique and utilizes the ability a whole new way

pokemontrades,not_removed,part of me is sad it wasnt the shiny from moana
pokemontrades,not_removed,upvote cuz of title
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have a thread with a shiny treecko and shiny venonat interested in shiny froakie
pokemontrades,not_removed,i love you bye
pokemontrades,not_removed,ive already gone there times thats the song that started this pokepun thread trend
pokemontrades,not_removed,i need to start breeding and adding to my offer selection that said barely any of my shinies have moved since i got them so dont want too many spares clogging up my boxes hehe
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello i dont think my reply sent earlier i already have these pokemon but thanks for offering
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for your offer but i am sorting out a honedge with trollolly in the near future so ill pass even though its a good mon
pokemontrades,not_removed,haha yeah maybe im still waiting on that honedge to get hatched so i figured once it does hopefully your offer section gets updated by that time too
pokemontrades,not_removed,well what do you want i can breed it from my breedables
pokemontrades,not_removed,my spreadsheet doh forgot breeding existed i think a bold oblivious feebas would be cool lets be real who doesnt want a shiny milotic if you can manage that bonus points if its female whens the next segment of the breeding wars gonna happen though
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have been a bit absorbed in my own breeding for shinies in my spare time my collection is nearly complete these ones im requesting are actually just bonus ones that i think are okay but overlooked when i made my first wish list because im addicted id like to aim to do another breeding wars saga this weekend its flooding here so im kinda stuck at home today and probably tomorrow anyway best start planning haha
pokemontrades,not_removed,also as for feebas i can give it a shot i havent got a bold one bold ditto but ill see if it can breed with anything ive got that is bold
pokemontrades,not_removed,collection as in living shiny dex or whatlookscool collection and sorry to hear about flooding but looks like you got some nice rainy day activities in store lets see if you can manage a star wars and a song pun in the same titlethread
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont have patience for a living dex yet alone a shiny living dex haha no just my personal looks cool collection you can see it in my spredasheet under the nft personal collection some of them like bewear and zigzagoon were more there because they were offered as a bundle but most besides those two were by choice mareanie was one i didnt initially want either but it was offered for a spare and doesnt look awful so why not haha im not affected too severely though i cant get to work because of the flooding got all my shopping done before the shops closed up though its worse in far north queensland roofs are coming off houses and people needed to evacuate up there unfortunately well ive already designed the giveaway mons and pokepun titles havent included a song title might get a bit crazy trying to do both haha
pokemontrades,not_removed,my spreadsheet haha yeah also in that whatlookscool boat right now amazes me how some people can go for a living shiny dex yeowch i wouldnt happen to have any experience with flooding but blizzards though but hopefully it doesnt border on tragic levels ive also got my own planned ga coming up too hopefully flooding doesnt keep you from checking it out i think you might like one of the prizes and i think i have a bold comp milotic actually want it
pokemontrades,not_removed,well if youd like me to breed from it the return it ill do that it will save losing the ivs when i breed it with other fishies now youve got me curious
pokemontrades,not_removed,not tooottally clear on your text but id have no problem leasing it out just let me know a time i can send it over to you can also gts it over to you too if thats easier
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont need it personally but i can borrow it to breed you a shiny one that you asked for i can trade now just check that i didnt accidentally delete your fc
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright dont recall thrashing a xianthiajasmine so i think were good also im assuming youre going to use sve right if so how do you get your eggs checked
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have soundhax software installed for reading svs i can blind breed one from yours then check those if youre more comfortable i just need a bold one to get started
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah thatll do it and using that to check is fine just curious reddit went down for a bit but i can hop online whenever youre ready just to be clear this shiny bold feebas will be in exchange for a near perfect shiny brave honedge correct
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes i cant promise ivs but i will ensure it is and the best i can get in a batch i hatch my phone was still showing reddit as down so i only just saw this
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah no worries about getting perfect is totally fine youre good to trade now
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry dog needed to go outside despite it being a big puddle to add to said puddle on plaza right now
pokemontrades,not_removed,haha no problem dogs gotta do what a dogs gotta do heading online
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi before you settle for a pokeball id like to make you an offer when i get home in an hour or so im interested in your high plains thanks edit is this an english vivillon
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi sorry for the delay are you interested in either of these comp shiny river pattern vivillon one comes in a net ball the other is in a luxury ball note that only the one in the luxury ball has its egg moves im digging for the thread but i believe i purchased both of these on the exchange theyre sve shinies at any rate ill find the threads river timid f lv luxury ball string shotstun sporepoison powderrage powder ot that one guy id river timid m lv net ball tacklestring shotstun sporeprotect ot lena id out of curiosity do you have any specific vivillon preferences for example im looking for english comp shiny vivillon in very specific balls for my own collection but im always interested in any comp shiny vivillon for trade material at the very least edit i take that backthe second one has one egg move stun spore but not all three
pokemontrades,not_removed,it is english indeed
pokemontrades,not_removed,i prefer to take lvl untouched pokemoni might still take itbut i have to think about itbtw can u reset the ivs
pokemontrades,not_removed,no worries just let me know if youre interested i always level up my shiny vivillon just enough to confirm the pattern and yes i can reset the evs for you
pokemontrades,not_removed,well u could just level it up to see the pattern and then soft reset your gamethat way u will know the pattern and it will be lvl againanyway i will think about and let u know
pokemontrades,not_removed,here is my friend ball hoard do you have any bredables in friend balls i have a random assortment on hand but if youre willing to breed i am as well edit totally misread your title i have a ha friend ball phantump

pokemontrades,not_removed,i see youre not on the other trade in this trade i would really love the friend ball though id prefer you use it then trade because i dont need the candies if you would like i have a large trove of friend ball mons here i would be willing to breed you anything you wanted on this list if that is not convincing enough i can do you one better i recently had a thread where i offered the requesters a fb breedject for their fb after which i went and hunted down the pokemon of their choice to catch in said friend ball i offer you the same deal you get one fb breedject from my list and then a pokemon of your choice hunted down four you and caught that allows us both a brand new and relatively untraded fb mon which is equity for both of us it also guarantees that in the future many others in the community will be getting a new fb mon given i do giveaways pretty often so tldr you get two pokemon and countless other members get a new fb pokemon somewhere down the line thanks for indulging my sales pitch i hope it was convincing

pokemontrades,not_removed,is sandile in a rare ball with egg moves

pokemontrades,not_removed,name some more stuff like the onix different ball etc onix interests me
pokemontrades,not_removed,damn i want both lmao anything else i can throw in for the second poke
pokemontrades,not_removed,forgot to ask what ivs does it have so we can make a proper trade whether it be breedject or perfect
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright what would you like
pokemontrades,not_removed,not much interested in lapras but im sure we can work something out
pokemontrades,not_removed,im ok with that man
pokemontrades,not_removed,no sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,dammit i will find a pokemon you want
pokemontrades,not_removed,absol max ivs atk and spd
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok i have premier ball ha snorunt and scolipede i can breed although i know theyre not bb heal ball chansey with serene grace tinted lens venomoth in a dusk ball moon ball gastly although i figure this might be common mostly those are the ones in different balls
pokemontrades,not_removed,also and before i forget if you happen to get one with hp rock while breeding for ice thatd also be amazing
pokemontrades,not_removed,of course im thinking either that venipede or a poison heal shroomish
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have three
pokemontrades,not_removed,interested in mienfoo and magnemite would it be possible to breed for a timid nature one
pokemontrades,not_removed,cool i actually forgot i had it in my party and caught a magikarpit only grew to lvl but im not sure how the evs were affected
pokemontrades,not_removed,also have it in line im sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,i just got gastly form a trade and the others arent as interesting i can settle for the heavy onix as long as its perfect iv female
pokemontrades,not_removed,are you sure you still want ice i mean fire is really good for grass types im breeding atm too
pokemontrades,not_removed,btw ha heavy onix isnt legal you sure its ha
pokemontrades,not_removed,finished breeding ice onto it a male
pokemontrades,not_removed,both of those will take a bit of time as i havent fully bred them that ok with you
pokemontrades,not_removed,im gonna go with the option ill add have to breed one real quick
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah sure mienfoo female i presume what ability
pokemontrades,not_removed,lmao dont worry as long as no em were forgotten
pokemontrades,not_removed,fuck alright treecko max ivs in sp atk and speed
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah ive been mostly hunting for ha and not bbs so i dont have that much to offer i found a sport ball scizor i have but its a male tt how long would it take you to breed the snivy it might take me some time to get to onix since i just started a new job want to get to it and trade on the weekend ill post when i have one ready anyway
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah with ice i can take down flying types thats why i later thought of hp rock since it takes down fire flying bug and ice which grass is weak to
pokemontrades,not_removed,ooh sorry its rock head i thought that was the ha how is it illegal isnt it possible to breed the ha with a male ang get the ball with the female
pokemontrades,not_removed,yup not a problem let me know when you are ready
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright send a trade when youre ready
pokemontrades,not_removed,regenerator plz and yes female
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah all still there when can you trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have a perfect sceptile too mate
pokemontrades,not_removed,it depends really you just want it to be ha hp ice correct im ok with waiting for the trade ill just try to get it as soon as possible
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh i see thats a good niche to have i have your hp ice snivy ready to trade too
pokemontrades,not_removed,its illegal cause the male only passes ha if its a ditto breeding otherwise its only the female that passes it down
pokemontrades,not_removed,so what are your preferences on genders and yanma ability im sure you want female yanma but what about shroomish
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks fro trading
pokemontrades,not_removed,regen mienfoo correct itll take me some time as i only have f ha one but should be done by tomorrow is this a breedject trade or perfect iv
pokemontrades,not_removed,im available atm i forgot we already traded once lmao
pokemontrades,not_removed,shit gimme a minute
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright alright croagunk max ivs in atk sp atk sp def and speed
pokemontrades,not_removed,ha hp ice modest and say ivs if its not too much to ask as i said i can provide the ha modest snivy to start breeding if you need it
pokemontrades,not_removed,i did not know that i thought it had like chance or something like that do you still want one with rock head
pokemontrades,not_removed,female is preferable for both but if it takes you way too long do not worry about it i want yanma with speed boost for sure shroomish can be either gender as long as the ivs are solid i want poison heal for sure though
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,correct i dont really mind what gender actually perfect iv plz thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,just reminding you of our trade

pokemontrades,not_removed,´
pokemontrades,not_removed,i just selected it from the list since i already captured one before its a lv male pikipek

pokemontrades,not_removed,alright sweet
pokemontrades,not_removed,any interest in a shiny piplup obtained from or in a shiny totodile which i obtained from in exchange for the shiny sandile
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi i am interest in shiny buneary ♂ jolly limber cosmic power switcheroo encore fake out electric ot ana tid or shiny karrablast ♀ adamant no guard pursuit drill run megahorn knock off dark ot brownies tid anything you would like from
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi im interested in a few pokemon of yours and was wondering if youd like abra ♂ timid inner focus dragon ot victoria id no to evolve into alakazam totodile ♂ gentle torrent ice ot clair id no deerling ♂ docile chlorophyll ground ot jack id no all obtained from svexchange and can pull up their hatching threads if you want
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont have much but do you find anything interesting in
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi my the shiny tab
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi im looking to trade away my spare shuppet netball shiny shuppet ♀ female adamant insomnia hidden power steel ot kailee astonishdestiny bondphantom forceconfuse ray
pokemontrades,not_removed,id like the frillish o i have an amoonguss and a vanilluxe both found by me anibal so if you are searching for those id like to trade them b
pokemontrades,not_removed,among competitives id be interested in frillish cubone aerodactyl shroomish and drowzee id also be interested in a semicompetitive bulbasaur see anything you like here
pokemontrades,not_removed,a shiny living dex must be a massive pain even with all the svexchange shinies listed i dont think i have anything to offer since you want everything exchanged based on how competitive they are and almost all of my shinies are noncomp since my favorite method tends to be dexnav there are only two things listed under trophy and i have no interest in either i just wanted to wish you luck since even a nonshiny living dex is a huge project and this has to be a little bit painful to accomplish even with all the help here im also curious what you plan to do about celebi zygarde hoopa volcanion which have no legit way to get their shinies and what youre doing about shinies that are locked in gen are you planning to take the time soft resetting in gens for some of those legendaries if you have already done so id love to know what your numbers were if you kept track since ive got a friend of mine planning the same thing for the weather trio and for azure flute arceus
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey hows it going i have a pair of comp meowth that we talked about aaaages ago for you as well as two semicomp eggs that match your tsvs meowth ♂ mauzi ger name jolly technician electric levelball jusch last resort growl hypnosis tail whip meowth ♂ kathmandu timid technician ghost loveball wekesa scratch growl foul play hypnosis spheal ♂ calm ice body dragon dreamball qwilfish ♀ impish intimidate dark dreamball i consider the hp ghost meowth a so for both of the meowths for your skarmory chansey and karrablast i dunno what you would consider fair for the eggs imo theyre worth a bit less than a trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,any interest in this venonat ♂ timid compound eyes dragon ot kirino id obtained in a giveaway on the sve has morning sun giga drain bug bite and t spikes
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi id love to trade for shiny piplupc
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi im interested in shell armor omanyte i could do it for buneary since im a little attached to karrablast lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi i actually have all three of those already sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have slight interest in the imperfect solosis and the chikorita but it doesnt seem to have the right nature
pokemontrades,not_removed,the only thing im seeing that i have slight interest in is any of the chimchar though its not on my priority list so i may be picky on what id trade for it what were you interested in
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry but i plan on horde hunting myself a shiny shuppet and have banette
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello how certain are you that this shiny makuhita trish is not hacked or cloned
pokemontrades,not_removed,i will not trade a comp for trophies
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry i dont see anything that interests me
pokemontrades,not_removed,i stated in my post that id be taking trophy shinies for semicomps but i do have a list of pokes ill be dexnaving myself which is why i wont take some shiny offers at times since celebi zygarde hoopa and volcanion are shiny locked there isnt much i can do so i just dont worry about themc as for legends i try not to worry about those right now as well i dont really care for legendarys as it is so not having them right away or ever doesnt bother me much eventually i may go to threads or create my own asking if others can rng abuse shiny legends for me i think i may eventually try softresetting in gens though
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh hi wow its been a while probably over a month almost two sorry i completely forgot about our discussion it all came back to me now lol im not sure how to go about this trade i mean i prefer to trade comps with egg moves for others with egg moves im not sure if id want the first meowth i recently spent the time to breed up a perfect moon ball mewoth for a shiny did you see anything you found of interest in the semi comp section for the eggs
pokemontrades,not_removed,almost forgot heres the link
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay works for me
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok i will be online in
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah mustve looked at your spreadsheet wrong good luck trading
pokemontrades,not_removed,as for the solosis i could maybe trade it for the shiny semicomp charmander shiny charmander ♂ timid solar power dragon pulse dragon dance ancient power outrage electric ot jonathan tid obtained here if you want the chikorita i would be thrilled if you could just breed me dbhas not sure how many though although im sure that i wont be needing ones since i got them all covered thoughts
pokemontrades,not_removed,raltsphanpyinkay ha shroomish
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,she told me she caught it herself i mean she gave it to me for free and it doesnt have but one iv so i assumed her to be truthful
pokemontrades,not_removed,you wont hurt my feelings if youre not interested in the level meowth i didnt really bother with ems for either of them since what they can learn isnt really useful for a comp set skarmory and chansey for the hp ghost one then im torn between your kabuto and togepi maybe both eggs for kabuto or both for togepi a trophy if ems are a swaying factor i can go dig thru the bank to find the parents and see what they have
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry but i have this evolution line already
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright adding you and going online
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay ill add you and wait online could you post omanytes info here
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah its my fault cause theres so many different things in different tabs good luck to you as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure i could do that as for dbhas the quantity depends on the quality so if you want perfect spreads itll be about ive done perfects for a perfect comp shiny so id say thats fair
pokemontrades,not_removed,which inkay were you interested in
pokemontrades,not_removed,can you ask her for a picture of her trainer card
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i understand but when a pokemon doesnt have ems even if it doesnt benefit them it really drops their value for me depends in what trophies you have im quite interested in shiny starters or first evos
pokemontrades,not_removed,one second have to check its the right piplup on this cart
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey sorry i had my piplup data confused the piplup data is actually david id no this is what threw me its from the same trade i linked its just i copied the wrong ottid when i made my original post
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for the trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,omanyte ♂ modest shell armor toxic spikes bubble beam aurora beam spikes dragon kewe
pokemontrades,not_removed,im not that particular about spreads for my collection though as long as they have at least to perfect ivs so what would be the rates then
pokemontrades,not_removed,any of the careful ones id prefer the if youre ready to give it up but any of those will do
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea tomorrow but he said he wasnt interested so it dont matter anymore
pokemontrades,not_removed,the ems on spheal are water gun aqua ring stockpile rollout qwilfish has poison sting acid spray supersonic and aqua jet i do have a stock of trophies but im not interested in trading them at the moment i meant doing a semicomp trophy either is fine slight preference for xatu for both of the semicomp eggs if you werent interested in trading the kabuto sorry if that was misleading i just want to know if youre interested in what i have reserved for you so i can free up space in my reserved box in either case
pokemontrades,not_removed,no problem i see where the small mistake was madec thanks for the trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for posting the info here and and thanks for the tradec
pokemontrades,not_removed,since chikorita is but has brave nature id say i may have to check for ivs upon request i have a completed list but not all of them have
pokemontrades,not_removed,i wouldnt trade the unless it was for another i can do the other one though
pokemontrades,not_removed,regardless of whether the other user is interested or not please provide those pictures
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for pink beauty
pokemontrades,not_removed,well it does have ems the chikorita could i maybe get around to ill be mostly asking for the ones also dont bother if they wont have ivs i wont mind but they are preferred so i checked your list ill be asking for a dbha maractus dbha basculinred dbha basculinblue dbha shelmet dbha karrablast dbha druddigon small note i ever i dont reply in time for the next few hours that may be because we are having a power shortage this is because theres a bad storm brewing up in our place and we might have a blackout later on just a small warning
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright ill be online shortly ill post here when i do
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey she no longer has a nintendo so that means i cant offer that shiny for trade anymore beings i cant provide proof just trying to learn this forums stipulations
pokemontrades,not_removed,sure i can do those all for you i can get started nowc if they have their respective natures ill make sure they keep them
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay ill add you and wait for your reply also i just realized that only one of the chimchars has egg moves so if like that one would you mind posting its info here
pokemontrades,not_removed,do not offer this shiny makuhita here
pokemontrades,not_removed,that sounds amazing hit me up if ever youre done

pokemontrades,not_removed,i have a jolly kartana with decent ivs can you catch me a naive pheremosa edit im the ot and already have it caught legitimately in a beast ball
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry no only adamant
pokemontrades,not_removed,actually yes i can trade you a naive pheromosa for that but youll have to wait for me to catch it im currently resetting nihilego for hp fire if youre willing to wait a day or ill get it done asap anything else you want with it hp type or a specific ball to catch it in they will make it more difficult to get but i can try if you really want one
pokemontrades,not_removed,sounds great ill wait for you to get it and i feel bad i dont want you to have to go through so much effort for this trade haha however if you want to challenge yourself hp fire would be nice on pheremosa the minute you get bored trying to find it the naive nature is plenty enough message me or comment back in this thread once youve secured it ill hold on to kartana for you
pokemontrades,not_removed,fire is pretty rare but ill give it a shot thanks a bunch ill give you an update by within hours
pokemontrades,not_removed,honestly fire ground or electric would be great whichever you get first thanks a ton looking forward to the update

pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks also glad for the trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont think genesect is available in sm at all since i think the genesect codes were for gen games
pokemontrades,not_removed,a lot of us are willing to trade things in gen for stuff in gen it takes an extra step but until we can migrate our libraries up its the only real option

pokemontrades,not_removed,cool you still on
pokemontrades,not_removed,yep ill add you
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,no problem any time
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello where did you get this darkrai and both shiny meowstic please also list the ot and id no of each the rpokemontradeswikirules require this information to be posted for all shiny and event pokémon offered here
pokemontrades,not_removed,darkrai was a reedemed code from the official giveaway both meowstics were giveaways from a breeder ot x male id num female id num
pokemontrades,not_removed,to clarify are you saying you redeemed the darkrai yourself for the meowstics can you be more specific as to where the giveaway took place additionally is x the ot of both
pokemontrades,not_removed,x is the ot of both and was on gamefaq forums the darkrai is official as it was a code from the official gamestop giveaways the one that also released a mew and an arceus with it too later in this year
pokemontrades,not_removed,the darkrai is official as it was a code from the official gamestop giveaways the one that also released a mew and an arceus with it too later in this year yes i know what event it is i am only asking if you redeemed the code yourself or if you got it in a trade from someone who redeemed the code x is the ot of both and was on gamefaq forums can you provide a link to the giveaway do you know whether or not either of the meowstic are hacked andor cloned
pokemontrades,not_removed,please dont complete this trade yet
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes i reedeemed the darkrai as for the giveaway it was a long time ago so it probably went into the abyss of lost threads already i kept them for a while so i could have a bunch of shinies to collect to be honest if the shiny meowstics are too much of an issue i dont know if they were cloned its probably better if the thread ends up deleted its better if i dont send some random meowstics if i dont know if they are cloned
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh uh okay
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright in that case please do not offer either shiny meowstic for trade here since most other trading websites and communities are less serious about legitimacy valuable pokémon obtained from these places are unfortunately likely to be hacked andor cloned gamefaqs in particular is known for trading predominantly clones and pokemon from giveaways on other websites are almost always clones please carefully rpokemontradeswikirules before posting as breaking them again may result in a ban
pokemontrades,not_removed,just wanna the people on this sub are great with the kindness and amount of giveaways there are
pokemontrades,not_removed,rip to all the codes that will never find a redeemer the code apocalypse came too soon on another note i see that users are also managing to swipe the jpn giveaway codes so if they have mercy on you maybe theyll redeem codes its so stressful though since theyre so common
pokemontrades,not_removed,
pokemontrades,not_removed,epjw aske
pokemontrades,not_removed,so ive just picked out the winners for and i thought id just share some of the cool stuff so my hooh took soft resets and was the closest to that answer with the nickname im going to be nicknaming it is aureus because its super pretty courtesy of crystalshapeshifter a quick shoutout to a couple of people that made me laugh with their nickname choices too many fawkes with flameo hotman upurrmutation with kaephsii with hoohly jesus
pokemontrades,not_removed,so who ended up with some female scrap eevees i redeemed like for myself in the last day or two and ended up female
pokemontrades,not_removed,the feels when youre waiting for the wifi event to start in na why do i still live here i need to move
pokemontrades,not_removed,does anyone know whenhow to get ns darmanitan i did participate in the unova classic i just dont know if it comes in code form on the pgl website or if its on pokemon link or whatever it may be
pokemontrades,not_removed,just found this unused gardevoir codes while going through my email and cant redeem them as i only have one jpn cart which already has a gardevoir hopefully someone is able to get them before they expire please let me know if you claim a code enjoy
pokemontrades,not_removed,how on earth do people get these codes so fast on the giveaways i have not tried for one but everyone always comments wow that was fast
pokemontrades,not_removed,s na only enjoy let me know when you take it please
pokemontrades,not_removed,are napal legends same otid moves etc i havent been active for two months and ive forgottex
pokemontrades,not_removed,when the code is expired does it say you incorrectly entered
pokemontrades,not_removed,modest nature for cafe pika okay it doesnt have volt tackle
pokemontrades,not_removed,heres my na mew code if it still works for anyone
pokemontrades,not_removed,why am i awake its
pokemontrades,not_removed,is there a thread or list of which abilities are better for which pokemon
pokemontrades,not_removed,anyone see the victini were getting for tomorrows event this are the moves it comes with wheres v create
pokemontrades,not_removed,is happy hour meowth worth anything im guessing you can just reset your game over and over to farm them
pokemontrades,not_removed,so for some reason my new work computer has an internal speaker to that it defaults to when you disconnect your headphones in other news i connected my bluetooth headphones to my new work computer and then went to the toilet without taking them off the range doesnt stretch there well that was fun
pokemontrades,not_removed,does pco fly surf pikachu have a powersaves date currently looking to redeem mine and dont seem to be able to find anything in the hacked events section
pokemontrades,not_removed,when do the na mew newsletter codes expire
pokemontrades,not_removed,where are them gengar code giveaway
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello guys i have a huge problem i accidentially resetted my as game instead of x is there any chance i can get anything back
pokemontrades,not_removed,so maybe im just too late started playing as a month ago but why cant i trade a starter say snivy for another starter tepig ie on the gts i set up the trade offer a day ago and nobodys taken it yetthey all ask for an arceus or kyogre srsly am i doing something wrong
pokemontrades,not_removed,do i have to accept the regi trio from pokémon bank as soon as i buy it i need to buy bank but cant be bothered to take proof of the trio event atm
pokemontrades,not_removed,so im having an issue with mystery gift get with code i cant enter code and it said like you failed to enter the correct code so you cant try reentering the code for a while please try again later is it permanent or tempo really desperate right now
pokemontrades,not_removed,i cannot find it anywhere what time do the mew codes expire im est of that matters im hoping at gmt
pokemontrades,not_removed,can anyone tell me more about the jpn mew events specifically i have a vc mew code and i am wondering can i also redeem a sm preorder mew or are they the same event
pokemontrades,not_removed,how many codes do you think expired and went unused in the last hours
pokemontrades,not_removed,is there some reason that i cant see any persons pokedex tracker
pokemontrades,not_removed,so i have a few questions if i were to buy a japanese would i be able to change the language to english and still redeem japanese events also if there was a jpn wifi event would i be able to redeem it on my na games or would i need a jpn game as well ive been seeing the term living dex alot is that just like bulbasaur ivysaur and venusaurand so on all put in the pokebank
pokemontrades,not_removed,is timid darkrai is worth keeping
pokemontrades,not_removed,eur darkrai codes
pokemontrades,not_removed,today i learned httpsenwikipediaorgwikixyzaffair i think i was quite content just thinking it was because hey the pokémon look like letters lets totally make the games called them and everyone will think were brilliant s politicalz
pokemontrades,not_removed,i cant believe how many darkrai codes are out there only got back to the game recently but does this basically destroy the economy of the trades
pokemontrades,not_removed,i remember reading someone else had asked a couple months back but forgot to check if they got an answer but why are some of my rpokemontrades posts marked nsfw as always praise helix
pokemontrades,not_removed,does anyone know if pal xerneas codes have multiple versions of the first four digits i received one in a trade that starts with and one that starts with
pokemontrades,not_removed,that moment when you get a darkrai but its a neutral nature sr again lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,whats the best nature for mew
pokemontrades,not_removed,one last code i had for na darkrai
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi im pretty new to this sub and have a query ive only really just gotten back into pokemon and have a stack of gen and events sitting on my games that ive transferred forward to gen but because i was pretty casual about it back then i of course have no proof that these events are legit does this mean i basically am unable to trade them here because of how easy they are to clone and hack just want to make sure im doin everything correctly
pokemontrades,not_removed,gardevoirs have expired so i assume gengars and scraps have too i really wanted to help people but i sadly didnt have the time or energy that said i buckled at the last moment and helped people redeem their gengars and gardevoirs literally at the last second i was gonna redeem one final gardevoir meant to be a redemption gift for me but it expired xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,rip to my aldora articuno just to find a redeem for a gardevoir code as well
pokemontrades,not_removed,a bit late but the codes are dead long live the codes finally d
pokemontrades,not_removed,ikr xd i was watching the video a couple days ago i thought the same thing
pokemontrades,not_removed,lol i actually thought it was somewhat normal at least in comparison to other competitors when considering that it was collected over weeks or so
pokemontrades,not_removed,gardes
pokemontrades,not_removed,hoohly jesus this is deserving of an award of its own p a quick shoutout to a couple of people that made me laugh with their nickname choices too many fawkes i also just googled hooh nicknames right when i saw your contest fawkes came up and then i remembered it came from hp since you put that you liked bookmovieetc references in your post i immediately went with that
pokemontrades,not_removed,glad you liked it i plan on naming my shiny blaziken something similar once i get around to breeding for it
pokemontrades,not_removed,i redeemed for myself and were female feels good man ive redeemed more for others but i dont think many of those ended up being female
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have dunno how many scraps i redeemed but i can probably check my flairhq to find out im thinking of using one for fun but im still hesitant about touching events
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you very much i claimed the top one articuno which completed my bird trio you are a legend edit just so you know i checked the other two just now and it seems like someone else has redeemed them
pokemontrades,not_removed,isnt the pal one unknown
pokemontrades,not_removed,usually comes as a code from the pgl website
pokemontrades,not_removed,i think they are expired
pokemontrades,not_removed,i assume some people regularly refresh the new posts i sometimes do when im really bored
pokemontrades,not_removed,yep edit usually only id no are different but this time they are adding to the second digit of the id no each month and ot is always gf
pokemontrades,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrpokemontradeswikicodes
pokemontrades,not_removed,i think it has its own message but im not sure i know that the pal and jpn probably kor mareep too ones are done for na are still active
pokemontrades,not_removed,not in my opinion physical is still better since it has higher attack by when using light ball and timid is still better if you are using special
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,pokemon go to sleep man
pokemontrades,not_removed,cause i need to make about more boxes of gastly eggs
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah damn dont have any codes onhand but i could try to get one na or pal
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello sorry but posts requesting free pokemoncodes are not allowed here please keep this in mind for the future thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,smogon i think that counts
pokemontrades,not_removed,no such thing choose the abilities you specifically want to use smogon is also fairly helpful for a slight direction i myself prefer to use the teambuilder and work from scratch instead though
pokemontrades,not_removed,definitely use smogon for such abilities great help with nature ev spread hidden abilites and moves youd want
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello sorry but this thread isnt for trading please make a trade thread on the subreddit instead thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,only the japanese get the good shit
pokemontrades,not_removed,its worth the time it takes to farm so like using comp shinies as currency around per
pokemontrades,not_removed,that mustve been really shitty
pokemontrades,not_removed,at the top of the page check the events section just use todays date or something from another year of youre really paranoid
pokemontrades,not_removed,sometimes the ps updates for wc injects come after the event has ended depending on the companys update schedule besides its probably not too difficult to edit a mons met date andor the wc date so avoiding the ps date probably wont matter too much just do good proof when you redeem and you should be fine
pokemontrades,not_removed,today
pokemontrades,not_removed,expect to be waiting a very long time for them they tried the gamestop thing for gardevoir but went back to being japan for gengar
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry for your lost unless you backed your save up at some point im pretty sure its lost
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh man im really sorry i know that feel all too well since i did the same thing while farming hope diancies took me nearly months of sulking before i could even look at pokemon again i hope in time you can find the strength to return too
pokemontrades,not_removed,well your mistake was going to gts p but seriously gts can be quite messed up welcome to rpokemontrades where people are just a bit more sane just ignore the carcasses of all those darkrais and shiny gardevoirs
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello sorry but this thread isnt for trading please make a trade thread on the subreddit instead thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,i think its automatic that you get the regis
pokemontrades,not_removed,nope you have to accept the gift from the pokebank girl when she asks you
pokemontrades,not_removed,it lasts hours i believe
pokemontrades,not_removed,i cannot find it anywhere name is findinginformation p
pokemontrades,not_removed,i would expect pm pst but i cant find a definitive answer either
pokemontrades,not_removed,its most likely going to be at am your time im assuming this is the case since thats the time the previous na anniversary distro periods ended
pokemontrades,not_removed,different event ids taiwan is and japan is so you can claim them both in the same game
pokemontrades,not_removed,at least
pokemontrades,not_removed,in game you can change the lang tag but the general ui of the will be japanese and you can redeem the events however im not too sure about wifis you cant play na games on the jpn so youd need a jpn copy as well a living dex is exactly what it sounds like you have every pokemon organized by number sitting in the bank or pc on a game that you dont play
pokemontrades,not_removed,you can redeem jpn codes with a jpn game must be jpn as well but jpnexclusive wifis are actually quite rare napal do a lot of stayathome wifis but jpn usually needs you to be there in real life for the event for example jarvis shiny gengar was supposed to be on nintendo network which is usually means wifi but you could only get it using the wifi at pokemon centres or japanese and the funny thing is most of their irl events use local wireless instead of nintendo network and local wireless doesnt even care about region tldr just move to japan
pokemontrades,not_removed,no
pokemontrades,not_removed,any shred of value the darkrais had is nonexistent now thanks to
pokemontrades,not_removed,it means that they were closed by the op
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have codes that i recieved from the russian nintendo codes were from smyths
pokemontrades,not_removed,i really wanted to help people but i sadly didnt have the time or energy yeah i understand that dont worry i would help too if i could but im waiting to buy a jpn pokemon game im waiting for sm already got the ds though
pokemontrades,not_removed,yep
pokemontrades,not_removed,it seems like a lot of people thought of that too
pokemontrades,not_removed,haha you could always trade it cheap later in a year im sure a scrap eevee will be pretty desirable when the korean es linoone were out i used one for a play through of x still have it somewhere i think
pokemontrades,not_removed,or you could just give them to me please ill be your best friend but really im kinda curious as to how many you got i remember you traded a few codes but i have no idea how many
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah ok im assuming they arent distributing them untill they have posted the results for the competition thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,did they expire i cant check as i already have a gardevoir on my jpn cart i was really hoping someone would be able to redeem at least one of them as it was before in japan wish i had went through my email and found them earlier
pokemontrades,not_removed,even then i swear they must be on the code entry screen
pokemontrades,not_removed,great thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,huh weird i tried it with codes this morning hrs ago and i thought the sg pikac codes were already expired i mightve mistyped the codes though so ill check the original one again thanks for the link that was very helpful
pokemontrades,not_removed,pal darkrai codes not the universal one are still active when i tried redeeming them
pokemontrades,not_removed,hm okay i have a timid one already will probably then go for adamant or jolly for the other i have
pokemontrades,not_removed,no problem im just happy that the code didnt go to waste
pokemontrades,not_removed,customs for someone p
pokemontrades,not_removed,got one from another user thanks though
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello sorry but this thread isnt for trading please make a trade thread on the subreddit instead thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,vcreate victini was a na event back in like to prior to the japanese one so thankfully we had it at one time at least had vcreate and the signature moves of reshiram and zekrom as well if im not mistaken
pokemontrades,not_removed,im new to farming events do you know how to go about doing it
pokemontrades,not_removed,lol i was about to make a on the can joke to a trader i was dealing with but wasnt sure if this sub would put up with that crap ill leave now p
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh that was terrible
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for the advice just a little worried as it doesnt seem that the ps date is out yet which is kinda surprising since the event came out in feb
pokemontrades,not_removed,will do thanks i actually have the physical thank you card with the code from the pco and plan on putting it next to my ds when i do my video proof
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright
pokemontrades,not_removed,do you know the power save date of them would todays date be safe or not
pokemontrades,not_removed,i see i am waiting on those last minute gengar giveaway not gonna let my be alone
pokemontrades,not_removed,do you need some darkrai code
pokemontrades,not_removed,kill me pls im crying so hard i have just finished redeeming hh meowths
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have some battle movies can i do smthin with that
pokemontrades,not_removed,well i got back the same day xd these people who commented on my post boosted my confidence so good
pokemontrades,not_removed,so can i ask for casualbasic trades here i cant breed for or should i move to rcasualpokemontrades i checked it out but there too are people asking for shinies or perfect mons
pokemontrades,not_removed,anyone have meowth or arceus codes north america ok sorry
pokemontrades,not_removed,hmm guess ill just do proof for them then
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay thanks man at least that makes me feel better cuz i dont want to get banned forever
pokemontrades,not_removed,i thought it was only a few minutes
pokemontrades,not_removed,so thats gmt right or going where japan is i want to confirm but i imagine it is that as well for na codes
pokemontrades,not_removed,excellent thank you
pokemontrades,not_removed,haha more like
pokemontrades,not_removed,lol tldr i would if i could
pokemontrades,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikixyzaffair s also politicalz
pokemontrades,not_removed,so everyone in europe gets one free darkrai and more if they reset
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah ha thanks for the reply
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks i dont have a pal console so i dont really know the details of all of the codes
pokemontrades,not_removed,haha maybe if i wasnt a massive hoarder xd i just checked and i traded for around codes i used of those to complete routes a and b so i had around scraps left over which equates to eevees plus an eevee i got for free today females from eevees aint bad at all my eevee breeding is much worse than that xd my greatest ever luck is getting that female birthday sylveon from uandrewlay i thought it was female locked but apparently theres a chance nowadays i keep seeing male birthday mons so maybe its true
pokemontrades,not_removed,well only na are listed and thats really undeterminable too i think pika put it there as a caution and the scrap ones end soon though
pokemontrades,not_removed,its usually a few weeks after the competition keep an eye out on the sub there will likely be an announcement
pokemontrades,not_removed,it is am in jpn so my guess is yes
pokemontrades,not_removed,wahaha suddenly i just can imagine somebody whos on the code entry screen waiting for giveaways to happen
pokemontrades,not_removed,audino shrug
pokemontrades,not_removed,hasty or naive can also work in ways personally if i had acquired instead of id have sred timid jolly and hasty
pokemontrades,not_removed,most of them will probably be givenaway on svexchange if they dont come out right em iv timid gastly female being chain bred for them shinys
pokemontrades,not_removed,japan got another one in for x and y
pokemontrades,not_removed,there was one event in japan where victini had vcreate blue flare bolt strike and glaciate
pokemontrades,not_removed,reset your game and bank the event
pokemontrades,not_removed,reset your game receive the gift play the game until you reach the first pokecenter take gift from delivery girl use pokebank to store the gift reset then you could bring all your banked pokemon over to your main file
pokemontrades,not_removed,the day is almost always the first day of the event sometimes it just takes awhile to add it if youre really concerned pick a day far away like in december if youre really really concerned change the year
pokemontrades,not_removed,yep thats what i did too
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont know sorry you should take pic proof or video proof
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks but i dont have a na or pal console i saw your post from yesterdays ddt how many are you left with lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,im so sorry is it your main file did you store anything in pokemon bank my friend lost his save with boxes of event pokemon including boxes of shiny jirachis when he was farming rayquazas
pokemontrades,not_removed,maybe you can recover the pokemon used in those battles im not sure though
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh nice i hope the rebuilding process is a smooth one
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah we do casual trades here too but the posts are getting buried alive these few days the top threads these few days are mostly eventsgiveawaysredeem requests because a lot of codes are expiring today once the commotion dies down the casual trade posts will become noticeable again
pokemontrades,not_removed,just put up a casual trade thread here to be honest if you dont need ha or ivs you should have no problem getting them i would help but i wont be home for like twelve hours i am surprised that you are having problems with gts are you depositing deposits of a bred starter for another starter should go fast
pokemontrades,not_removed,try again in a couple of hours just in case it comes back early dont worry there will be more chances to get a darkrai code after the newsletter darkrai comes out
pokemontrades,not_removed,i had it before and it def lasted longer than minutes
pokemontrades,not_removed,i would assume it is based off the region where the codes are valid jst should have nothing to do with na codes no positive about any of this i am not a time lord
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea its equivalent to a wifi event and after the maxsoft redistribution its just way too much dank imo
pokemontrades,not_removed,haha maybe if i wasnt around i wasnt a massive hoarder xd cant blame you i hoard eevee but just eevee p i just checked and i traded for around codes i used of those to complete routes a and b so i had around scraps left over which equates to eevees plus an eevee i got for free today can i at least have a male kidding but if you ever make a thread trading them i will probably be the first to post a spreadsheet females from eevees aint bad at all my eevee breeding is much worse than that xd i guess not i have fairly good female eevee breeding usually out of are female though my greatest ever luck is getting that female birthday sylveon from uandrewlay i thought it was female locked but apparently theres a chance nowadays i keep seeing male birthday mons so maybe its true according to serbii the first distro is male only second is male or female that could be wrong though
pokemontrades,not_removed,will do thank you
pokemontrades,not_removed,evil grin and handlebar mustache included
pokemontrades,not_removed,cringes
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay ill do hasty instead of adamant thanks for your input
pokemontrades,not_removed,ahh i get ya
pokemontrades,not_removed,i forget everything that japan gets i think ours was cooler due to those signature moves though if the one you are referring to doesnt happen to have them as well if it does then please do carry on with the japan event hate
pokemontrades,not_removed,well fuck i forgot about that one damn it mushy dont remind me
pokemontrades,not_removed,so get the event put it in your boxes move it to bank reset game file and is there a certain point in the game you have to get up to before you can get another
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright
pokemontrades,not_removed,no idea but definitely i had got language set so i will release them into the wild later
pokemontrades,not_removed,it was my main file i was resetting my x and yeah both cards are blue
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah whatever im so fucking sad ill just quit pokemon sorry for those traders here
pokemontrades,not_removed,well i already got multiple offer from people here wanting to help me its just amazing
pokemontrades,not_removed,okay i will post later thank you
pokemontrades,not_removed,im flying home today anyway so im in no rush but yeah my gts deposits are not being taken or maybe im just impatient i deposited a charmander and requested a bulbasaur any level and its still up after
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah i see ive never experienced it before but ive seen people who get locked out during those giveaways where you have to figure out a numberletter from a code
pokemontrades,not_removed,i will probably trade the males yeah dont have much use for them just gonna hang onto them until theyre a bit more valuable xd oh yeah pretty sure that particular info is wrong unless andrew is a crazy hacker before gen hacking became mainstream last i checked some of the gender options were wrong i pointed out the ones i knew were wrong but i forgot to check if they were fixed or not
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i know theyre the pal ones e i get it and i think it was rather nice of you im just not sure that theyre expiring in a few hours
pokemontrades,not_removed,maybe p
pokemontrades,not_removed,hello sorry but this thread isnt for trading please make a trade thread on the subreddit instead thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,japan shakes fist
pokemontrades,not_removed,i know all we got was lame ass fusion flarebolt
pokemontrades,not_removed,you need to get the dex to be able to use pokébank so play until you get the dex after the first rival battle then redeem sr for nature if you want bank the mon reset the save repeat
pokemontrades,not_removed,damn thats a lot xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah surprised that doesnt shift honestly just put a casual trade up here then people will help you out
pokemontrades,not_removed,thats actually how i got locked out lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,i know they get some things wrong for example happy meowth was listed as male only for a while and i kinda freaked when i got a female before this was changed
pokemontrades,not_removed,stop exploiting me i rigged the redemption screen and i printed the birthday card and the crown
pokemontrades,not_removed,according to the distribution guide theyll expire in a month o
pokemontrades,not_removed,how is that a maybe d not sure what else you could do with two lang sets of meowth with my name on em ive spent the last hour trying to think up a new team to build kinda want it to have a theme competitive viability is void any recommendations
pokemontrades,not_removed,they had another one as well im told that one was a really nice event due to it having the three moves i mentioned but also glaciate so they got the cooler version i knew about the scrap one but didnt care about the moves so i didnt know it had vcreate as well i had completely forgotten about the other one i was just told about though
pokemontrades,not_removed,gotta admit that it was still a cool wifi but yeah no where near the level of the glaciate one
pokemontrades,not_removed,for sring for nature do you save just before you receive it check the nature and if its not the one you want reset the game also do you know the button combo to soft reset
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea i know i dread so much as i count them
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah please
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah its tough because its nigh impossible to check genders unless you find somebody whos got one i was browsing a moment ago and im kind of tired but i seem to recall worlds sharpedo is locked to female or maybe im getting confused with worlds aegislash if you can find a male one feel free to let me know xd oh heres one thats definitely wrong vgc pachi is locked to female but serebii says its locked to male ill message joe when ive woke up tomorrow
pokemontrades,not_removed,cools i want to find a na set somewhere to sr myself or a cheap pal console
pokemontrades,not_removed,monotype teams they are fun if you do it with your favorite type or with your least favorite type imo
pokemontrades,not_removed,have you considered running a team with slowking i used to run a team with lucario tyrantrum hawlucha but really idk p
pokemontrades,not_removed,to sr for nature you save in front of the delivery lady at the pokémon center you already received the mon through mystery gift then claim the mon and check the nature yes sr its lrstartselect to reset the save its down b x in the title screen
pokemontrades,not_removed,i still need to redeem my mew codes p and like darkrai codes might just give the dankrai away
pokemontrades,not_removed,both sharpedo and aegi were locked to female p
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah true audino ask she has quite a few i think probably at least one was male if so i think ive seen male aegi offered here but maybe not yup tell him a random stranger said hi
pokemontrades,not_removed,considering a poisontype mono but i dunno i like variety a lot
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have considered slowbro before actually with one mega as the boss problem is battlespots dupes clause trying very hard to steer away from using lucario again hes been my ace for far too many battles when i was starting out on showdown used to run him with baton shedinja but thats banned now thought of this now an avatar tla team
pokemontrades,not_removed,alright thanks for your help
pokemontrades,not_removed,i will make a giveaway thread now
pokemontrades,not_removed,aegi is locked to female
pokemontrades,not_removed,just give it go try battling on showdown with it first and then maybe on cart there is a youtuber called pimpnite i think its this name that does battles with theme teams maybe take a look at his channel
pokemontrades,not_removed,so what is your progress with the shinies p
pokemontrades,not_removed,typing all those codes will be a pain lol
pokemontrades,not_removed,hmm well at least you could provide some information uvincentasm comment reply daily discussion question thread for august from via rpokemontrades sent just now aegi is locked to female
pokemontrades,not_removed,hmm what information i also replied to vincentasm as well p
pokemontrades,not_removed,that its female locked meh he can get it lots of times shrug also i was right to use she correct i kinda assumed based on the username which i try to avoid
pokemontrades,not_removed,yep yep i am indeed a female you too right just guessing based on the trainer id
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah i dont think anyone else used may as their ign on x and y haha its my real name so if you use that ill also respond to that and to violet but i dont like being called that though some people here use it edit also if youre wondering i have no choice but to respond as people have gone to the point of putting violet on proofs to annoy me
pokemontrades,not_removed,i could trade you a male and female breeding pair is your lucky egg available
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey i have a bunch of breedjects ha gibles i can trade for that mareanie

pokemontrades,not_removed,alright
pokemontrades,not_removed,no thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey man i have a self obtained alexander hoopa i should have one with hasty nature comes with photo proof of the redemption im interested in a celebi with timid nature for the picture of the wondercard could you also have a note with both our usernames and the date on it
pokemontrades,not_removed,what would you be willing to trade for a spare shaymincelebi i missed the first half of the year of events and just caught victini before it expired im hitting myself for missing out on them
pokemontrades,not_removed,um i wan wondering if you would be interested in trading a sr jirachi for some custom shinies off my breedables list i can do it using svexchange if you are interested
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have a selfobtained timid manaphy would you be willing to sr for a timid keldeo with hp electric
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey there sure just gimme some time to sr it for the nature been doing it just now and ive been getting calm and modest
pokemontrades,not_removed,hmm not really sure all im looking for is just the manaphy that i missed out on and with the trader below he just took my last celebi that i could sr on what do you have to offer though
pokemontrades,not_removed,unfortunately not at the moment as im eagerly trying to find another user that can either sr or already own a timid manaphy
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey there err i would most likely prefer to sr for the nature since hp is all gonna be luck as its quite difficult to get a specific one
pokemontrades,not_removed,heres the proof for the hasty hoopa httpimgurcomakragy sorry about making you sr for nature
pokemontrades,not_removed,keldeo volcanions darkrais arceus genesects meloettas all my events were self obtained on my oras and xy simply just redeemed and stored them in my bank i unfortunately only have wc for the meloettas one volcanion and a genesect as i reset my games to redeem more codes as such i unfortunately have no proof other than my word they are untouched i also have one of each in my living dex with a different nature so if you ask i can check those for a shaymin id be willing to do on any or volcanion darkrai genesect
pokemontrades,not_removed,i can certainly understand your reluctance would it help tip the balance if i threw in an extra mon eg a selfobtained compnatured arceus
pokemontrades,not_removed,lol no worries its taking a while though i might have to do it at an later hour after im done with classes and stuff heres my wc httpimgurcomalarqrd for it could we trade in gen edit lol nvm i just got it the moment i made this comment
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah unfortunately i already own those event mons you just mentioned
pokemontrades,not_removed,mm it might change my mind depending on the mon because i already have most of the mons and the other downloadable events and im just only looking for the manaphy that i missed out on dont really have an interest in old events and shinies for the time being too
pokemontrades,not_removed,yeah gen is fine im online now are you available to trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,thats fine thank you anyways
pokemontrades,not_removed,would an arceus suffice or do you have another mon in mind
pokemontrades,not_removed,yep adding your fc now
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you for the trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have plenty arceus on my side so ill pass on that perhaps you have a list that i could check out
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks for the trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,i still dont have my stuff in a google sheet or anything but ill tell you whatever i can other than comp natured meloettahelen volcanion most of my spares are comp natured ingame legendaries and some pokebank events i also have a noncomp celebi that i picked up from
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah in that case i would wait for a completed google spreadsheet that i can check out because i still feel really reluctant to sr for hp as i still dont find anything that fancies me ill be making another post just to use up my hour post rule so we can continue our conversation from there if youd like
pokemontrades,not_removed,what are your rate in the events for trade intreted in pgl lando pgl miltank and gamestop dragonite

pokemontrades,not_removed,do you happen to know what form a vivillon captured in your game is
pokemontrades,not_removed,diancie someone traded to me in public hello if you obtained this diancie from a passerby trade wonder trade or the gts it cannot be traded here such pokémon are always heavily hackedcloned
pokemontrades,not_removed,wait i go capture one will update u soon
pokemontrades,not_removed,icy snow
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh sorry johto trio with hidden ability i got from pokebank event
pokemontrades,not_removed,may i know how i can identify hacked or cloned pokemon
pokemontrades,not_removed,give me a bit to breed you one fossils take forever and ill trade it for icy snow vivillon
pokemontrades,not_removed,outside of the obvious illegal characteristics a rule of thumb is that anything valuable from the gtswtpasserby trades is going to be hackedcloned pokémon originating from other subredditsforums that are more lenient about legitimacy also tend to be cloned
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanksi will wait 😀
pokemontrades,not_removed,is a relaxed nature okay i can do jolly or adamant but it will take longer

pokemontrades,not_removed,closed
pokemontrades,not_removed,about the dittos youre asking for im pretty sure gen is different from gen regarding languages for mm youd need a nonna region ds and cart also ha dittos is done with hidden grotto rng and is much more difficult to rng than in bw with the stupid the whole thing would be a pretty tall order imho not to mention replaying the entire game for the ot munchlax pichu would be gen oneinamillion breeding you could technically rng them for shininess stats and moves but the pokeball isnt inherited in gen breeding
pokemontrades,not_removed,would this interest you pokemon nature ability stats ot id tsv pichu f adamant lightning rod volt tackle encore wish fake out justin in a heal ball though
pokemontrades,not_removed,replaying the entire game for the ot are there no emulators for pretty tall order im not asking anyone to fill out the whole order at once oneinamillion breeding from what i hear more like in ish in for shiny tsv match pokeball isnt inherited in gen breeding i am requesting an rng wild catch are you offering a trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh my goodness yes d what would you like for it p
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey eraco what would you like for pichu
pokemontrades,not_removed,are there no emulators for there are so many i could have one on my iphone if i wanted to it wouldnt be legal but i could
pokemontrades,not_removed,scraps jade delibird would be what interests me in that order your thoughts
pokemontrades,not_removed,try going to rbreedingdittos if you havent they give free ditto
pokemontrades,not_removed,if you have facebook search pokemon trading on that youll get a free one for joining a group with no requirements
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry to say but this subreddit is for legitimate trading and unhacked iv dittos are incredibly rare id recommend looking into another subreddit there are a few out there but im not sure if im allowed to tell you
pokemontrades,not_removed,unfortunately i messed up their formatting so i have been locked out of that for a week
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks i found the group you were a huge help
pokemontrades,not_removed,is there a thread for rng ditto because i heard that those ones are legitimate i was unsure if this was a good place to try to find a trade so i asked in the questions thread
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh goodluck anyway for your ditto hunting
pokemontrades,not_removed,how long did it take to get your ditto may i ask
pokemontrades,not_removed,what does rng mean
pokemontrades,not_removed,still waiting to be added to group but i found it
pokemontrades,not_removed,random number generator basically gen and previous games didnt offer truly random pokemon with random encounters you could enter information into a pokemon generator and see when a perfect pokemon would spawn or a shiny would be generated the game spawns the pokemon so it is considered unhacked but it is rather dubious since you are seeing things that was never intended
pokemontrades,not_removed,any news on how long it took to give you the ditto
pokemontrades,not_removed,idk of any rng threads but there is subreddit in particular rbreedingdittos that i would recommend however if youre thinking of playing in any tournaments unlikely i know then breeding with a ditto like this will make its offspring illegal
pokemontrades,not_removed,got some news you leave a post and put a pokemon on the gts they should get around to you eventually its a closed group so i got in about an hour ago
pokemontrades,not_removed,it shouldnt make the offspring illegal to my knowledge
pokemontrades,not_removed,if you are thinking of playing in any tournaments they are considered illegal
pokemontrades,not_removed,an rng pokemon is spawned entirely in game it doesnt alter code at all
pokemontrades,not_removed,im talkin about pokemon bred with a rbreedingdittos ditto
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have iv ha amaura hawlucha and a female noibat in a dusk ball for trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,i can give you a totodile aron corphish and gible for one all male and ha except aron

pokemontrades,not_removed,hi i have a ha zapdos and moltres code i can also redeem if you want interested in events do they come with proof
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have a ha bird set self redeemed with video proof
pokemontrades,not_removed,i have an aldora bird set for trade video proof redeemed for me by leonzz and i would add an na arceus code as well for your events
pokemontrades,not_removed,i can give you a code set of all ha aldora birds if youd like
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi i can give you all aldora birds selfobtained with proof im interested in the three events of shiny dialga palkia and giratina
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi depends on your proof preferences i can show wonder cards but seeing as the dragons are in my omega ruby id be happy to show u their summary ingame cuz i have old proof of that but i could take new wonder card pics as updated proof if anything since i thought i restarted my white version but thankfully i didnt i can also take new pics if old proof doesnt hold up these were taken for a different user who changed their mind here are the links dialga httpimgurcomayfvgs dialga httpimgurcomahujer palkia httpimgurcomamopra palkia giratina giratina links can also be found here as well as the username listed in the pics
pokemontrades,not_removed,hi please remember to either list the ot or list the specific distribution your bird set is
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey nice to hear from u again sry i didnt reply to u first i just traded one of each dragon and have only mild dialga mild palkia and timid giratina left could i see the video proof i just asked a couple of other ppl that replied for proof so i dont intend to ignore anyone
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey do u still have those codes also do u have proof that they are still redeemable i just finished trading of each dragon and while im asking one person for proof of iv spreads for the already redeemed i dont mind picking up one more of each code including articuno
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey im sorry i didnt reply to u first i was more intrested in codes than already redeemed birds do u have proof on hand i just finished trading of each dragon im curious of the natures and ivs u redeemed
pokemontrades,not_removed,i am interested in a set that has wondercard proof how many would you give for the two birds i can add stuff from as well edit mostly interested in dialga palkia and giratina
pokemontrades,not_removed,its the pal one ot aldora
pokemontrades,not_removed,yea let me see if i can find the link
pokemontrades,not_removed,this are my birds aldora articuno nature gentle aldora zapdos nature naive aldora moltres nature adamant i dont know now ivs becouse im not at home
pokemontrades,not_removed,hk shiny jirachi sounds good if thats ok ima begin taking pics of wonder card proof for my black white versions
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks
pokemontrades,not_removed,hey were u by any chance the person that deleted their post reply just wanna make sure no one is ignored in this thread
pokemontrades,not_removed,cool no rush
pokemontrades,not_removed,thank you when it comes to ivs i can wait for that info
pokemontrades,not_removed,hk shiny jirachi is nft same with all jirachis is there anything else i can interest you in maybe yveltal codes
pokemontrades,not_removed,that was by a mod since i didnt specify which birds i redeemed
pokemontrades,not_removed,sent via pm were these the events that had no proof
pokemontrades,not_removed,i saw some other stuff like that shiny hooh but do u have extra articuno zapdos and moltres codes or just of each id go for of each if its not too much
pokemontrades,not_removed,oh i see happened to me earlier when i first posted because i forgot to put xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes glad to see u found the proof could i ask what natures and ivs u have on them
pokemontrades,not_removed,i dont have of each im afraid turns out my newsletter ones had expired i have zapdos code and moltres codes if that would work i can throw in two yveltal codes as well they are worth more than bird codes so maybe you can trade them for some they are redeemable until december
pokemontrades,not_removed,its all good we all forget let me know if you rejectaccept my offer
pokemontrades,not_removed,
pokemontrades,not_removed,ok took some time to look thru the msgs but u want dialga palkia and giratina for zapdos code moltres codes and yveltal codes if i could modify the trade id say i can do dialga palkia and giratina for zapdos code moltres codes and maybe yveltal code and xerneas code if u still have left
pokemontrades,not_removed,cool u said u have video proof do u have a link u could kindly share
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks it shows natures but not ivs i said stats when i shoulda said ivs oh and i noticed the arceus under anniversary events both show shaymins movesets thought id help n let u know
pokemontrades,not_removed,yes thats correct i dont have any xerneas codes left but i could throw in a comp shiny aegislash if that would help
pokemontrades,not_removed,wait i think you misunderstood what i wanted haha i meant the first dialga on the list the first palkia on the list and the second giratina on the list i did not mean that i wanted giratinas sorry for not noticing until now in other words i wanted the modest dialga timid palkia and the adamant giratina
pokemontrades,not_removed,sent you the proof they were originally for another user but i accidentally redeemed it on a wrong date so they let me keep theses birds and i replaced their codes and redeemed those codes too
pokemontrades,not_removed,uhhh i would have to check the ivs they are nothing special
pokemontrades,not_removed,hmmm not interested in aegislash but u could redeem them for me zapdos timid and moltres timid im awfully specific when it comes to ivs to the point id be asking for competitive spreads is that ok if yes then i would trade dialga palkia and giratina for redeemed zapdos and redeemed moltres and moltres code also i would kindly like to provide video proof of the wonder cards im gonna see if i can upload to my youtube account
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah ok i did use and to tell them apart after all xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks i got the proof ima take a look very kind of them to let u keep them
pokemontrades,not_removed,thnx but if u simply put down the lv stats i can determine them myself i tried to catch good ones in the past
pokemontrades,not_removed,i wouldnt want to do comp softresets im sorry i dont even have the patience to do that for myself haha though i can give you the zapdos code moltres codes and yveltal codes for your three pokemon also for the proof if you can take a picture of the wondercards with my name and your name that would be perfect
pokemontrades,not_removed,ah sounds like a deal but would u still do soft resets for timid zapdos and timid moltres with spreads like this if yes then u got yourself a deal
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry i dont have time to do that kind of sr im afraid i just sr for natures with my own ones without iv placement would you still like to do the trade i saw that the guy who will redeem the articuno code for you also said he could redeem zapdos and moltres
pokemontrades,not_removed,very understandable u got yourself a deal just gimme a few min to get the wonder card proof ready ill take pics
pokemontrades,not_removed,great sure thing im in a trade at the moment anyways so take your time i will add you as soon as im done with this trade
pokemontrades,not_removed,sorry for the delay but i am ready starting now
pokemontrades,not_removed,awesome timing heres the link to the wc proof could u also kindly provide proof that the codes are in fact redeemable i spoke to someone today who got scammed and got an already redeemed moltres code and im considering spotting them one of urs
pokemontrades,not_removed,looking good i have the yveltal codes in physical form so i am certain they are legit i also tested the moltres and zapdos codes like an hour ago so they are also working ill go online now
pokemontrades,not_removed,cool see u online in a min edit sry i took so long almost added u on the wrong xd
pokemontrades,not_removed,thanks a lot for the trade i sent the codes via pm please confirm when you have tested them
