socialism,removed,so what caesars legion rapes rainbow dash or something
socialism,removed,one of the bus men called me the wrong pronouns i prefer jewjewjews and i schwitzed out of my tuchus so hard its running out of my burgundy sweatpants
socialism,removed,workers are revolutionaries not insurrectionists
socialism,removed,revolutions unions strikes and worker solidarity insurrection individuals with guns take power only one is in the interests of workers
socialism,removed,hey babe
socialism,removed,because i want to organise actual workers not dress up in cosplay leave all that nonsense to the anarchists
socialism,removed,so you dont believe in a worker revolution are you an anarchist
socialism,removed,lmao
socialism,removed,nonbias research done to show correlations between political ideologies and intelligence is deemed stupid and then you ask others to refute arguments for you how mature there is nothing to refute these are observations and everything is i said is predicated upon history and statistics im sure someone will come in here and respond to me but i no longer have the time to waste debating with infantile imbeciles and fools i have work to do unlike yourselves grow up
socialism,removed,ahahahahhabahahahahaha yes wait for hours on end instead of getting a job
socialism,removed,because obviously theres no such thing as gay pedophiles right
socialism,removed,rojava is comprised of xenophobes homophobes racists and murderers my friend whom is black was refused by disgusting racist kurds lions of rojava group from helping back in even daesh is more racially accepting than these worthless kurds kurds think theyre above black people and homosexuals i think theyre not and encourage all of you to vote with your money against them
socialism,removed,this is definitely unsavory at best but it annoys me that the guardian is using a picture of trayvon martin from when he was a prepubescent cmon its not like zimmerman gunned down a defenseless smiling old
socialism,removed,do you have a link to the auction
socialism,removed,i actually really want this guy to fucking die what an absolute cunt
socialism,removed,cunt
socialism,removed,more bullsht the for george zimmerman the alleged trayvon martin shooter is the same person as the attorney for the alleged batman massacre shooter
socialism,removed,intensifies
socialism,removed,are you serious i dont give a fuck about internet points thats why im trolling you censoring insecure idiots because you might as well be trump supporters at this point
socialism,removed,nobody took me serious from the start apparently advocating freedom of expression makes you a troll in the eyes of this subreddit only after everything i said even comments agreeing with people were being downvoted indiscriminately to hide them below the threshold did i start stirring shit which is still better than advocating throwing punches and bricks at people who havent done anything yet you can rationalize it as i think im some master troll lel or whatever the hell you want im doing it because if im not going to get even a modicum of respect in this thread and be censored for advocating basic freedoms then i dont owe any of them any respect either and think theyre worthy of active contempt
socialism,removed,i dont care enough to read or respond to any of this anymore thankfully everyone here seems to realize how stupid your position is so we can just leave it at that sorry youve been censored s
socialism,removed,totally what i advocated s goddamn are you actually retarded because it seems to be either that or youre purposefully misrepresenting me to the point of absurdity
socialism,removed,imagine if you received hate from many people from all directions imagine if a large movement was built on the idea you should be killed those movements already exist these fascist neonazis being one of them since im trans and bi does it frustrate and confuse me that people could be so ignorant and willingly hateful towards their fellow human beings absolutely but does is harm my mental health no more than any other lunatic ideas like racism and sexism and all the other isms do these have the potential to harm people mentally sure but then again so does pretty much everything in the right circumstances theres no rational limit to what constitutes harmful speech if you carry that to its logical conclusion never mind actually allowing fascists into power to let them do those things im not really sure how allowing them to express their insane ideas guarantees them power can you elaborate on that i could say the moon is purple but theres no implicit guarantee that people will or wont listen to me i believe the free sharing of ideas is essential to a functioning democracy
socialism,removed,god i thought i believed in conspiracies but that one takes the cake so why cant the same logic be used to censor our message then free speech is freedom to say the most beautiful and intelligent as well as the most ugly hateful and ignorant things it just doesnt work otherwise because any standard of censorship above threats and inciting direct violence like yelling fire in a crowded building are arbitrary and subjective and can just as easily be used to censor what you like as well as what you hate
socialism,removed,its not a slur if its a genuine question and i swear to you it was genuine if you think thats what im advocating then i see no other alternative possibilities than youre literally mentally retarded and couldnt process what ive said or youre deliberately strawmanning my position
socialism,removed,the same thing happened at a candlelight vigil at mizzou for orlando victims dont blame them they are just niggers you cant expect them to behave
socialism,removed,looks like we know whos getting sent to the gulags
socialism,removed,wow just wow your so stupid im not even gonna bother explaining it to you cause u wont understand it
socialism,removed,if rsocialism supports him then i know im against him its always about the wealth gap with socialists they would rather the poor be poorer so long as the rich are less rich a socialist by definition has zero clue how wealth is created in a property owning democracy theyre pathetic
socialism,removed,dae bitches
socialism,removed,ahahahahhahhahaha hurt feelings report i love the utter failure at leftists to make a case for their beliefs other than make it illegal to be mean or disagree with me im so progressive i want dark ages anti thought society
socialism,removed,basically socialism being socialism
socialism,removed,ok i stole this from a front page thread for more clarification asoporific this is a longer story than im telling but yeah here we go venezuela has always had issues with corruption but its not normally this much of an issue i mean lots of countries have issued with corruption but around twenty years ago a fellow by the name of hugo chavez was elected president some years after he tried to take the job by force in a coup that obviously failed you see chavez was enamored with two things simon bolivar and the wave of revolutions that cleared the spanish from the new world and international socialism now simon bolivar was cut from much the same cloth as thomas jefferson or george washington and is really a man who deserves remembering but chavez wanted to be bolivar just swap out the spanish for the united states and bolivars liberalism for socialism at first chavez appeared to be doing a good job but the man was a bit suspicious of absolutely everyone he knew how easy it was to plot a coup and was constantly being convinced that one was brewing against him this wasnt entirely unjustified because there was one there were a lot of powerful people in the country that were unhappy with strained relations with us and eu and very close ties to cuba to the point where the nation was basically trading oil for cuban grade school textbooks and doctors the coup ousted chavez for about hours before failing because the military wouldnt back the coup and the poor of caracas came out to defend the bolivarian revolution one of the primary causes of failure was a complete lack of backing from the us and george w bushs insistence that the us not be involved this was in many ways a breaking point the man put up lead by the planners of the coup was head of the venezuelan federation of chambers of commerce in short businesses became the enemy as much as the us in the eyes of the chavista movement so even though the staterun oil company was of the nations exports its leadership was culled and replaced by political supporters of chavez the media who had not been a friend to chavez prior to the coup found itself being seized forced to close or force out of the nation altogether a number of companies tied to the coup were outright seized when the markets reacted poorly to this and the bolivar the currency of venezuela suffered price controls were put in place fixing the rate at which money can be legally exchanged for a different nations currency things didnt go great after that the price fixing made it hard to sell venezuelan made stuff outside the country hard for a while at least people managed and found local sources or tightened belts there were the occasional nationalization of a newspaper or oil platform but chavez was popular and on the ball enough to prevent things from getting worse then in chavez died everything got much worse nicolas maduro was elected by a narrow margin and he was chavezs handpicked successor not handpicked because he was as good as chavez but because he was ideologically pure and a good friend maduro is in every way a pale echo of chavez he is not as talented charismatic or skilled as his friend and mentor his inadequacy took a bad situation and made it much worse there have been periodic problems since for the first time shortages appeared on shelves in as many of the companies who had stockpiled money for imports ran out in there were massive protests and riots last year a number of airlines either stopped accepting bolivars in exchange for plane tickets or abandoned their routs to the country altogether because they couldnt buy the things they needed there and the state wouldnt let them convert bolivars into dollars there were no resolutions to any of these problems instead the police and military were able to restore order either by seizing the offending business and turning it over to more ideologically pure supporters of the government or by clearing the streets of protestors the last independent news broadcasters were also forced out meaning that the only news is that the government is producing itself what has happened here is the fact that his coke subsidiary has run out of dollars with which to buy sugar normally this isnt much of a problem in that the company can simply go to the bank and change local currencies bolivars for the currency to buy imports us dollars only because the price controls the banks dont have any dollars the only export of any note that can bring in dollars is oil which is controlled by the government the problem is that the global price of oil has fallen by more than half and at the same time oil production has faltered under mismanagement and corruption on the part of those political appointees so the government just doesnt have the dollars to trade to the coke bottler to buy sugar the coke subsidiary simply cannot function and has announced as such this is the same thing that happened to the clorox plant beer manufacturer and that consumer electronics chain last year the coke subsidiary will most likely be seized by maduro and forced to open but still fail to produce output because they cant make anything without sugar coke as a company prides itself on being literally everywhere theyre in china and were in russia towards the end of the soviet union when world war ii happened they built portable bottling plants and shipped them around the south pacific following us marines to ensure that they could always get a coke in terms of prevalence and hardiness coke is the cockroach of the business world its always there it survives just about anything when coke cant take it youre talking apocalypse level disaster thats actually pretty much where we are now in venezuela there was already a coup and hundreds of thousands protesting for months the party of chavez and maduro were already voted out of power but are using emergency laws to maintain their positions theres no democratic or undemocratic process left for the average person to try to fix things other than burn it downstart from scratch if maduro was smart he would step down in favor of someone more capable and willing to compromise but if maduro was smart it wouldnt have gotten this far in the first place
socialism,removed,socialism when it works its socialism when it doesnt it isnt socialism amirite
socialism,removed,that whole social ownership never made any sense to me what would the whole country know about running microsoft or the company that makes the widgets inside the transmissions of heavy machinery the only example of workerowned anything are industries where the workers share a passion for the final product such as breweries bakeries handmade furniture etc most industries are complicated and mundane and driven by profit only i can see workers coops and its a good thing but i dont see how it can ever control more than percent of the pie
socialism,removed,please venezuela my homeland has been a disaster due to atrocious levels of corruption at the top chavez sold out in and the country began to disintegrate maduro is finishing the job he is basically a dictator as was chavez and lives opulently while the rest of the nation starves venezuela must kill chavismo before it finishes killing her this is not socialism it is a communist dictatorship and before you get your panties in a bunch i am a democratic socialist
socialism,removed,why hes a criminal whos strong arm robbed a store for cigars before being killed he isnt much of a hero
socialism,removed,socialism works
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,this shit is exactly the reason why so many people all over the world despise leftwingers because they really like to meddle with fascist movements like blm and alleged criminals like mike brown
socialism,removed,this is reactionary bullshit look how well you described your own comment every cop is a pig all evidence which supports cops is rigged youre doing the socialist cause a disservice with every onesided ignorant rant you post
socialism,removed,if this bully thug is now the face of socialism count me out lets not pretend he assaulted a shop worker stole cigars for the proletariat cause thats not to say institutional racism is not a problem but not everyone killed in a confrontation with police is a socialist hero theres snake oil salesmen in this subreddit just like any other proof of which can be found in lowinfo shitposts like this
socialism,removed,ctr please go were not obligated to vote for your neoliberal warmonger of a candidate when did i endorse clinton in the slightest shes a warmongering criminal who might keel over at any moment kindly go back to pol
socialism,removed,this unfortunate race whom we had been taking so much pains to save and to civilize have by their unexpected desertion and ferocious barbarities justified extermination and now await our decision on their fate
socialism,removed,hahahahahahahaahahaahahaa get fucked buddy were winning and there is nothing you can do about it how does it feel watching your dreams slip away before you how does it feel knowing that the alt right is rising and all you can do is sit and watch how does it feel going oh man it must suck and it must eat you up get owned son maga deport every last cuck ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
socialism,removed,wow you guys are just mad because you have lazy parents who didnt leave you with billions lazy bastards
socialism,removed,i havent been a trump supporter although compared to hillary he has less blood on his hands but when i see trump supporters attend a trump speech and get assaulted and nearly murdered it becomes more clear everyday that even if i dont like trump we need trump to be president just to counteract the violent extremists in this country who are against democratic and republic values
socialism,removed,it wont solve anything its completely selfdefeating all it will do is galvanise his supporters and convince them that hes under attack its a propaganda victory for him
socialism,removed,ok so socialists believe its ok to attack anyone who doesnt agree with them well ill agree with you and beat up the next socialist i meet
socialism,removed,i didnt necessarily condemn them though i find people encouraging this violence absurd it wont do anything its not going to make any trump supporters go home think about what theyve done and change their mind on him it will attract new supporters if anything we should be looking to target trump supporters with ideas a large part of his base is white working class people and hes proved popular among them by tapping into their basest fears and prejudices many of them are clearly disaffected with neoliberal capitalism but have been fooled by trump into believing he has a solution for it he doesnt of course but we do and we should be showing that
socialism,removed,trump supporters are exercising their freedom in a democracy and they probably have guns if they dont have guns if shit keeps getting more violent they will escalate too stop being a fascist and go win the argument dont try to silence the debate
socialism,removed,stay triggered niggerlovers trump will get into the white house and you can fuck right off to canada
socialism,removed,seriously how sick in the mind are you equating going to support your candidate to stopping murder and conspiracy to commit murder how fucking retarded are you
socialism,removed,kill yourself what world do you live in
socialism,removed,wrong lol
socialism,removed,lying fuck
socialism,removed,saying we should ban illegals means you deserve violence fuck off
socialism,removed,wrong pussy youre a piece of shit both of you
socialism,removed,they said things that hurt our feelings lets go and kick their asses
socialism,removed,you guys have no idea what you are getting yourselves in to we are waiting for the perfect time keep up the dumb shit you idiots
socialism,removed,i cant wait to kill some fucking socialist subhumans bring it on you fucking faggots
socialism,removed,no it isnt are you retarded besides trump is not fascist there is no evidence that supports he is he is also not a racist why do you support impulsive voilent actions twards others that have a different opinion than you i know for a damn certain that i want to be around a group that is calm and rational instead of a group that cant handle other opinions than its own ie you rbabscrusade
socialism,removed,they already have backing of the state gee that explains why the cops didnt get involved and why the mayor of san jose blamed trumps big mean words for the violence instead of the protesters
socialism,removed,how would you like a free helicopter ride
socialism,removed,every now and again on this subreddit you get threads where people ask how did you find socialism or something like that the amount of people who were once reactionaries or right wing but were won over never ceases to amaze me the same thing can happen with many trump supporters but beating them off the streets will not help us
socialism,removed,i would have no problem with unprovoked violence at anyone supporting trumps campaign if someone were to have trump removed it would be nothing short of protecting our nation it would be an act of war against tyranny
socialism,removed,you are the real fascist you cunt
socialism,removed,you cunts are the real fascists stay mad you fucking parasites trump is going to make america great again and theres nothing you fucking worms can do about it hahahahaha your time is almost up you fucking pathetic creatures
socialism,removed,i bet if you are a teenage hetero dude or lesbian though you dream of bending her over in a stall next to a pony and making her gasp in pleasure
socialism,removed,so as long as someone is a fascist they can be killed with impunity never mind the fact that socialists can never define fascism they will just declare anyone who raises a dissenting opinion a fascist and magically it becomes morally acceptable to kill them
socialism,removed,ok serious question do you think it is justified to kill trump supporters the people in this thread obviously support permanently injuring them but what about killing every killed trump supporter is one less vote for trump
socialism,removed,bullshit as in supply and demand
socialism,removed,would someone mind going in depth about this situation opinions are fine cited neutral sources preferred i just want a better understanding of how all this happened and what can be done without bloodshed war so on
socialism,removed,my big hero said it so its only natural it might have been reasonable brevity but to me it looked religiously spooky capitalists have very strong arguments and claim that socialists are economically illiterate and acting on emotion rather than facts and logic concider that before making their assertion correct
socialism,removed,i dont doubt that this is happening to a certain degree but telesur really is worse than russia today its decent for getting turned on to stories that dont recieve much coverage but i need to research more about who they are lots of stories dont fit right even when i want them to i know a fair amount of radical folks in south america and no one ever references telesur the democracy now yes smaller local sources yep but never telesur
socialism,removed,this promaduro propaganda is really getting on my nerves do they really think that people with some knowledge about the theory behind socialism will belief that such a massive crisis with extreme inflation rates exploding crime and deflating oil rent was manufactured by the bourgeoisie
socialism,removed,i sure as fuck dont although i despise the soviet union in general giving all of the means of production to the state isnt the way to run things and how the fuck was the state supposed to wither away when the state was ridiculously powerful more so than before the revolution socialism has to be libertarian or it can never be done authoritarian socialism had its chance in the century and look where it is now authoritarian socialism will never lead to full communism
socialism,removed,if being sectarian means opposing gulags state ownership of the means of production and death squads then yes im a sectarian
socialism,removed,im just really sick of people who think leninismmaoism is an effective ideology
socialism,removed,yeah because the vc gave out so much freedom justice and equality after the fall of saigon
socialism,removed,the chinese were sending their cronies to manipulate the vc and to murder countless dissenters
socialism,removed,neither american or vc war crimes were justified ignoring the fact that vc were incredibly corrupt and evil doesnt help either
socialism,removed,yeah because communism really helped vietnam huh
socialism,removed,americans were being drafted into the vietnam war this american was drafted and pulled a lot of strings to avoid deployment overseas this is the true ropeadope
socialism,removed,love the haircut on that guy with the round sunglasses
socialism,removed,you know you could make the same argument about murder right its illegal and people still do it do you think its a reason to legalize it didnt think so
socialism,removed,how so im not a right winger but i agree with them that a human life needs to be protected especially the most vulnerable ones
socialism,removed,did did you remove the original post
socialism,removed,what happens when we create a synthetic uterus and sex bots women will starve without socialism females are a net drain on society the only service is reproduction take that and the insanity is just insanity no need to be nice to our weaker batshit cousins then you get treated equally i personally cannot wait soon we will not need you
socialism,removed,wat there is a genuine discussion happening about if this sub is too much focused on gender issues and you shut it down citing its sexist nice
socialism,removed,pretty much anything said by a reddit socialist sounds like it was written by a middle schooler though so
socialism,removed,haha yeah thats because most of them understand economics
socialism,removed,the fetus inside them is not part of their body but a different organism which relies on the mother during months therefore saying that its their own body is wrong
socialism,removed,does anyone know if this is the actual number more like thousand the vast majority of polish women are against abortion so the idea that millions took part against it is ridiculous its just more bullshit propaganda and lies on reddit
socialism,removed,you mean you intentionally lied to push your agenda
socialism,removed,i wish people would pay as much attention to feeding and sheltering humans already living here as they do trying to protect unborn life imagine how that would look so the prochoice solution is to kill the humans how about we dont kill unborn humans and we helped the born humans
socialism,removed,its not a separate organism because as any obstetric doctor will tell you it is a separate human organism with its own dna its own heart lungs etc are you saying that a son that a mother is carrying in her womb is the same as the mother the whole argument that life begins at conception is a bizarrely deficient way of trying to understand life in general let alone human life its the standard scientific definition its when your dna came into existence its when your life essentially started it makes sense for the rights of the potential human to scale downwards accordingly it isnt a potential human it is biologicallyscientifically human now whether it is a legal person is up to debate learn the basic of the abortion debate and the basics of science before spouting nonsense im prochoice but idiots like you spouting retarded bullshit makes all prochoice advocates look bad
socialism,removed,could i possibly rejoin ive been reading a bit more on the issues of women with regards to sexual objectification and rape culture so maybe my ban could be reconsidered
socialism,removed,why would people want forced civility and voatco are a country mile better than reddit in that regard rather than love than money than fame give me truth you can add forced civility in there for me this place will never achieve anything of note while it treats its members like infants
socialism,removed,political correctness
socialism,removed,brocialist confirmed get the truck the goli otuk will have another labourer
socialism,removed,how many people go to your football games if its not that many then i would agree with you but if its an fbs school with a popular program in the area it is probably an integral part of the community football gives the school a sense of identity and culture which draws in attention to the school of course this doesnt apply to all schools but as a whole college football should absolutely not be abolished
socialism,removed,and i came out as a firm believer of national socialism never be a skeptic
socialism,removed,i take offense that you called me a liberal also i am astounded im not autobanned from here
socialism,removed,whats up with socialists fighting for socialism from the safety of their laptops and homes that should be a testament that capitalism works that you guys are free to be indignant about anything u want with the items safety and comfort that capitalism has brought you ill get banned for this post rofl guess thats what happens when you post logic on this sub
socialism,removed,i got banned from discord for using a word beginning with d in relation to hillary supporters and cant even tell you what it was as any mention is automodded this sub is now almost pointless it can only be a hive mind under these conditions
socialism,removed,how dare you use the term walk positively some of the users here are in wheelchairs and there you are implying that walking is a desirable thing
socialism,removed,what if they say some shit like economic calculation problem hurt durr and well all lose our job if we raise the minim wage yada yafa yada does capital address that stuff
socialism,removed,i think socialism versus capitalism is a similar binary which would be better approached from a rational look at hierarchy and decentralization vast economic asymmetry virtually guarantees that workers will not get a fair shake but we should really be against any kind of build up of power which acts as a constant threat against human liberty
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,of the other left subs messaged us to ask what was going on there was a stark difference between those subs and the opportunistic and reactionary likes of ranarchism rfarleft which kept attempting in the name of free speech and democracy to get cometparty to completely destroy the sub and install them as mods to the point where they were openly collaborating with and leftypol look to me like people simply pointed that you have no transparency and that you are no democracy and that you have no particular insights into language or free speech for that matter at least be civil enough to own up to that much then go on your way as the despot you so hard what to play the despot that can not be trusted with a hammer and a nail because both require a good amount of skill to wield both now make the impossible attempt to be truly benevolent to the humans you encounter or quit your selfrighteous preaching and just go on acting with the full of petty drama as you are like the online cult of deplorables
socialism,removed,youre nothing you lost glorious hitler was in the right you are just a grasper with a feminine penis and we are coming to take your homo and tranny rights away from you then we will draft you into the military and put you on the front line to be fodder this is your future
socialism,removed,this is where its fucking beyond terrifying thinking about how advantageous another massive terrorist attack on us soil would be for trump and the greater cause of protofascism that him and his supporters overtly cherish im fucking scared as hell right now some part of me still hopes that if they really start pressing the pedal down the majority of the middle and even moderate right will fight back and say no mas that all goes out the fucking window if something unexpected and catastrophic happens i remembering intimately what did to the discourse in this country
socialism,removed,stalin did nothing wrong kulaks deserved worse
socialism,removed,so lets kill donald trump and about percent of the us
socialism,removed,except historically the nazis were httpsenwikipediaorgwikinazism so if anyone is to be compared to fascism it would be this subreddit
socialism,removed,you are as big a piece of shit as assad as far as anyone should be concerned
socialism,removed,pointing out the hypocrisy of a rich obese a selfinflicted condition person complaining about starvation especially while billions of people actually go hungry every day is not body shaming
socialism,removed,good
socialism,removed,why are there so many divided lefty parties who bicker over things nobody understands
socialism,removed,im not banned this is strange situation girl is sexually assaulted by coworker outside of work doesnt report it until later trial and proceeding are months away she has to see him a few days a week at work until then except this story takes place in a righttowork state he gets the boot
socialism,removed,making fun of someone with an injury disability deformity or any other physical characteristic that is out of their control is body shaming weight due to excess adipose tissue is totally within ones control
socialism,removed,monkeycommoditymlm shredded pork flavour point minutes ago i think the class exists so he was right about that i think he was wrong to say prostitutes are lumpen rather than proletarian i think he was wrong to say lumpen inherently tend toward counter revolutionary activity this was mostly him taking some particularities from century european upheavals and treating them as universal i think it was straight up for him to include escapes slaves as lumpen while theorizing lumpen as inherently reactionary in colonial contexts lumpen can definitely be part of the revolutionary bloc wretched of the earth by fanon is good if youre curious about this permalinkembedsaveeditdisable inbox repliesdeletereply
socialism,removed,i think we just disagree on who should be protected from shaming under antibody shaming ideals in any case it can be argued that obesity is a byproduct of capitalism as capitalists promote gluttony greed and constant consumption while spreading misinformation and pseudoscience in order to justify said behaviors at least in my country
socialism,removed,the reason for some workers resistance to immigration is that under capitalism immigration means higher competition for jobs as well as more demand on social services that the capitalist state wont fund more competition translates to more desperate people willing to undercut each others wages the bigger the pool of unemployed the easier it is for employers to undermine unions and replace troublesome workers with ones who are less likely to make a fuss immigrants often dont have families to support at the high cost of living in the western world they send money to their families who are still back in the poorer countries where the cost of living is relatively cheaper so their wages go further the only way to stop wages constantly being pushed down is for all workers to unite and refuse to undercut each other its great that aaapbp are doing well sadly sinn féin arent really socialists at all they implement austerity measures on workers in the north and will do the same down south they stand in the way of any working class progress until movements get so big that they cant ignore the issues anymore and even then they need to be pushed aside
socialism,removed,laborers candle forty two tree
socialism,removed,ah yes guevara the great murder hobo
socialism,removed,my other similar post was deleted as well httpscedditcomrsocialismnew
socialism,removed,wtf
socialism,removed,oh great a skinny nigger woman with lenin and stalin tattooed on her arms but with the sweat pants open looks really scary to me i bet she kills her babies too and laughs about it
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,if debate were an option then world war would not have happened exactly thats precisely why happened debate was not an option fascism is also such as vague label that it doesnt actually mean anything i take it that by fascism you meanauthoritarian right so if the only way to prevent fascism is to become the authoritarian left then horseshoe theory is correct and so what is the point whether your fascist leader hates the bourgeoisie or hates the other just seems like a small distinction to me
socialism,removed,as a capitalist i dont understand how socialists thing they can overcome the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiironlawofoligarchy by making an uber powerful state they will simply be making uber powerful oligarchs look at china it started out as a revolution of true believers but now they have the china today is nothing more than an authoritarian capitalist state so what was the point
socialism,removed,against not only is it distracting from the main task at hand of destroying capitalism but it is the reason why we have marginalized so much of the working class its time to stop and return to the old lefts hardliner economic discussions
socialism,removed,stuff like that makes me really happy capitalism won
socialism,removed,they call them cucks because whether wittingly or unwittingly they allow reason something that one ought to be able to manage to be ravaged by external forces viz the everchanging doublethink that is sjw klingon if your thinking is unwittingly subverted then you are a lesser cuck and pitiful but the majority of their kind demonstrate a willingness—an almost eager masochism—characteristic of one lacking vitality and the mental fortitude required for critical thinking these i would name greater cucks cucks also share something else in common with sjws as masochists they enjoy the emasculation of groupthink groupact never have to take personal responsibility or act willfully
socialism,removed,i honestly do not give a fuck about what color your skin is or who you sleep in bed with i care about material conditions and economic issues surrounding the working class i see a leftism where its incessant asshattery has led it to defeat my god have you seen how the rightwing is talking about us weve become a laughingstock for gods sake the right wing is now becoming more class conscious than us no more i can no longer support feminism because its positions have been institutionalized by the capitalists into the larger cultural hegemony of the liberal status quo emma goldman would be rolling in her grave this campaign has convinced me that idpol is nothing but drivel if you want to call me a brosocialist then go ahead the only way for feminism to revitalize itself is to return back to its roots rosa luxemburg and emma goldman were two very different people but had the same goal ending capitalism i believe that the left must return to that
socialism,removed,when your country is so free that only functions through martial law i hope to see the day that these pigs face the wall they do not deserve any better
socialism,removed,why wouldnt you just get out of the car when the cop said to
socialism,removed,what does this have to do with socialism
socialism,removed,this is horrific and please dont ban me for asking but why is this in rsocialism
socialism,removed,i dont agree with mens rights activists as a whole but i must admit that there are many double standards against men men are constantly falsely accused of rape but how often does that happen to women if you saw women wolfwhistling at men would you not consider it sexist misandry exists not on the same scale as misogyny but to an extent that it must be dealt with communism is an egalitarian ideology so we must focus on mens issues as well as womens
socialism,removed,what exactly is the difference between being otherkin and being trans
socialism,removed,funnily enough i have you tagged as a brocialist for complaining about safe spaces among other things
socialism,removed,the endless witch hunts against any deviancy from the party line is so tiring to witness socialism seems like an increasingly small and unrealistic option since all socialists seems to do split parties endlessly and call each other names on the internet altrighters unite behind trump and make an actual impact on politics and were stuck with this
socialism,removed,because all marxists wants to kill you
socialism,removed,clinical lycanthropy is the psychological term for otherkin dont know that theres an effective treatment for it but that said i have heard that suicide rates dont change before and after the effective treatment of transitioning
socialism,removed,dont know where you get that lower suicide rate after transitioning from i looked up a couple articles just now to make sure i was correct every article says suicide rates go up after transitioning but they chalk it up to external harassment which i dont doubt at any rate i guess theres nothing that i would change about the way psychologists handle it nowadays
socialism,removed,its funny because there has always been a strain in socialist thought against feminism not a misogynistic one but because feminism is for the most part liberal i would recommend the womens liberation movement in russia by stites also a lot of this identity politics for a better word is highly linked to bohemianism again something that marxists have always viewed with disdain to criticise the movement of feminism or trans or whatever is seen as a criticism of these things in themselves
socialism,removed,you are setting up a false dichotomy struggle for these oppressed groups through socialism lets say we struggle for feminism great weve got bourgeois women on the board of directors how wonderful for their proletarian sisters
socialism,removed,methinks you havent really understood the leninist creed read my post above
socialism,removed,i think people need to be more considerate of conservative views like the idea that conservatives are prolife because they think they should be able to control what women do is such a bastardization of their position they genuinely think abortion is murder and a discussion about what it means for something to be alive or a person is more constructive than insisting that theyre just sexist
socialism,removed,address all aspects of the question and give everyone your position on it nobody wants to see well it is cuz reasons or uninteresting appeals to authority
socialism,removed,since sanders is going down in flames like we all knew he would sorry naive sandernistas and democratic socialists what the condescending fuck
socialism,removed,dolphins are the vanguard of the masses humans are all counter revolutionary in all seriousness if the vanguard is based on direct democracy and instant recallablity then i support it
socialism,removed,how should we view conservatives through a scope
socialism,removed,its kind of funny to see you set so many rules for this the tighter you set the limits on discussion the less useful theyre going to be with that said however what exactly do you mean by vanguard do you mean like what lenin said in what is to be done which im given to understand he actually changed his mind on do you mean the historical example of the bolsheviks taking state power for themselves and using it to oppress the working class bourgeoisie
socialism,removed,no surprise intellectually inferior young cucks want to extort the successful this board is a meme filled with neckbeards who have zero real life or business experience so they justify they lack of their success by acting like they care about equality you dont you just dont want to be seen as the pathetic embarrassment you are
socialism,removed,fucking gdr revolution look it up asshole
socialism,removed,fuck niggers
socialism,removed,oh bullshit your parents combined income puts you distinctly in the middle class strata go fuck yourself with this i live in poverty horseshit it isnt like this is a common problem for students from low income backgrounds at elite private universities of anything haha yeah and you arent one of them based on your earlier posts you fucking liar you got into yale and you left thats not oppression thats you abdicating privileges that many others would kill for and gladly accept no matter how fucking lonely or isolated they felt what a bunch of fucking horseshit this is you make the movement look bad with this abysmal selfpity it just makes you look like someone that doesnt want to work and have things handed to them on a silver platter thats precisely what i meant by the jealousy insult earlier you are a poster child for the kind of fauxsocialist that the right wing loves to hate on so much by your logic that would make me impoverished with my upbringing as well again which is fucking bullshit pointing out the true fact that the upper middle class has been counterrevolutionary nearly of the time isnt antiintellectual sweetie you are literal fucking trash again a blatant falsity che was far more bourgeois than i could ever claim to be but he did more to improve the living standards of all cubans than you or i will likely do in our entire combined lifetimes but please keep on fetishizing back breaking manual labor and complaining about how becoming more educated would keep you down what a bunch of shit
socialism,removed,when i need left subs the most is why they are all going apeshit i was banned from rfeminism for thinking woman are capable of decided what type of relationship they want to be in and dont need the bed room police now woman are being told they cant draw anime because some of it is misogynist therefore it is inherently misogynist
socialism,removed,i dont think anyone is judged harshly i do think the narratives and conversations are dominated by african americans and its not like the black supremacy movement hasnt existed before so you can build that narrative if you please just doesnt seem grounded in reality mlk spoke to it but we seem to be less willing for whatever reason
socialism,removed,agreed obviously hate speech shouldnt be tolerated but you shouldnt have to be afraid of simply disagreeing about something
socialism,removed,shouldnt this be deleted he used the word crazy to describe capitalism
socialism,removed,i absolutely agree and i think majority of people want something different so let us hope we can make a change regarding this
socialism,removed,to attack an artists work as trash is cruel to do so in the name of combating misogyny is absurd especially when the artist is a woman this is irrational meanspirited behavior i do not believe the leaders of this sub accurately represent the interests of the majority of reddits socialists
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,where are all the cat women
socialism,removed,we must shatter the stereotype that leftists are humorless authoritarians it is essential to growing the movement
socialism,removed,this is a feminist sub mods stalk her offsite to her twitter the mods should pick one and stick with it
socialism,removed,how am i not banned yet you people are fucking idiots
socialism,removed,banning people who draw cat girls
socialism,removed,in this is removed
socialism,removed,you should never rule out violence or revolution what im saying is that maybe under the current circumstances we can better use the other avenues you mention if that is not the case we should form an underground movement plotting assasinations act
socialism,removed,banned because the mods have no sense of humour
socialism,removed,totally agree wouldnt want an alien and seditions type act to happen on reddit especially this sub of all subs to happen now would we
socialism,removed,ive spent an entire seconds in this sub and ive already found the best content it has to offer guess i never have to come back here thank you for that
socialism,removed,omg guys what if a girl drew this she is totally disrespecting her gender and other females if a girl draws porn then what do we do as a male neckbeard feminist i know whats best for women and i feel they need to stop oppressing themselves
socialism,removed,yes comrad it seems we must have a rogue mod removing all the catgirls its weird because this is a catgirl themed subreddit
socialism,removed,no dude cat ears are required to subvert bourgeois
socialism,removed,the mods are fascist as is socialist tradition comrad
socialism,removed,this subreddit and the mods are a disgrace to socialism and the working class this is why i moved to the center youre only reinforcing rightwing stereotypes about us about me i witnessed more tolerance and compassion in td than here
socialism,removed,yeah the mods are retarded
socialism,removed,i came here to learn about this and try and figure out if there was any difference between this subs banning policies and rthedonald
socialism,removed,huh thats funny abusive mods abusing their powers in rsocialism how ironic
socialism,removed,this is not a sub for sharing other users post histories fucking hypocrites
socialism,removed,this is not a sub for sharing other users post histories read your own damn sidebar maybe what the fuck are you playing at the art that she drew wasnt even for the subreddit why do you care about it
socialism,removed,i know right mods can silence people from contributing or interacting with thousands and thousands of people on a fairly popular subreddit of one of the largest websites in the world i hate when people say that
socialism,removed,as to the logic behind them getting banned its mindblowingly straightforward the medium is misogynist they produce artwork of women as domesticated animals what a complete load of horseshit if you guys are going to become so intolerant that something so completely innocuous can set you off then this sub is doomed to implode on itself
socialism,removed,your experiment in seeing if you could drag one sentence out into an essay has definitely succeeded though maybe not in the way you were expecting
socialism,removed,you could have spared us the wall of text and just said im a fucking prick
socialism,removed,you all need to you all need to you all need to
socialism,removed,ooph please be joking
socialism,removed,if we dont support racists we get racist presidents as if we had any other option l o fucking l
socialism,removed,you guys make me feel at home with the authoritarian regimeish feel of this sub its like im in my country mods crying about being brigaded harder than tds mods ever did while banning beloved contributors over cat ear drawings get your shit together rsocialism you should be the flagship of an ideology in this website not a burning canoe full of cunts
socialism,removed,yeah send them to the camps kill those who resist leaving only those too weak to oppose the authoritarian dictatorship you wish to impose then restrict freedom and hunt down all those who sympathise with democracy self expression and freedom of speech i mean im shocked socialism isnt the most popular policital ideology ever
socialism,removed,generally whats meant by idpol is not feminism antiracism or anything like that but rather those things being used to push other agendas and silence anyone who accuses them of this the ableism policy here for example allows the moderators to remove anyone promptly possibly for another unstated reason
socialism,removed,i have aspergers many good friends that ive met there do too aside from visitors from poi which are fairly frequent i think anonymity encourages trolling and the stating of things that you dont really believe to an extent there are so many good things about it too though
socialism,removed,true thats always a concern the other agenda varies on this subreddit i think a lot of it has to do with the mods promoting their specific strand of socialism using oppressive speech as a pretext for banning people with differering opinions in completely separate areas as well as just having a sense of power banning people can be thrilling its the closest thing you can do to violence over the internet its bashing the fash virtually maybe the mods are labelling so many people as reactionary because of that i dont know all i know is that when i talk about safe spaces getting out of hand im not lamenting how i cant be an asshole to transgendered people anymore — im lamenting how i cant say anything that goes against the party line on this subreddit anymore
socialism,removed,to an extent it does there are other advantages to it though when people arent trying to build a reputation for themselves they often act much less selfishly and more in the interest of the community trying to build a reputation for yourself is generally seen as a very bad thing on chans
socialism,removed,this post addresses that you can agree or disagree thats just their reasoning youre allowed to disagree youre allowed to go there and argue against it
socialism,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
socialism,removed,anarchism is garbage
socialism,removed,according to polls done both here and there the demographics are pretty much identical they have no fewer women or nonwhite people than we do
socialism,removed,christian socialist supporting rapey trots wew
socialism,removed,none of what she drew was porn having cat ears does not make a woman sexualised
socialism,removed,we are a true commune now fuck going back under the stalinist rule of these retards
socialism,removed,hello national socialist here d i too am glad that the mods are becoming more tolerant to different kinds of socialism dddddd
socialism,removed,replying to say this nigger thank you
socialism,removed,have you ever seen porn have you ever even seen anything remotely pornographic because that post is leading me to believe that you havent
socialism,removed,tankies anarchism and left communism are the main ideologies there mate lurk more

socialism,removed,sorry if left communism offends your authoritarian sensibilities
socialism,removed,it cant be worse than here
socialism,removed,why are you such a nazi have you ever tried not being a nazi would you like some resources to help you be less of a nazi in the future
socialism,removed,god damn you lot are a cunty bunch
socialism,removed,by not whining about his pissfetish like other idpol liberals
socialism,removed,reported for being devil worshipper also sony sucks those japs are silly af but anyway how was everyones thanksgiving
socialism,removed,id love to continue this discussion but in this moment my catgirl is in heat brb
socialism,removed,this is so stupid it feels like im having an outofbody experience
socialism,removed,again leftypol is not crusading against this sort of thing its not about asinine battles shit against sjws its about taking a break from yelling at each other about whats discriminatory to actually focus on the road ahead
socialism,removed,not to mention white knight is a right wing meme to shame men who take feminism seriously what in the actual fuck you sense motherfucker please dont breed and go move to the woods we dont need any more of you in society
socialism,removed,someone mailed chomsky about ableism bans on reddit he was bemused by the iy of it
socialism,removed,christian socialist wew
socialism,removed,they wouldnt theyd be busy working on a farm in siberia for a loaf of bread
socialism,removed,no fuck you
socialism,removed,yes over at leftypol
socialism,removed,although as someone who was read mein kampf i can assure you it is anything but ignorant
socialism,removed,theres already another one rautism
socialism,removed,mods on strike u tard
socialism,removed,nah bruh we are socialists of the cough national variety cough
socialism,removed,leftypol is a dead board you dont have the numbers to compete with the big dogs now fuck off
socialism,removed,no fuck you faggot
socialism,removed,ive posted twice and those were to things i saw when i woke up im not omnipresent asshole
socialism,removed,are you a transgender or a queer
socialism,removed,dont be salty leftypol theres commie cucks enough for everyone
socialism,removed,the term altright was coined by httpsenwikipediaorgwikirichardbspencer a known and vocal white supremacist who at a conference after the election openly performed the fascist salute and said hail trump while doing it if it talks like a nazi goosesteps like a nazi and hails like a nazi then its a youre a nazi you are a fascist if you want to stop being these things well talk but until then nope you have willingly and knowingly signed on with fascist
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,i think you must have linked that mistakenly i know youre a pedophile and all but i really dont need to see videos of the children that you fancy
socialism,removed,welcome to rsocialism where it is completely okay to associate and collaborate with an organization that knowingly covers up sexual assaults but drawings of women with cat ears is misogyny the irony is lost on no one but the mod team apparently
socialism,removed,hes one of the key figureheads of the altright movement as well as its founding members oh and since youre the one thats arguing about logic heres something for you when someone provides direct evidence in support of the fact that an entire political movement was built on fascist principles and the only counter argument is thats not what its about thats called moving the goalposts which is an actual logical fallacy so enjoy your delusions of legitimacy
socialism,removed,were overthrowing the mods
socialism,removed,jesus christ what liberal faggots mod purge when
socialism,removed,socialist mods being authoritarian fucking lol nobody saw that coming you people are fucking trash
socialism,removed,nationalism value the individual over the collective thats a contradiction in terms nationalism is by definition a prioritization of national over individual identity secondly pointing out that a movements genealogy and entire origins is from fascismnazism isnt an ad hominem because its a fact and no amount of handwaving can eliminate that lets do a run down of the alt right and fascist tendencies extreme nationalism checkity check check militarism and fetishization of the use of force in international matters ohh you better believe thats a check obsession over a group of easily idenitifiable others upon which all the problems of the polity is blamed oh check so so check rampant sexism and misogyny check belittlement and harassment of political opponents check youre a fascist the altright is fascism you are fooling yourself the people you support value your liberty about as much as they value a wet paper bag
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,removed
socialism,removed,this post is going to be removed
socialism,removed,youre essentially thanking the fire department for setting a fire in your house and the putting it out after half your shit is gone lmao cant make this stuff up
socialism,removed,this sub has gone to the birds maybe the mods shouldnt have been total parodies
socialism,removed,according to the mods yes the medium is sexist and depicting women with the traits of domesticated animals is misogynist so i can only assume that cat boys are misandrist
socialism,removed,this is the left
socialism,removed,even on reddit socialism turns authoritarian
socialism,removed,thanks to the rsocialism mods for introducing me to a great new webcomic i wouldnt have found out about it if not for your ridiculous authoritarianism
socialism,removed,well art isnt allowed here so why would books
socialism,removed,i think this sub is reading too much into the situation catgirls are a meme in japan cats are cute anime girls are cute combine the two and you see the appeal its literally no deeper than that
socialism,removed,u should be poisoned
socialism,removed,fuck you
socialism,removed,good its absolute insanity to block someone because they like to draw pictures of women with cat ears
socialism,removed,those books promote misogyny remove them
socialism,removed,i had to actually schedule an additional therapy session this week due to that image its unbelievable the mods would allow someone to come in here and attack us like that my ptsd treatment has probably been sent back months
socialism,removed,its almost like youre describing socialism or something
socialism,removed,socialism falling apart even when no production or resources are involved
socialism,removed,im not being facetious i literally think their actions mean theyre crazy
socialism,removed,you seriously dont get why someone who draws catgirls should be banned and hopefully hanged

socialism,removed,i dont care if i ever come down
socialism,removed,socialist mods being ultra authoritarian who would have thong
socialism,removed,how do you make a flair
socialism,removed,but spying on your own people to make sure they dont gasp have private property is perfectly fine amirite guess its off to the gulag with me the fact that you have stalin as one of your flairs says a lot about the moral fibre of this sub capitalism has led to the emancipation of literally billions of people from destitute poverty thats billions of mothers who dont die in childbirth and their baby with them thats billions of kids who can get an education and have a chance in life and you people want to tear it all down for the sake of ideological purity you want billions of people to never get a chance to experience the freedom opportunity an standard of living that everyone with the time to post on fucking reddit has thats privilege
socialism,removed,i doubt youd be killed or lol sent to a gulag but the means of production your family owns would be seized and youd be placed on gasp equal footing as the rest of us
socialism,removed,heres a sneak peek of rfullcommunism using the httpsnpredditcomrfullcommunismtopsorttoptall of the year httpimgurcommxrllqt im a bot beep boop httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
socialism,removed,until he graduated from reeducation camp of course
socialism,removed,looks like the bourgeois are keeping their hold onto rsocialism time for revolution
socialism,removed,the mods have really gone off the rails lately first with overdone ableism restrictions you cant even say dmb or stpid anymore which many people think is incredibly stpid after these ableism rules were instated there was a lot of backlash from the sub users but mods brushed it off by orwellianly painting it as outside brigadingdrama instead of actual genuine concern and criticism any users questioning it were given the same treatment as every other user trying to appeal a ban in leftist subs nowadays the mods mocked them and made fun of them silenced them and banned them without any kind of mature discussion or explanation lately this shit really got insne cant say that either lol when a mod banned a rsocialism user because she draws a webcomic called httpwwwpoliticalideologycatgirlscom or something that features cute catgirls representing different leftist ideologies the rsocialism mod banned her because she argued that drawing women as catspets is inherently sexist and patriarchal well all the users of this sub immediately flipped out were calling for the mods heads on sticks other rival boards like leftypol listeners of the chapo trap house podcast and other brocialists as the mods here like to deride them as showed up for the show being the mentally unstable weak little babies they are a few mods couldnt handle the pressure and went on strike aka took their toys and went home which lasted all of minutes when they realized that they wouldve actually been doing the sub a huge favor now people are calling for a redo of the entire mod team mods are stating that the mods in question have already left although that is unverified and remains to be seen basically the moderation of this sub have been revealed to be a bunch of total psychs who are completely off the rails obsessed with identity politics to the point where theyre turned the sub into an authorian ideological purity crucible where nobody even feels safe to speak their mind anymore and people want a socialist revolution to oust the current authoritarian mod team and replace them with one that is democratically elected
socialism,removed,no need to patronize me its an honest question
socialism,removed,yeah but its still apt usage
socialism,removed,people who are angry that they arent being allowed to do whatever the hell they want as long as whatever the hell they want is democratically decided then i have no problem with it if youre in favor of democracy you have to take whatever it is the people vote for thats the whole idea i disagree with for example the heavy handiness of the ableist policy i think calling people ableist terms is wrong but calling a situation ine isnt i disagree with the banning of the catgirl artist same sexismracism are genuine problems that need to be addressed but going about it this way only repels and alienates potential converts but the difference between me and you is i want rsocialism to continue on as a strong community and you are a brigader from leftypol that is just here to rile people up and cause problems i want it to be a strong community too which is why the current mod team which is ultimately harmful to the sub and therefore the entire image of the left on reddit needs to go
socialism,removed,catgirls might not be allowed here but what about batgirls
socialism,removed,wow dude dont ever go on xbox live if you want your mom to stay unfucked
socialism,removed,worry about your own states assholes if you dont like our laws you can fucking leave already
socialism,removed,get off the fucking road then duh
socialism,removed,hey look its the mod of both rlatestagecapitalism and rfullcommunism die in a fire you fucking tankie
socialism,removed,so you think its alright to call for death threats against others fascists in this case but when someone makes a death threat against you its suddenly not okay the mod of rlatestagecapitalism and rfullcommunism everybody
socialism,removed,lol socialists are fucking idiots
socialism,removed,do we just stop enforcing the rules causewhat i hope not i love seeing the leftwing movement on reddit implode
socialism,removed,whats the dial with btw im not socialist at all im from venezuela so i live this problem everyday im not pro with ur ideals but wanna stay to discuss some stufs later or im gonna be banner
socialism,removed,i thought police enforced the law
socialism,removed,eh dis white boi tryna say dat i ain no socialist but i tol him dat im a proud black man fo rea he dun got me fuckin heated boii its suh bullshit wat it is fo rea wat do i ain neva been so mad befo
socialism,removed,im a woman and this march makes me cringe its not a march for proles its a march so a bunch of liberal elites can play identity politics and make poor white women feel guilty about being white guess what there is nothing great about being poor im so tired of idpol
socialism,removed,its funny how my interpretation of it is totally different to me it seems like a bunch of liberals sitting around playing oppression olympics the article talking about the dissent references one of the members saying white women need to talk less i mean what the fuck seriously its college all over again i have a story for you i was in a womens studies class once in college and we had two particular people in the class one was a young french woman who was an exchange student the other was an african american woman who was a mother now keep in mind i live in new orleans so race relations here like in all of the south can be tense at times despite nola being pretty easy going well one day the french woman was talking about some point and instead of saying people of color she said colored people this was a totally innocuous mistake on her part one she did not understand culturally how the latter was offensive to americans and two her point was actually defending people of color not demeaning them you would think this context would be enough to sort of i dont know diffuse the bomb she was about to set off but no the black woman tore into her until the french woman was literally crying literally fucking crying apologizing and crying and she left the class she was like im sorry sob leaves i remember this vividly because i sat next to the french woman i was fucking shocked when i talked to my girlfriend about it now ex gf she was totally on the side of the african american woman she was honduran and was pretty much just like you white people have to learn it didnt matter what her intentions were or that it was a cultural faux pas all that mattered was that she slipped up and in doing so in the eyes of these liberals exposed her latent racism and white privilege so they felt entitled to totally rip her apart wow muh oppression olympics so productive the entire week was scandalized by this bullshit and we learned nothing all it did was drive a wedge between the class and made people afraid to speak
socialism,removed,its just an interesting thought that occured to me you have a point about cooperatives the key difference there though is that worker coops are voluntary and socialism as a form of government is forced on you much like school group projects
socialism,removed,round up and kill those at the top of the patriarchy or those who wanted to be independent thats what they did to the ukrainians mobocracyegalitarianismgenocidefaminetotalitarianism
socialism,removed,can you rebuke or find a fallacy in my statement
socialism,removed,how many countries would have tried to take the usa if it werent for its military and its allies plenty they keep is free by their mere presence extremely short sighted op wouldnt expect anything less though from a year old who was just taught socialism in a public school
socialism,removed,dont turn this into a strawman arguement im purely talking about defence this arguement has nothing to do with the usas occupations of other countries
socialism,removed,trust me in terms of the usas military aggression i am with you i agree that iraq and the rest of the middle east is disgusting including the toppling of libya covertly as a nation the usa is shady as fuck but to sit here and say that the current military dont protect the country is ludicrous every nation worldwide has a defence force for that reason its just that the usa goes past defence and peacekeeping
socialism,removed,fortunately
socialism,removed,lol no they are not
socialism,removed,sex sells comrades not that i am complaining its a nice drawing not so sure about the texts kick their axis is pretty fucking clumsy pun
socialism,removed,soviets werent exactly on a humanitarian cause in that war either as a finn i can guarantee you that you shouldnt make too broad generalizations about the motivations and moral principles of different players in that war
socialism,removed,ok im ready for the downvotes but here goes i think what people really mean when they say that is that our armed forces exist to protect us from invasion from foreign countries the country believed in the domino theory for much of the later half of the century and believed that if we didnt defeat the communists in se asia we would be fighting them on the shores of california we have been attacked by the japanese in and by the british in and by muslim extremists many times we are currently using our armed forces to prevent further attacks by muslim extremists at least thats the theory i would also add that because of muslim extremists you have already lost some of those freedoms you say havent been threatened the government snoops on everyone there are cameras in most big cities watching your every move some rentacop has the right to stop you and search you at airport security small town cops now look like delta force and can confiscate your private property without a trial etc ive kind of gotten off track a little bit but yeah veterans keep us free because they prevent our enemies from attacking us maybe if you dont see it its because theyre doing a pretty good job of it
socialism,removed,just look at the nice and welldefined ass on her kicking the nazi with apparently very minimal physical or psychological effort judging by her calm face can you argue that she wouldnt be qualified as a prime individual in evolutionary sense now if you are one of those people who get agitated by sex even as a basic concept or you consider it to cheapen art try to consider that as long as you are depicting healthy human individuals performing dynamic physical activities you are gonna include some amount of sexuality innit voluntarily or not
socialism,removed,facism was a leftist movement so why are nazis who are leftists being compared to the altright
socialism,removed,spotted the ad hominem attack
socialism,removed,its a dumb joke
socialism,removed,this is a whole new level of delusional
socialism,removed,an did not keep anyone free im kurdish and i disagree more than million kurds were rfreed from saddam
socialism,removed,we are trying to win people to the ideas of marxism and socialism marxism maybe a shallow form of socialdemocracy it would be a stretch to say that you stand for marxism when your party denounces the theory of the rate of profit to fall one of the core marxist principles forming a united front with to peel workers towards our ideas idealism why not just go all the way and start advocating propaganda of the deed was a huge success success in what way you have one person elected to a council seat or do you mean your tactics of telling people to vote bernie then stein lead to the successful failure of those two left can learn from this yeah that your successes only exist within narrow confines of propaganda and self delusion
socialism,removed,the center and the right have nothing to do with communism theyre part of the spectrum of bourgeois politics if you place yourself on the left of that then youre still on the same spectrum
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,peter taafe runs the organization he is on the iec which dictates the policy of all of the associated parties hes also the one who is protecting an alleged rapist
socialism,removed,the left of capital has nothing to do with communism they are our enemies just as much as any other party of capital
socialism,removed,why would anyone stand with a party that protects a rapist has a history of sexual assaults has a policy of jumping on what ever is trending on twitter and abandons marxist criticism because it doesnt suit their ideological perspective
socialism,removed,bigoted attacks what about the real problems with the party why should i stand with a leftist who places themselves on the left of capital is in a party that supporters antimarxist and antirevolutionary positions protects an alleged rapist and whose members all have the theoretical level of the average larper
socialism,removed,lol the left is dead
socialism,removed,the main point was that salt is against capitalism too no they are not theyre against a certain type of capitalism in favor of their own type do you think that im just bringing up their rejection of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall for no reason and theres no point fighting each other about the exact way to to over throw capitalism and we need to remember were on the same side ok but these people are not interested in over throwing capitalism they dont promote that idea at all in any of their publications were weak when we fight amongst ourselves and thats why the right and the far right and the centrist are kicking our ass out i n the real world does the real world mean parliamentary politics because that is all i can get out of every single cwi publication
socialism,removed,i dont know about the rape allegations what a huge surprise the working class right now is pretty reactionary no shit and calling them fascists and racists isnt going to help should we not defend them as well since we disagree even more with the average worker than the average salt member why salt arent relevant they never will be those reactionary members of the working class who make obummer posts on facebook are going to do more for the communist revolution than a group of elitist academics who have no connection to the working class
socialism,removed,your identity politics is whats killing the left
socialism,removed,just some sour sectarians nothing more just like that woman who said was raped by a member and called a sectarian for it i remember attending one of the many debates where they were allowed to put forward their points of view and if the debate i went to was anything like the others they were pretty decisively beaten lol the trpf has been beaten as a concept
socialism,removed,thats got absolutely nothing to do with this discussion it has everything to do with the discussion when people challenge the cwi on any subject they get accused of being a sectarian no the point is it wasnt the party bureaucracy that prevented them from putting their view across it was the rank and file membership that rejected them whether we were wrong or right is another matter but it doesnt change the fact that these people have concocted a non existent conspiracy why do you think its better that the rank and file rejected them you saying this says a lot more about the complete lack of care that the elitists in the cwi bureaucracy have in maintaining any sort of revolutionary principles in the party its just all numbers and control all towards directing members to vote democrats when the time calls for it
socialism,removed,they fought for the freedom of the kurds in america
socialism,removed,why are you complaining is it bad to point out that complete failures of a party or does their activism out weight that
socialism,removed,thats an awfully narrow group of people though shouldnt american soldiers fight for the freedoms of all americans not necessarily
socialism,removed,gay
socialism,removed,im super concerned about lies the right likes to tell about communists super concerned
socialism,removed,well the endless asiatic horde is kind of true
socialism,removed,its a big problem with politics no matter which side youre on i am generally very leftleaning and pro socialism but i got banned from rlatestagecapitalism for setting the record straight i wouldnt read to much into it the moderation team on that sub has become complete cancer i got banned for simply discussing some of their policies on another sub
socialism,removed,oh but i thought stalin the genocidal dictator wasnt true communism and thanks im excited to use them to defend freedom
socialism,removed,wat im not a rdonald lover how the hell did you make the jump the russians the mongols the goths the huns they all had number advantages i never said they were cowards how is that nazi propoganda are you insinuating that im a nazi i also like how youre calling for my ban after just saying that the russians had a number advantage what a great way to deal with people with differing opinions youve pushed me further from socialism with this interaction
socialism,removed,i wouldnt call the film politically barren it seemed pretty clear to me that the jheda rebels were the taliban the empire were nazis the rebel alliance were us gis
socialism,removed,the state itself is essentially fascist and has been for some time trump himself cannot be said to be anymore fascist than clinton or obama especially when unlike the other two he literally has not done anything yet hell obama recently signed into law a bill that essentially creates a de facto ministry of truth trump didnt have anything to do with that and the fact that obama and the members of congress have no problem handing over these powers to a supposed fascist shows that they in fact dont actually consider trump anywhere near a threat as they are claiming he is literally the only thing people are calling him fascist on is his language which although grotesque is frankly not enough if we tear down the meaning of fascism to the point where it essentially means someone saying things in a way that we dont likewell thats just a huge slap to the fact to the victims of actual very real fascism in the century he does not advocate for corporatization but hes an outsider just like hitler or mussolini were well he essentially does advocate for corporatization but just being an outsider does not a fascist make this is hillary clinton levels of smearing now anyone outside of the current power structure is a fascist lol
socialism,removed,the only people that can be actually compared to nazis today are the muslims but for some reason the liberals never make that comparison
socialism,removed,i dont think all people who dislike identity politics dislike women people of color or the lgbtq community hell bernie sanders has said he doesnt like identity politics it can be meant towards those who cannot see beyond their own group identity politics has traditionally kept out non racial based classism little has been done to correct this on the other hand internally the brocialists are pretty well hated and are typically dealt with while brocialists do hate identity politics i dont think it should make the subject immune from criticism i personally do stand in solidarity with everyone who is oppressed though i feel like there are those within the left who are classist people who are part of identity politics who try to wedge out poor whites from every discussion i also think theres also racists who do the same to black issues i dont think the one makes the other less true
socialism,removed,people of color are more likely to be proletarians in the west but most proletarians in the west are still not people of color divisive identity politics such as for instance blm activists getting on stage at a bernie rally and screaming at the audience that theyre racists splits white proletarians from nonwhite proletarians and undermines class solidarity demanding that we talk about the economic issues that unite all working people isnt focusing on the issues of ablebodied cishet white men nor is it throwing anyone under the bus stop buying into the neoliberal identitarian frame
socialism,removed,militarism he said he wants to pull our boys out of middle east ethnocentrism falls flat again because muslims actually are shite cool word tho
socialism,removed,and you believe full socialism is the answer to that problem that the spots in schools wouldnt continue to be filled by the relatives and friends of people in influential positions
socialism,removed,if only socialist countries didnt have the exact same factories with the exact same working conditions
socialism,removed,or on collective farms
socialism,removed,i wont be baited into saying something that will get me banned if you believe that is the point i am making you are viewing everything from a very whatever socialist color you guys like red lens i am not arguing that socialism isnt perfect im arguing that it wouldnt serve the purpose of this post at all there is no evidence in my opinion that this problem would be improved while many other things would get much worse you also cannot establish that a constitutional republic is a worse system without evidence frankly the historic evidence is on my side period i can assert that its better with examples and the present standing of the world while you have philosophical ideals that would likely make karl marx refute his entire claim see how i just asserted an unprovable statement its frustrating isnt it i respect your right to have a different opinion but good lord get off your high horse if you would like to call my opinions terrible go ahead we are in your digital home
socialism,removed,live under socialism rejected from society because reject socialism have free time and internet access crush socialism on a global scale lol
socialism,removed,wait so people wont do labour under socialism or what lol
socialism,removed,no need to speculate on the people who lived and died enslaved marxists regimes did actually make sure their brains spent their time in goulags no inequality allowed intelligence is dissidence
socialism,removed,if you gave a tablet to most kids in africa theyd probably try to rape it
socialism,removed,under socialism no one farms or makes clothes and everyones einstein we already know exactly what happens to people like einstein under socialismto the gulags
socialism,removed,so the solution to fix this issue is to take that wealthy advantage from those who have it and just give it to the poor never going to happen welcome to how the real world works inequality at birth will always be a thing always its the very nature of human beings and no law government ideal or religionwill ever change that what we can prove is that capitalism can benefit everyone more than socialism ever will how dare i disagree with this sub ban incoming
socialism,removed,because the american middle class year olds in this subreddit are eloquently versed in socialist theory dont talk as if this is an intellectual platform its disenfranchised kids sharing memes want people to actually take you seriously study economics disprove the mathematically rigorous theories evolved over years by some of the smartest people in history or keep on your current track cant we just kill the rich and take money from banks thatll work
socialism,removed,okay what if nobody wants to do labour because labour sucks
socialism,removed,you find a better system to replace capitalism than socialism and youd be right
socialism,removed,do i think the children of affluent parents are smarter no this is actually unclear a large component of intelligence is hereditary so if traditional measures of success in our modern culture income power etc are correlated with intelligence then it is possible that those kids on average are smarter not saying i think this is case but i dont agree with your statement out of hand either
socialism,removed,one thing doesnt always have to have anything to do with the other this is quite a stretch
socialism,removed,youre missing my point labour is the worst type of work in socialism why would anyone do it
socialism,removed,i bet its not true just look at the mean iq in african nations
socialism,removed,that is what you tell yourself so you can think there will still be people labouring for you in bullshit jobs let me guess you wont be digging ditches for drainage lines or roofing houses in the summer that will be people who enjoy doing those things hahahahahaha
socialism,removed,hahaha this subreddit exists give me free shit because im a lame ass oh never change reddit never change
socialism,removed,that is my point who will do the hard labour
socialism,removed,ya lets stop smothering the poor and start smothering everyone
socialism,removed,people with real talent will overcome any adverse situation talentless people will blame someone else for their own failures
socialism,removed,which is why we should make their intelligence meritless and consider them equal to everyone else
socialism,removed,ya good luck automating putting down residential flooring installing boilers and running pipes through buildings tiling roofs or all that other bullshit youre living in a fantasy
socialism,removed,socialists complaining about talented people being to work in hard labour earning little pay omfg the irony is amazing
socialism,removed,marxs labour value theory lvt and tendency of the rate of profit to fall trpf now have zero respect in academic economics they are flawed at a fundamental level profit is reinvested in rd and people do indeed choose how they split their time between work and leisure why are you suggesting i read empirically disproved work especially when you clearly know nothing about it serious advocates those who actually realise that original marxism is theoretically flawed have had to do some serious back tracking these neomarxists still have no foothold in any respectable academic circles youre not even at that stage youre clinging to disproved work very few people understand to try and come across as unique and special pathetic
socialism,removed,the billboard is real the people on the street arent noce propaganda
socialism,removed,seems like its working well in venezuela
socialism,removed,racist
socialism,removed,tacos
socialism,removed,how many people of similar talent to do you think died in gulags
socialism,removed,so that is your socialist answer people should stop having their toilets clog up
socialism,removed,i did not know this sub existed gave me a good giggle to start my day
socialism,removed,does this not make a great argument for capitalism if youre really talented you can actually go out and be whatever you want to be with hard work someone explain how this makes socialism look good i would also think that with socialism people with the talent of einstein would have little incentive to leave the sweatshops or their fields to take any kind of risk since theres little reward and socialism runs a lot off of the spoils system
socialism,removed,then how come adopted children test at the same iq as their biological parents even when raised in a wealthy environment
socialism,removed,why are you so scared to debate me why do you keep down voting me so your argument for socialism to work is have have nobody ever do hard work and just hope people keep their shit in order because in socialism everyone will suddenly change and roofs will never need to be replaced what a lovely idea and robots will do all the tough work hahahahahah ya robot cop will come over and lay all the flooring in your house hahahaha so lets see nobody takes initiative today but when socialism comes everyone will suddenly sing coombayah and have space robots doing all our work for us buddy youre living a fantasy
socialism,removed,this shows another layer or ignorance modern economic theory is rigorous from hypothesis to model creation to testing mathematical economics and statistics use real world data forming natural experiments experiments in the classical sense are also used in microeconomics and behavioural economics the divides you cite relate to specific disagreements austrian vs chicago school revolves around things like the role of monetary policy the nature of property rights the efficiency or markets none are particularly quantifiable disagreements like these exist even in the most objective subjects mathematicians argue about if numbers are real or not im not saying economics is as rigorous as physics but its a lot closer that youre making it out to be austrian vs chicago is like mathematicians arguing if numbers are naturally occurring or a human invention whilst the marxist is arguing about how the earth is flat tldr economics is indeed more subjective than the hard sciences but you can definitely be proven objectively wrong which marx has been
socialism,removed,yeah my point is very simple who will do the shitty work the back breaking labour tell me how you will automate roofing a house or building a scaffolding you cant answer this question
socialism,removed,we know that environment and education dont raise iq for adopted children and that it is strongly heritable
socialism,removed,no its not its httpsenwikipediaorgwikiminnesotatransracialadoptionstudy
socialism,removed,how does socialism fix the problem of bad parenting andor parents who put their kids in more or less advantageous positions for success
socialism,removed,one of the studies findings was the iqs of adopted black children reared by white families did not differ significantly from that of black children raised by their biological parents httpsenwikipediaorgwikiminnesotatransracialadoptionstudy
socialism,removed,honestly we work harder and are more stressed under capitalism than any generation before how do you come to that conclusion we are the most productive read least labor generation ever
socialism,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiminnesotatransracialadoptionstudy
socialism,removed,dont agree on this
socialism,removed,there are people who were probably as smart as einstein who died due to socialism there were million slaves brought during americas history of slavery there were million people killed under socialist regimes in the century
socialism,removed,i appreciate that he was banging his doubly related cousin
socialism,removed,look theres broad consensus that iq is highly heritable youre not posting shit a recent study of for instance suggests that iq heritability either remains constant through adolescence and adulthood or continues to increase with age
socialism,removed,because if we dont focus percent on the mistakes of the past we run the risk of actually moving forward and finding a solution cant have that better to race bait right
socialism,removed,no it doesnt
socialism,removed,considering that of students to stanford get to go for free and the fact that that number isnt extreme in academia yes
socialism,removed,develop that point and write an essay hand it to an economic journal for review they publish you receive the novel prize for economics enjoy your riches youll go down in history or are you just some guy on reddit talking about something they know nothing about econ knowledge whilst arguing with the most well respected academics in the world hilarious
socialism,removed,he literally addressed that fuckhead ya the robots lol
socialism,removed,the bar is lower for the kids in detroit to get good grades and the bar is also lower for them to get into college additionally if youre poor its ironically much easier to afford college than if youre middle class because theres substantial funding for people who are poor the true advantage for being wealthier is that you dont need to take out student loans or compete for grant money and therefore can major in underwater basket weaving instead of pursuing a career that actually pays
socialism,removed,the beauty of this quote is that all aspects of it are supported by empirical facts
socialism,removed,alternative interprations ok the findings add to growing evidence that school performance has a large heritable component with around of the differences in pupils gcse results being explained by genetic factors
socialism,removed,i thought this was an riamverysmart post
socialism,removed,theres a flaw in your thought process you seem to think that the alternative would be everyone gets the good education no the reality is everyone gets the poor education
socialism,removed,are you really going to try that
socialism,removed,the only thing i see is someone saying that the adopted environment doesnt matter because pre adoption environment caused them to have the iq of their biological parents as opposed to their life and education later not very convincing
socialism,removed,im not really sure how socialism offers a solution to this
socialism,removed,this is scary that this has so many up votes
socialism,removed,so smart they couldnt improve their station capitalism decides who is smart and who is poor
socialism,removed,he also slept with his cousin between cheating on his wife and sleeping with his niece other aunt
socialism,removed,people who die from capitalism die trying to defend it people who die from socialism starve to death
socialism,removed,httpsgfycatcomzigzagdamagedbarracuda
socialism,removed,every ounce of labor value a worker produces should be returned to them in equal value of goods or currency which is not what happens in capitalism this is a very naive approach if your workers were paid the exact same amount that they brought into the company then the company is merely breaking even so no profit so no reason to exist as a company and do you really think the person stocks shelves deserves more money than the ceo or the president of the company simply because his brow is sweatier people are paid relative to the amount of value they produce simple as that to quote the great battling ben shapiro socialism is the most selfish system on the planet because it says i am breathing therefore you owe me capitalism on the other hand is the most altruistic system on the planet because it says if i dont give something of value then i will not get something of value in return in order to get you have to give in capitalism this is the reason capitalism has created the greatest societies the world has ever seen and socialism always fails
socialism,removed,dont kids in america all sit similar exams nope exams at prestigious private schools are much harder than public schools and exams like the ones you linked to are not used to determine college entrance college entrance is determined by high school grades high school activities and another test called the sat or act if youre in some areas of the country which is not administered or controlled by the government performance expectations are different depending on your race and class because admissions officers take that into account
socialism,removed,how about the millions who died under stalin pol pot and kim jong ill
socialism,removed,the idea behind that saying is that capitalism made it possible for people at apple to invent the iphone not that without capitalism nothing ever gets made
socialism,removed,so if its not the parents putting them in that situation what is putting them in that situation socialism your saying that the answer is to become more like these countries that are forcing parents to put their kids in sweatshops im confused why should i be responsible for your kid capitalism requires consent from both parties consent is a form of freedom you want to force people to do things you think is best
socialism,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiheritabilityofiq hundreds of empirical rigorous scientific studies have been done on this pull your head out of the sand and stop posting bullshit opinions when there is actual hard evidence at your fingertips
socialism,removed,totally fair nazis died trying to defend socialism
socialism,removed,jesus christ dude the wikipedia article links to dozens of sources if youre actually too lazy to fucking google it or read a single goddamned study heres one for you maybe you should try actually reading information that conflicts with your worldview instead of just stubbornly saying nope prove it to anyone who dumps a page with dozen sources in your lap
socialism,removed,well
socialism,removed,many people break the cycle so that is just false most recently immigrating minority groups who grew up impoverished have broken that cycle their parents came over here to give them opportunity because thats what there is here compared to the socialist places that they came from i didnt say bad parenting as much as putting your kids in the best position for success there is a big difference if everyone could have the same education but it was bad would you be happy because everyone was equal if everyone was equally wealthy but we were all poor would you see that as a success would that be fair to everyone the person who works hard and the person who doesnt want to work hard and have a life of leisure
socialism,removed,i wonder how much the combined body weight of the hundred million marxists killed by their comrades weighed
socialism,removed,but the market forces us to work longer and longer what why can you define forces in this context undoing progress that was already made by the labour struggle in the past not in my experience
socialism,removed,because socialism doesnt have these things
socialism,removed,wow just wow first i never said anything about strongly genetic at all you jackass i said moderately heritable even the dude you were railroading said strongly heritable which isnt the same thing as strongly genetic you should probably learn how to interpret heritability coefficients do i need to also spoon feed you papers on how to do that or can you handle this one on your own second seriously just stop youre wrong there is strong consensus on these findings which you claimed doesnt exist first of all there isnt consensus i could literally just do a lit review finding large swaths of alternative interpretations third please no really just stop youre making me worried about the future of the medical profession if you rely on your opinions instead of the science have a lovely day
socialism,removed,lol yeah we got so many black einsteins these days
socialism,removed,and thats why admissions officers take your background into consideration when deciding whether or not to admit you
socialism,removed,i dont
socialism,removed,not that many probably
socialism,removed,public schools in the us are run and regulated individually by the state not the federal government there is no nationwide consistency but there may be consistency within a school district but even then private school and parochial schools fall outside of the public school system and their exams do not apply exams at private schools are much much harder than exams at public schools there are some nation wide efforts to ensure that all students receive similar educations but those scores are for the school not for the student so who sets this is it a standard that every kid takes no matter what school they went to its an independent company that created a test because our schools lack any other form of performance evaluation against a standard it has since become a popular tool for colleges for obvious reasons you only take this test if youre planning to go to college you must pay for it and it has absolutely no bearing on your high school grades or evaluation
socialism,removed,ergo i am literally retarded you said it not me what it shows is that youre spewing stronglyworded opinions on something that you likely dont understand as well as you think you do its not a crime but i urge you to allow yourself to admit that others especially those who actually do research in this field might know a whole lot more than you do theres a difference between skepticism and cynicism
socialism,removed,you clearly went to school in detroit and therefore have the same likelihood of getting the grades they need to get into college
socialism,removed,sweat shops raise the living standard they provide an income and service
socialism,removed,who
socialism,removed,venezuela ok bud
socialism,removed,capitalism has reduced the barrier to entry becoming a capitalist now a days capital is so cheap anyone with a good credit can get a loan and become a business owner also labour theory of value fails to explain things like brand name clothing
socialism,removed,dae muh daawkins strawman is raysis xdddd
socialism,removed,yes another white apologist such reverence
socialism,removed,and abortion clinics
socialism,removed,this just seems like the anti experts thinking that lead to brexit rather than attacking the academics for being bias why not develop alternative arguments
socialism,removed,is he chosen
socialism,removed,doesnt this quote go against socialism everyone gets paid the same so then you will have great minds that will do easier menial labor compared to difficult research
socialism,removed,im agnostic about that but there is at least some evidence mixed overall that they are for example my real opinion is that intelligence is such a mushy term and probably incredibly difficult to nail down but you made the incredible strong confident statement that they are not i would love to see the evidence you have demonstrating a conclusive lack of correlation between the two
socialism,removed,im agnostic about that but there is at least some evidence mixed overall that they are for example my real opinion is that intelligence is such a mushy term and probably incredibly difficult to nail down but you made the incredible strong confident statement that they are not i would love to see the evidence you have demonstrating a conclusive lack of correlation between the two
socialism,removed,work on your reading comprehension in my city not a single school had any method of standardizing high school performance that was conveyed to colleges our schools dont even use the same scale when giving grades sats do not measure learning past geometry and vocabulary they are primarily a reflection on intelligence recently the satii has gained popularity which does test people on subjects but that is only a requirement for the most selective colleges and most people do not take them
socialism,removed,please explain how socialism changes this or improves it more than capitalism
socialism,removed,til steven jay gould didnt know his ass from a hole in the wall this is like saying im not interested in this apple because those apple seeds didnt get planted eat the fucking apple and go shit some seeds in the woods and see what happens if everyone in society worked for notforprofit charity organizations well we wouldnt have much of a society would we
socialism,removed,and some iq tests were designed to disprove racism was genetically based the results were the same irregardless of which test is administered
socialism,removed,im sorry a sub deidicated to fucking socialism is complaining about human lives being wasted how delusional are people on this sub
socialism,removed,still struggling with that reading comprehension no worries ill spell it out for you nobody mentioned equality outside of the equal ability to get into college
socialism,removed,so instead we can all work in sweatshops and nobody can rise to greatness unless we tell them they can
socialism,removed,tell that to venezuela whos richest citizen is comrade hugo chavez eldest daughter whos worth over billion dollars while the people starve to death and are forced into the black market
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,glad socialist countries have a great education track record
socialism,removed,its also responsible for giving rights to under privileged minorities for the first time in history and creating the most prosperous nation in the world socalism works as a theory but in practice it has lead to catastrophe over and over socialism cant be enforced without an authoritarian government
socialism,removed,also see the millions of dead bodies marx left in his wake his ideology is a human cancer that some countries have still not cured
socialism,removed,how do you feel worshiping someone who fucked his maid and left her and his child out on the streets
socialism,removed,yeah imagine the advances if all human potential is stolen and given out by a centralised power thats socialism
socialism,removed,if you really must categorize people according to biological features at least include classconsciousness in the identitylabel so legitimate struggles dont get coopted to serve capitalist interests
socialism,removed,no people just agree with the picture not your toxic cancerous ideologies
socialism,removed,socialism is a fad
socialism,removed,in my city not a single school had any method of standardizing high school performance that was conveyed to colleges except the sat which you said is standardised high school performance refers to your performance in high school classes in our high schools your teachers give you a grade based on test they administer the grades you receive are averaged and weighted by the school to generate your overall grade gpa not all courses are equally weighted because some are less work which is used by colleges to understand how well an applicant did during high school the sat does not impact your high school gpa the sat reflects intelligence not high school performance or learning it does not test anything that was taught in high school unless you have special needs a disability and were advanced to high school prior to learning geometry in conclusion there is no standardization of high school performance the only standardization for students is their sat scores which are submitted in conjunction with but have no relation to your high school transcript so somewhere i can find schools taking the same tests presumably i can find several in fact even if i can also find schools that arent taking the same tests you might find some schools taking the same test in one or more subjects but the colleges to which they are applying have no insight into that the us is a large country with many different local laws and regulations i dont know them all there are high schools in the us the fact that maybe a few of them share tests is meaningless especially considering that a colleges have no insight into what tests are shared and b the maximum theoretical percentage of schools administering the same test is in practice it is likely the similarities that may or may not exist are insignificant so unless my reading comprehension is indeed as bad as you seem to think it is this looks like a statewide standardised test for public education regarding science with the exception being for students with disabilities who can take other standardised tests that test doesnt impact your gpa and is not revealed to colleges when you apply it has no bearing on your college application or high school evaluation this test can be used to allow you to take college courses in high school but it is not used in the college admissions process
socialism,removed,cant wait to see all of their opinions deleted
socialism,removed,free online college for all and internet access wait were mostly there now edxorg and other mmocs also a einstin today could spin up a super computer on amazon for almost nothing thats where the first ai will come from i think a old coder in africa running vms funded by kickstarter
socialism,removed,oh shut the fuck up
socialism,removed,to be fair would it not be their perogative to get their sorry arses out of that situation then
socialism,removed,despite whether or not people agreed with my comment everyone understood it except for you
socialism,removed,or in gulags
socialism,removed,i am somehow less interested in the weight and convolutions of einsteins brain than in the near certainty the people of equal talent have been killed by socialist regimes
socialism,removed,yeah bruh socialism is the best
socialism,removed,are you forgetting the capital risked in hiring the labor buying the raw materials determining the market demand transportation logistics marketing legal overhead etc
socialism,removed,he wrote the mismeasure of man the fundamental assumptions of this work have been shown to be completely baseless evolution continued to act upon humans after we left africa and the resulting changes are not even close to being limited to superficial physical characteristics as gould contended the book is a work of political propaganda not science it useful only to show how important it is to limit the influence of marxism and keep it the hell away from science at all costs
socialism,removed,no financial incentive no pioneering inventions
socialism,removed,you have done that not me i only answered your many questions after my first comment you had complete control over the direction of the conversation i did tell you that courses are much harder at private schools than public schools but you never cared to ask why or mention it until it became convenient to change the subject
socialism,removed,everyone stole from everyone most still do the real question is why some were better than others at doing it
socialism,removed,maybe you should read some literature on the theories of free market capitalism instead of indulging in biased anticapitalistic nonsense heres a hint marx never understood that the worker is the consumer
socialism,removed,wouldnt natural selection make higher intelligence a favorable trait in early civilizations as opposed to strength china was civilized first so it makes sense they have a marginally superior average iq
socialism,removed,national socialism is anticapitalistic by definition you socialists will never succeed with your lies even though sorel said it was ok to to do so
socialism,removed,i completely agree with you thank goodness the free market capitalist system gives people the opportunity to pursue their own self interests as opposed to a socialist system where one has to pursue the needs of the group which is inevitably the state
socialism,removed,they would have more free time if people like you went out there and helped them instead of pretending like your some white knight on the internet lazy people like you who would prefer to hide behind their computer screens instead of actually lifting a finger to help anyone are the reason these people are in difficult financial situation if you really wanted to practice what you preach mobilize the people on this subreddit to go out to soup kitchens and homeless shelters once a week
socialism,removed,goulds a bit of social justice warrior though just in case someone scrolls this far down he took the equality argument from marxism and very deliberately conflated ought with is to fit his agenda very dishonest t best and einstein wrote his best work while working as a clerk in a patent office for crying out loud and im a leftist who loves biology just not a big lover of science driven by agenda i prefer the other way around
socialism,removed,dude you really need to focus more on receiving what people are trying to say and less time getting triggered by figments of your imagination
socialism,removed,yes also enjoy it when scientists start from a political agenda and use it to inform their writings biased science is best science
socialism,removed,i wonder how many have lived and died in the gulags and bread lines
socialism,removed,people who are disadvantaged still enjoy far cheaper capital than before take blacks in america for example as a group they have enjoyed a tremendous amount of economic progress since the abolition of slavery guess which system they progressed under capitalism also credit score isnt biased against people of color its statistical fact that a black person has a higher default rate than a white person these things arent biases they are just facts whatever the cause of these things is another story saying credit score is biased against people of color is like saying math hates black people loans also exist with the primary motivation of extracting profit from the consumer and the only thing fighting against the potential predation and exploitation of average citizens by the financial industry is regulations which we have seen with the most recent financial crisis and which are always at risk of being rolled back at the behest of lobbyists for said financial industry this is just a paragraph of words adds nothing to the discussion why is a plain shirt worth if its from gucci because of artificial scarcity the use value of the object is decoupled from its exchange value in fact it is exactly the ltv which explains that under capitalism goods are used as means of exchange rather than for their direct utility and that this is what enables luxury goods and brandname goods to be a thing in the first place so youre telling me that a person who buys shirts from gucci is using it as a means of exchange i hope you realize that second hand luxury items are sold at a huge discount people buy luxury items is because they believe the items are worth the cost aka an item is only worth as much as people are willing to pay for it why is this such a hard concept to understand i can put hours in to making something but if no one wants it its worth this is a direct contradiction to the ltv
socialism,removed,theres not enough capital to lend out to talented people also on an unrelated note those wall street guys are working at useless jobs lol what do you think wall street is
socialism,removed,maybe sweatshops but its a statistical certainty no black in history has gotten within even a standard deviation of einsteins iq that would be like sigmas above the black mean believing environment matters beyond avoiding brain damage is like believing you can become tall by playing basketball which granted was the official socialist position for a long time
socialism,removed,poor workers have too little genetic intelligence potential for even one in a billion to come close to einstein at least the black ones the chinese peasants might
socialism,removed,why did you slip the genetics into this but really the test measures education keep in mind that gould wrote about this in a book from the even before iq test was just a term of popular science and the cognitive testing itself was developed very far there are of course still tests that measure knowledge but many try to test for other things iq itself is just a mathematical tool now so measured education would still be right but wouldnt imply that nothing changed
socialism,removed,your confusion stems from your kneejerk reaction to project specific thoughts onto me i never mentioned anything about education being equal in fact my other comments express that i dont think everyone gets the same education only that colleges and universities take this information into account when admitting students yet you acted as if i said the uss education system was equal because thats what you wanted to argue about you saw i mentioned someone elses reading comprehension then brought that up as an indicator that i wasnt being clear i countered saying that the comment you failed to understand was understood by everyone else who read it despite the fact that i used the word comment and it rather than comments and them you somehow misconstrued my response to mean that everyone in this thread has understood everything ive said because that was the response you wanted to argue about
socialism,removed,free
socialism,removed,so you go to an impoverished country where people make a living doing subsistence farming digging through trash heaps and other forms of work found in undeveloped countries then you write a law saying free education and healthcare for everybody how does that change the economic reality of that country the country would be better off building exploitative factories and exportable crops rather than trying to build a socialist utopia out of thin air with no economic base a la venezuela
socialism,removed,cotton
socialism,removed,who the fuck is stephen gould
socialism,removed,yeah he is the guy who challenged that other guy from history about cranial capacity and claimed the original guy who did the research was an ignorant racist then it turned out that the other guy was correct and executed his research with integrity and that gould was full of shit and basically just trying to suppress science he didnt like you might want to pick a new scientist to like
socialism,removed,ive never seen a bigger group of delusional people than this subreddit the fuck are yall even talking about in here
socialism,removed,this is a nice sentiment to hold and might make you feel warm and fuzzy inside but it is seperate from reality the fact of the matter is that an extremely small number of people throughout history are responsible for essentially all of the advancement of science we get just a handful of great scientists a century and its been pretty consistent sure some people that may have mattered with proper education probably died in war or poverty but that number is going to be small and without education they would have accomplished nothing anyway
socialism,removed,im sure the people here are referring the soviet army
socialism,removed,theyre
socialism,removed,your getting off the point the point was you should go and help people it could be as simple visiting the elderly at your local nursing home or as complex as helping your local factory workers unionize if you have a spare hour give your spare hour to someone else
socialism,removed,yknow thats a bunch of bullshit i grew up very poor that didnt stop me from doing well enough in high school setting my high schools gpa record to earn enough scholarships to attend a public university with instate tuition i graduated with debt and connections sure it took me a decent amount of time to find a job but that is because i graduated in a struggling economy now i am making more than the median household income in the us and have plenty of room for upward mobility the point is in this system the talent still shines through in a socialist system i wouldnt have had the drive to do what i have done i would have put in minimum effort because more effort than that would not be directly linked to a benefit for me
socialism,removed,its not really brigading if its on page one of rall
socialism,removed,wall street never claimed to be perfect but it is great at collecting and lending out capital in fact its kinda the best system in the world for that purpose
socialism,removed,thats a funny meme coming from this ideology
socialism,removed,stephen jay gould
socialism,removed,because despite what people want to believe very rarely do the genetics line up right to produce someone of the mental caliber of einstein or gauss or newton this isnt something just anyone can do just like not everyone can run a or bench lbs no matter how hard they work at it these super scientists have a genetic advantage that normal people can never compete with it may not be fair but its how it is
socialism,removed,how can op fail to coy that quote in the title
socialism,removed,you dont think the oil boom which led to steel which led to electricity which led to micro chips had anything to do with it
socialism,removed,i mean your just wrong the factor analysis that is used for iq tests is the same one used for all statistical analysis in psychology and most of the social sciences its not an inherently racist concept and it remains to this day the single largest predictor of long term success
socialism,removed,santa claus is not real
socialism,removed,yes because illiterate africans surely had the same mental capacity as one of the most groundbreaking minds in history please this is virtue signalling at its fucking worst
socialism,removed,or in the womb
socialism,removed,wow
socialism,removed,that mans name
socialism,removed,is this serious
socialism,removed,dont worry with socialism theyll all be working in cotton fields and sweatshops d
socialism,removed,bigotry ableism and hate speech will be met with immediate bans socialism is an intrinsically inclusive system and we believe all people are born equal and deserve equal voices in society you all must have never met a real marxist
socialism,removed,if they were so smart they wouldnt have been born into slavery
socialism,removed,or gulags
socialism,removed,tbh i doubt many slaves died in cotton fields no point killing your workers off
socialism,removed,and
socialism,removed,assholecab
socialism,removed,edgy
socialism,removed,thats a side step from the original argument however the argument wasnt that they had been born but that they were never given the chance within that context the aborted fetus never had a chance either
socialism,removed,or those of ukraine who worked the fields only to have the food taken away and given to others
socialism,removed,a slave never had rights so it doesnt matter
socialism,removed,its the dark side of identity politics identity politics is actually a huge part of socialism and true democracy read peter gay the problem is that instead of being used for socialist values displaying peoples amazing equalities through diversity its used to show how terrible group culture can be exploiting people being a part of a small group identity as opposed to their actually being an individual in a collective its like grouping all muslims as extremist terrorists even though statistically far more muslims are peaceful than not you never get a real sense of the individuals that you are calling terrorists and their values characteristics and identities
socialism,removed,the oppression olympics at its finest libs will always eat their own
socialism,removed,your post and this sign is doing exactly that though
socialism,removed,youre still race baiting
socialism,removed,jesus the woman in the pic is bitching about color at a gender based march i would think shes the kind you dont need but white guilt
socialism,removed,lol yes i was god i feel shameful years in the gulag will help me learn for next time
socialism,removed,i didnt read that in one fucking place stop trying to divide peoold even more
socialism,removed,its just funny that the three dumbest looking white bitches are back there posted up
socialism,removed,you wasted sentences on smug shit talking and a half assed excuse
socialism,removed,are you serious from your own source by to more men supported trump than clinton so i guess only trannies are onboard for your revolution at this point fuck off from rsocialism how about ban me because im not going anywhere
socialism,removed,with noobgainz in the thread it gets hard to tell whats what
socialism,removed,but they wore cat ears
socialism,removed,i bet that guy gets so much puss he reminds me of the pc frat in southpark
socialism,removed,and here is a girl lighting a trump supporters hair on fire httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnnerqihscfc
socialism,removed,nationalist socialist german worker party oh the irony
socialism,removed,antiintellectual you cant be serious no wait you can be serious i have to remember we live in a world where people dont let their kids watch the magic school bus because magic is the devils work people can and do sit there and say the magic school bus constitutes antiintellectual how about you take a good long look at yourself while i tell you the seven words that if you heed in all relationships will change your life i dont feel youre listening to me were not talking particle physics were talking american literature just because you dont understand it doesnt make me somehow antiintellectual you are just exactly harassing me because of your own personal ignorance are you not looking at yourself right now do you not feel foolish if you dont feel foolish then i give up
socialism,removed,the agent provocateurs are out in force to divide and conquer there are many nonsocialists posting in this thread this thread is itself a piece of propaganda designed to create the very effect youve described the purpose and effect of posing this image has been to create an unappealing environment that drives people away from rsocialism
socialism,removed,true
socialism,removed,not really trying to suggest anything just confused about this entire picture really
socialism,removed,as concerned as people are about the seemingly large number of racists and fascists in this country that have come out of hiding im far more concerned about the number of violenceloving liberals that are coming out of hiding 😳 am i honestly the only liberal on the internet that hates violence and actually wants and promotes peace this is embarrassing
socialism,removed,the guy who hit him is sick and mentally ill
socialism,removed,hate bring more hate violence brings more violence
socialism,removed,im glad trump won and im not an accelerationist i just care more about sovereign nations like libya or iraq not bring invaded left and right
socialism,removed,you should post them to rfellowkids im sure theyre great
socialism,removed,being walked on come on the guy was just speaking in front of a camera and got assaulted as much as i disagree with him i has the right to voice is opinion these violent protesters makes us look bad and we are seen as retards who cant
socialism,removed,try harder with the trolling trolls are not allowed here reported
socialism,removed,spencer is an httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiagentprovocateur he colluded with the person who punched him so he could make this a meme im saying he and the guy who hit him were both in on it he is trying to incite a backlash against protestors by making himself a victim and gaining sympathy do not feed into this people who attack him help his cause
socialism,removed,perfect because it was all planned httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiagentprovocateur he is trying to turn people against peacful protestors by gaining sympathy for himself and casting them as the violent ones do not feed into this you are only helping him
socialism,removed,it is an educated opinion based on several factors historically agents provocateurs have always operated during peaceful protest movements you can read some of the history in the wikipedia link so when we see things like this happen we have to consider that it might be true try to put everything together look at the person who hit him clad all in black with his face wellcovered it wasnt just a random act who else was dressed in black with their faces wellcovered the people waving anarchist flags who broke windows and set the limo on fire we shouldnt trust that they are anarchists either they could be white supremacists or some other group like okeefe has made a career out of committing fraudulent acts and was fined for shelp that brought down acorn who is okeefe commected to thats right who does breitbart serve as a megaphone for thats right the pepe loving altright see how this all comes together heres the thing though even if my theory is unprovable or even incorrect the result is the same people who commit violent acts during peaceful protests only undermine the cause hitting this guy will only gain him sympathy and make him a martyr and take away the moral high ground from peaceful protestors the best thing we can do is ignore him and pretend he doesnt exist unless we are helping others connect the dots in the way i am here
socialism,removed,hows that working out with trump voters do you think ive seen them use it as a tool to against socialists i have news for you the socialist cause needs both liberals and trump voters if you ever want to be more than a small group of misanthropes
socialism,removed,so you want to be a perpetrator of violence but are afraid to suffer the possible consequences of standing up for your ideals sounds like a coward to me maybe the reason these people were assassinated was because the ruling class understood the great power inherent in their approach and prefered to have violence be the face of their causes because it is not effective ever think of that
socialism,removed,wait you guys are proud of the genocide
socialism,removed,so is the soviet union the desired outcome for you
socialism,removed,whats the confusion after revolution we purged tens millions bourgeois this time we will need many more
socialism,removed,and we know how well that turned out for the ussr
socialism,removed,then have fun having your ideas relegated to the trash pile of history meanwhile people like me will be channeling our energy into more helpful actions how many profiles do you have in this thread anyway batman do you work for spencer or okeefe or bannon and breitbart doing a little postinauguratiin infiltration maybe youre working for them either knowingly and directly or unknowingly and indirectly
socialism,removed,its okay you are what hardcore socialists and communists refer to as a useful idiot if a revolution happens and you refuse to kill bourgeois people you yourself will be killed for helping them youre useful in getting the revolution started but if youre afraid to do the dirty work the real revolutionaries will have no problem disposing of you
socialism,removed,youre on the socialism subreddit these people clearly didnt study history
socialism,removed,youre socialists you either like mass murder or you dont know history
socialism,removed,you support the stupidest fucking ideology of all time
socialism,removed,if it is peaceful it cant be genocide though forcing people to move is not genocide
socialism,removed,idiot adults you have capable engineers building all of this technology and only with resources provided by owners of capital lol
socialism,removed,love how this subreddit bans dissent from the fantasy i got banned from the donald too what does it say about your world view that you cant tolerate differing opinions keep dreaming everyone someday you can make the whole world like venezuela
socialism,removed,communism doesnt work marx himself said youd need new people to do that you should rather concentrate on how to transform capitalism into something that works humans are both selfish and social but capitalism promotes the selfishness eg if youre a business man and you shrink the wages of your workers or you bribe politicians to lower your taxes you are rewarded by having more money and hence more power and wealth you would need a system in which this kinda things are not merely impossible but pointless
socialism,removed,so because some people here are prone to having an emotionally charged reaction to this situation or scenarios like it i should be more sympathetic towards those who condone assault thats some logic you got there i understand this sub has been hijacked by radical feminists and pseudointellectual hipsters but it really is disheartening to see how identity politics are beginning to completely dominate this sub
socialism,removed,maybe because they are aware how idiotic the ideology is
socialism,removed,holy shit this is edgy you cried after trying to teach your friends about marx its high school not the paris commune
socialism,removed,how is indiscriminate and random attacks on trump supporters selfdefense though that is what is the overarching strategy and goals that this tactic pushes
socialism,removed,but is it right to automatically assume that everybody who supports trump is a fascist and worthy of indiscriminate violent attacks and also if a violent attack on an event fails to actually silence the speechpropaganda doesnt that mean that now youve drawn more attention to the message and thus increased its spread
socialism,removed,so much jealousy
socialism,removed,but do they though last i saw trumps stance on trade deals was as much a motivator as his racistxenophobic rants but either way im still not at all convinced that indiscriminate violence against your average protrump schmuck is the way to go and i dont see why the threat of violence is the best way to shake up the schmucks who are ignorant of the racistprofascist core of trumpism especially in the virtual absence of counterorganizing efforts by radical leftists
socialism,removed,awesome news one less of them is always a good thing staten island is the best
socialism,removed,can you be specific political prisons gays etc etc etc when someone goes there you know they have nothing etc etc etc after two examples one of which she already addressed what a fucking cunt
socialism,removed,so what im trying to get at is can we be socialistic with the technology we have now
socialism,removed,once he came to power he still killed his own people
socialism,removed,ok ok i see where you are going with this for example correct me if im wrong but a true socialistic society goes as follows the best brightest minds or those who just want to helpwork gets together and build the best cellphone for all people society thus no competition however it will still improve on the designs as new ideas or new requests are being made hence the resources needed to make x amount of cellphones are used and not wasted on products that just stay on the store shelves also there wont be any planned obsolescence right hence make cell phones last for a long time that are also compatible to upgrades etc and the cell phone company can still make profits but the ownership of the cell phone company is owned by the peoplemakers of the cell phone right would this be an example of an ideal situation in a socialistic society
socialism,removed,do you think socialism cant be possible without higher forms of technology aka robots doing manual labor and producing a constant supply of good foodwithout disrupting our natural environment
socialism,removed,well after his whole accelerationist bulls spit ive come to conclusion that slavoj is actually an intelligent person masquerading as insanity for the left to constantly be on about its almost like that fan theory of the show the office where some people actually think michael scott acts the way he acts because hes trying to make a mockery of the whole camera crew filming him the character is fully intelligent and is really just trying to get a rise out of everyone and that hes not a dumb manager when the paper company is sharing experiences in solving problems and getting over insane arguments boom michael scott comes in with a hot take or jab that seems completely ridiculous and makes the company wonder why hes been around for so long thats literally what i see today were all trying to strive and see what leftist message we need in order to guide us into the next year or decade we find ourselves in weird arguments and strange leftist thought processes when all of a sudden boom theres slavoj with some crazy jab that makes all of the cameras pan over and zoom into is face while the rest of use are thinking what the hell but in a weird way were all back here talking about him right hes getting interviewed hes a meme sniff and so but hes written important works and teaches somewhere important not sure if hes a leftist really at all tbh hes definitely insane but that insanity is what the left needs and not what it wants
socialism,removed,nah its you man i was just in a village in the sayadri range and even there theyre more pro modi than anything and also pro demonitsation also calling modi a fascist really man i mean his party is full of shitty people who like to play identity politics but so is the entire country modi is doing a decent job not a good one but a decent one which is more than what can be said for the past years and at least the upper echelons of his party are good like gadkari is doing some good work so yeah only petite bourgeoisie are against this and theyre the ones whose opinions you have
socialism,removed,brother i have lived in india for all my life i know exactly what the rss is and while it is a nationalist circle jerk certainly not fascist also modi didnt lead anything man whether he was complicit i do not know but it seems youre taking your outsider perspective a little too far i wouldnt vote for modi as of now but all the things youre calling him are completely stupid to be honest he has a plan and while it might not be a good one and the execution is not great its happening and i dont think its all bad and anyways the point was that the poor dont like modi which is completely wrong also thanks for that downvote for trying to debate you and add to the discussion whether it was you or someone else entirely
socialism,removed,im with whoever is gonna remove the ableist speech rule
socialism,removed,thatll be a cold day in hell
socialism,removed,nope there was a class system in cuba there will be a class system until we go through extinction
socialism,removed,youre missing context the first half was mostly correct and jnu was a fiasco and a half but nothing to be compared with the blackshirts or brownshirts the part about founding you said that he was a fan of hitler and mussolini but you forget who was ruling india back then it was the british and gandhi had made it easier for them to loot the country y stopping all revolts that got violent mostly due to the british starting it so where do all the nationalist revolutionarys look even subhash chandra bose shook hands with hitler and he was a staunch socialist who took the fight to the british with the help of the imperial japanese they took help from where they got it and im sure the axis was more than willing to destabilise colonys belonging to the uk
socialism,removed,castro is a leninist meaning he never intended to give the power to the workers and if it meant he had to lose one of his rolexs to help some poor family out he wouldnt do it
socialism,removed,im not saying the cuban revolution was bad just that the castro regime is authoritarian and didnt actually care about implementing full communism theyre an authoritarian class based social democratic state nothing more
socialism,removed,fuck castro he was a bigoted fascist dictator im glad that bastards dead
socialism,removed,youre comfortable ignoring the atrocities he was responsible for surely this subs view of what socialism should be cant be castros cuba
socialism,removed,biology biology in overules any social constructions or belief systems better learn how to change biology than saying meaningless wannabe statements like a teenager learn science
socialism,removed,when omenklatura is bettter its a class system when straight are better than homosexuals its a class system when habaneros get more than pinareños its a class system i can go on and on those motherfuckers have used a beautiful ideology to get everything for themselves and the others around them fuck them
socialism,removed,said from his ivory tower
socialism,removed,im far right and interested in understanding each others world view anyone would like to argue on skypediscord apologize if its the wrong place to ask but this is the latest post here and i feel like it doesnt deserve a thread to make myself as for your question sjw is supposed to be ironic mostly for people who care too much about non issues like pronouns and trigger words etc
socialism,removed,oh but i forgot this sub is a huge supporter of firing squads and locking up people who have a different political opinion that you by the way that was a second google search
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,any recommendations
socialism,removed,honestly lets not normalize a dictator who has done a lot to hurt the people he ruled over castro was a piece of shit end of story
socialism,removed,its what they called themeselves they made themeselves an insult by having retarded logic and insulting random people on the internet tldr talk shit get hit
socialism,removed,clearly the comrades on this sub are too lazy to google so heres the wikipedia page httpsenmwikipediaorgwikihumanrightsincuba socialism worked so well that million people left the great socialist island to go to the evil capitalist america
socialism,removed,because you either a wont google or b are too lazy to google httpsenmwikipediaorgwikihumanrightsincuba
socialism,removed,once again too lazy to google httpsenmwikipediaorgwikicubanexile
socialism,removed,well i think we have to draw the line at certain ideological points i think some of the revolutionaries who fought alongside him hoped that cuba would turn into a democracy no we cant seriously believe that for his entire life he had to act as if he was still at war and take over any and all political opposition i mean ive also seen argued that since the us was constantly trying to kill him that yes we should consider all these years to have been wartime relations im no pro on cuban political history i just feel like there were human rights abuses vs journalists and political opposing views some of which were not simply capitalist pigsbut democrats
socialism,removed,its like feminism originaly a good idea but fucked up by some ppl taking it way over board
socialism,removed,its used as an insult because everyone knows that most of you arent sincere and oft times even you know youre not actually sincere and just putting up a front for virtue points you went into this argument with the idea that you duped everyone into believing that there was any actual sincerity behind your sjw shtick
socialism,removed,who are you or castro to decide that they should have their things taken and be exiled was that the only way to make thing right no why dont we take all of your things and send you to a neighboring country
socialism,removed,leads to a phishing site it leads to the universitys brick and mortar library and i dont get your point about germany yeah they have a state social welfare system but their economy is capitalist like every other socialist country with its head above water
socialism,removed,i do know and im hoping that people here are open enough to read someones opinion and talk about it rather than just down vote anyone who has a different perspective what im saying is that normalizing dictatorship is wrong in my opinion and socialism only works if everyone in that society agrees to its principles otherwise its just stealing from people who produce
socialism,removed,ohno leddit commies is gonna invade seriously though youre a faggot
socialism,removed,google is not a reliable source than what is you idiot the communist manifesto
socialism,removed,i wonder if granma the official voice of the communist party of cuba central committee straight from their website is an unbiased source come on guys
socialism,removed,said by a man who lived in riches while others live in ghettos and the building around them ruined by time
socialism,removed,i understand that youre exaggerating but you cant seriously consider a statement from the official voice of the communist party news
socialism,removed,i think when people talk about sjws they talk about people who get triggered when someone unintentionally calls a genderfluid person he or she
socialism,removed,i honestly cant believe there are people that idolized fidel castro
socialism,removed,i still dont get why that excuses him for treating his people like shit and before you go off on me know that i am a leftist whose father escaped cuba with his family when he was five
socialism,removed,i see your point and obviously you can tell im a capitalist but i just dont think fidel castro is the best person to celebrate communism wheres theres better people like marx and engels who didnt kill people for political points
socialism,removed,yes people die but plunging cuba into debt with help from the us is not exactly a leader who should be a revolutionary also not allowing simple freedoms such as speech isnt even true communism or socialism at that look at lenin who atleast did something
socialism,removed,oh im sorry i guess i forgot to mention that my family left because my grandfather was thrown into jail for saying something against castro surely he treated everyone well my bad
socialism,removed,just stumbled across this i find it amusing that youre so blinded by ideology that youve accused a successful professional software developer of not being able to use a computer classic ironic socialist smugness it is impossible to create caricatures of you clowns anymore there isnt room left
socialism,removed,the fact that that landlords have rooms to rent and bosses have jobs to give are the fruits of their labor is someone giving away free property and i missed it i want to be a landlord in that case you are taking the fruits of other peoples labor brother if you want to live in a place that someone else built that an owner financed and say it should just be yours because a landlord doesnt make anything well i just cant get on board with that ownership of real property land or buildings is just a physical manifestation of the work youve produced
socialism,removed,well he did have a net worth of million us dollars
socialism,removed,my family doesnt talk about it i was told they were friends and then they disagreed and that was the result they joke and say its because my abuelo told castro to fuck off i need to press them on this and find out more i disagree that dissent requires that type of action
socialism,removed,sjwism is a bad thing when it goes beyond justice and into the realms of arbitrary correctness limitation of free speech thought policing what one can or cant do because doing it might god forbid offend someone or positive discrimination taken too far you end up with a system where anyone not toeing the party line anyone who disagrees with or voices an opinion against the status quo is held to be practically criminal i will leave you with
socialism,removed,he had others killed after he took power he was a murdering no good son of a witch
socialism,removed,it is a woman had a miscarriage but then threw the remains in a dumpster the doctors suspected infanticide called the cops once it was sorted out she was released
socialism,removed,the woman was arrested for suspected infanticide since she had a miscarriage and threw the remains into a dumpster the doctors believed the baby maybe was far enough along that it could have been a live birth after it was worked out she was released
socialism,removed,salon nice one you should ask cnn if trump has a chance to win the election oh wait
socialism,removed,there is still time
socialism,removed,ordered abortion pills online past the week legal period gave birth to a living creature and left it in a dumpster yeah keep telling yourself mike pence is the monster in this story
socialism,removed,and pence was involved with any of that shittyness or was a pos da
socialism,removed,donald trump is by all accounts actually as dumb as he appears pence is an intelligent politician with an agenda that is truly evil
socialism,removed,my wife would be dead is cunts like him got their way pardon my french
socialism,removed,interesting discussion on this post
socialism,removed,i agree there is a line i disagree that castro drew a fair one im still waiting to hear from other family but this is what my aunt has to say just so you understand how this effected us directly your grandfather was put in jail for speaking against fidel he was beaten for two weeks straight the reason they used was he sat on the porch with only an undershirt he stayed in jail for months then every other week he was arrested again your grandfather had a butcher shop and fidel took this from him as he did to many others your grandmother was forced to leave her family at the age of and make a new life with nothing but the shirts in their backs your dad was only two when they got to the u s and your uncle well he was a bun in the oven as your grandmother was already months pregnant and you were not allowed to leave if you were pregnant my parents made the choice to come not for them but to insure a better life for their kids i hope this gives you a glimpse of why you were born in the usa
socialism,removed,in the state personal freedom has existed only for the individuals who developed within the relationships of the ruling class and yet you socialists think we need a bigger state
socialism,removed,died just shy of the comma club he eas nearly as rich as jami dimon and lloyd blanfeinb ceos of and gs
socialism,removed,if you can kill one president you can kill two presidents
socialism,removed,seems the salon story was a little misleading
socialism,removed,the salon story is highly misleading
socialism,removed,a guy who had former supporters killed for disagreeing with his ideas when he got in power while living to himself is saying that there will be a classless hierarchyless society for all of us
socialism,removed,if you have a good police force then yes good people good training good results
socialism,removed,is a social worker a member of the working class or the poor
socialism,removed,no im just asking you a question sorry for offending you
socialism,removed,sotrying to prevent stop crime
socialism,removed,so you believe that the laws we have now are objectively correct the opposite of objective is not arbitrary and the fact that laws are invented according to the will of humans does not make them unreasonable in fact i would hope that a reasoned approach would be taken by any state in the creation and application of law using the state as a moral compass of sorts is mistake in what way is this statement at all relevant to anything i said i said nothing of a standard of morality you are jumping to conclusions the view the state holds is meaningless and subject to change the fact that something is subject to change does not render it meaningless in fact the purpose of the change may be to render a thing more meaningful than it once was or it can be to do the opposite youre making huge logical leaps without any apparent reason furthermore if the law as established by a government which represents the people is somehow subjective and arbitrary what makes a law that is established by some other form of government superior why would a law by say a monarchy or a truly marxist regime be more objective and more rational
socialism,removed,i imagine it looks something like this
socialism,removed,he has daddy issues
socialism,removed,i can give many realworld examples of anarchy that you definitely would not want to live in can you give me one that you would
socialism,removed,nah by all means the mods can ban me im a supporter of many socialist positions but banning a defense of the police is just idiotic
socialism,removed,i thought police enforced the law
socialism,removed,i make love to your sevenyear old daughter after tying you up and gluing your eyes open oa v i put a gun to her head and make her say shes been naughty and deserves this ejaculate and then pull the trigger but its okay because anarchy right
socialism,removed,the usa isnt the guardian of earth
socialism,removed,if socialism is a slight off shoot of communism wouldnt you need the police how are we suppose to take everyones money they arent going to just hand it over
socialism,removed,isnt the point of law enforcement to enforce the law
socialism,removed,i a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority or other controlling systems ii absence of government and absolute freedom of the individual ¯ツ¯
socialism,removed,i thought the police enforce the law
socialism,removed,having no official moral compass leaves all of us less safe i do not care about you or yours the world has taught me better the state keeps you safe from me taking your shit your idea of moral relativism still relies on a mandated morality otherwise there will always be a larger group of people who are undeterred due to a lack of official morality
socialism,removed,im sure you do its fits your narrative doesnt make it true but im sure it sounds lovely to you
socialism,removed,i think police is a necessary evil if we want to keep the neofascists under control
socialism,removed,just because you think you dont want police doesnt mean that everyone else who wants them is somehow wrong all of you people trying to paint the entire police force as one way or another are the actual problem here there are millions of leos who go to work each day and actually help society and the are some that fuck society up the same can be said about teachers or presidents or congresspeople or lawyers or mechanics im not saying there isnt a problem but good god damn the problem isnt there are police
socialism,removed,having bad experiences with cops also shades your perspective its called bias
socialism,removed,yep this place sucks i mean sks teehee
socialism,removed,the guy gave you a fucking list that spans centuries all evidencing the fact that letting the public handle these matters is a terrible idea first line out of your mouth i think you need to do more research kid stfu
socialism,removed,the guy is asking one line questions without any obvious catches they arent loaded but your skin is so paper fucking thin
socialism,removed,i am here to avenge ulostmywayboston do your worst mods

socialism,removed,lifts indexfinger like most islamists
socialism,removed,they do but the commenter in question appears to be saying that to defend the police we could have explained that the law is precisely where the police draw their oppressive power from but hell never hear that now because hes banned
socialism,removed,maybe because hes bringing times more profit to the company than the average worker not that hes necessarily working times harder

socialism,removed,the only problem is there is not an easy way to asses each womans need i believe it would lead to women taking days off that dont really need it what criteria could be used in this scenario to judge each individuals needs
socialism,removed,fuck you socialist scum
socialism,removed,the low wages is a symptom of a non functional society raising the minimum wage wont fix the underlying problem its like putting icing on a bad cake it wont make the cake taste good

socialism,removed,if you hate companies so much start your own company mate what
socialism,removed,please stop embarrassing yourself its making me cringe
socialism,removed,having a communist meeting against transphobiareactionaries nearly every communist movement outside of reddit is transphobic homophobic and conservative ie communist party of the russian federation communist party of china polish socialist party polish united workers party communist party of ukraine etc if you ask absolutely anybody from the parties above they will say that liberation of workers rights comes first in communism and equality among everybody will shortly follow i already know im going to be banned for commenting this but all of you pseudocommunists have no idea the first thing about it apart from what tumblr thinks
socialism,removed,you want welfare for the working class bwhahahaahahahahahaha
socialism,removed,i wonder if youd shed a tear if she was a nazi or an italian fascist
socialism,removed,fuck you communism has never worked and never will basically theres the left to right wing scale and than top to bottom at the far left is extreme socialism which is an economic failure extreme top left communism which insanely bad and bottom left is anarchism which is where theres no business or government or peace or anything they all think chaos is good and it liberates people just cause theres no bosses these people are insane social democracy is a combination of equality socialism and innovation capitalism along with some order government and some freedom free speech and democracy i wanted t talk to my fellow socialists here but you guys are really extreme and have never read a history book
socialism,removed,national socialism has nothing to do with wanting to leave the eu national socialism was nothing more than the violent wing of the german socialist party at the time deutsche arbeiterpartei just as the original fascist groups were violent marxists from the italian socialist party their analogues today would be the uaf look in the fucking mirror
socialism,removed,zero
socialism,removed,more like an hero by cop
socialism,removed,upvote if your family wasnt annihilated in stalins purges downvote if youre an ignorant western imperialist
socialism,removed,cause its true
socialism,removed,it basically said that their ideology was neither right or left but a mix well they did take some stuff from the left support for bigger pensions and profit sharing for example theyre still farright though ona very superficial basis theyre economically centrist
socialism,removed,you were downvoted not by me i might add because you didnt express the idea and intent behind that post clearly enough and so people including myself jumped to a different conclusion than the intended one it looked like a glib comment of the kind that shows up here from time to time where someone from outside the movement dips in drops a oneliner about how dumb socialism is and then promptly leaves i gave you an actual upvote to try and stem the tide fwiw
socialism,removed,this from what i understand the nazis basically took the term socialism as a branding move more than anything
socialism,removed,is it a problem in your eyes that one would find distateful the use of mindless violence against others to further ones own political agenda
socialism,removed,what do i do with all these horse shoes
socialism,removed,try as i might everything ive seen has shown me that the bolsheviks had a very negative effect on the world we could start with the purges induced famine forced migration cultural and religious suppression gulags concentration camps forced settlement forced labour i could go on but the misery and suffering the soviet union brought upon the world is completely and utterly unjustifiable i believe that a successful communist state is possible but the soviet union is very much so a failed state from constant underproduction to overproduction brought upon by their inability to operate a successful planned economy to me being a socialist entails free health care keeping people well fed free education and most importantly the ability to provide support to people depending on their need so as to ensure that everyone has an equal ability to make something of their lives not fanatically and systematically eliminating anyone who even breaths a word against the state as was in the soviet union
socialism,removed,as a student of orwell i wont be celebrating
socialism,removed,they were free but they werent particularity good as for food they werent particularly varied and at times food was scarce yes people were empowered for a time but one needs to only take a look at the uk for example where many industries were nationalised and education and healthcare were free yet quality of life was leaps and bounds ahead of the ussr
socialism,removed,well you could i as italian wouldnt like that much the power the us are in trump hands ibelieve that hillary at least is somewhat reasonable
socialism,removed,they provided them but they werent particularly good as for the british american greed and imperialist designs led to them loaning out massive loans to the british at high interest rates the great war brought the british empire to the brink on bankruptcy but my point was the sheer loss of life suffering and repressing they brought to eastern europe is simply not worth it im more talking about after during attlees britain
socialism,removed,nah shes already started the red baiting on her news networks us american commies will be demonized under either candidate
socialism,removed,wasnt expressing it in any way i was just mistaken on the nazis political views there are several comments below correcting me stating that he killed of any left side of the party and made it fully facist and discriminatory
socialism,removed,i just responded to you in another comment so this reply with be brief thank you for sharing your perspective with me i am from the north east coast and have lived in a large city my entire life i feel grateful that you shared your southern perspective with me i agree it is a human story and the sooner we begin to see it that way the stronger we will become
socialism,removed,oppression olympics stopped reading there
socialism,removed,guess what there is nothing great about being poor regardless of your skin color andor gender im so tired of idpol im not interested in all these isms and groups howd i know you were a racist
socialism,removed,its almost like the fbi is full of different people than it was years ago
socialism,removed,afrocentric marxism is holding back africa incompetent leaders promise everything to these uneducated farmers and city workers and always fail miserably im serious when i say a new kind of socialist colonialism could be good for africa they are still too incompetent to rule themselves this may sound racist but i would say that in all poor african countries the people are not educated enough to elect a real leader instead they elect a demagogue each time
socialism,removed,i mean as confederate generals go lee definitely the most humane granted thats a fairly low bar
socialism,removed,as someone who suffers from depression i find your phrase never really wanted to learn very offensive as it shows no sympathy to the motivationally challenged s
socialism,removed,very true i think we have to nationalize the healthcare sector
socialism,removed,hehehe screw stalin anarchy
socialism,removed,question is image of a feline sexist against women keep in mind that the gender fluidity of cartoon characters such as bugs bunny could be seen as quite progressive and empowering
socialism,removed,we need to defeat and destroy them with our numbers billion people could eradicate all million vile yanks if they wanted to
socialism,removed,why bring race into politics when has that ever resulted in anything good if we see each other just as other people disregarding their skin color and background we could actually get along but instead its a non stop circle jerk
socialism,removed,they seem to hate capitalism in the west and aim to replace it with a better society through any means necessary sincerely sir as a part of the west i am inclined to oppose that just get the hell out if youre going to be cardcarryingly evil
socialism,removed,then what are the most successful socialist states for the workers
socialism,removed,that afghan muslim doesnt love you if you are a dirty kafir makes you grateful you dont live in a muslim majority country dont it
socialism,removed,quotations from chairman mao stars he was on the right track but waay too soft
socialism,removed,castro was a brutal dictator i have family from cuba who all fled to live here due to castro batista was bad but castro was a million times worse
socialism,removed,so treating everyone equal to go into the military is now racism whats next white people riding in the back of the bus now
socialism,removed,yay going from shitty fascism to shittier socialism
socialism,removed,it is
socialism,removed,yes but it takes a few lives when i say few i mean millions
socialism,removed,one of the problems i see continually happening is the places people want to live as you described them wind up eating themselves what i mean by this is once a place becomes desirable it gets converted into more housing frequently removing the very thing that makes it desirable such as condos displacing the grocery store that used to be within walking distance or just massively increasing the amount of people which drives people batty
socialism,removed,non violent solutions are difficult just keep tagging and vandalizing the colonizers and their kitschy sculptures of bicycles or some shit they didnt even bother to weld or paint before slapping a price tag on it thats the resistance mentality where i live and i dont see any better option
socialism,removed,soviet union ish perhaps the european states too arguably yugoslavia china cuba isnt the death toll for all those around million
socialism,removed,israel isnt an apartheid state
socialism,removed,this is ridiculous ethiopians dont face anywhere near the challenges of african americans and some want to avoid service thats like if mexican americans refused to pay taxes because of racist cops
socialism,removed,its like he picks people who hate jews for his cabinet but loves likud at the same time almost like he doesnt understand issues weird
socialism,removed,also from dc here but are you implying that the crime in places like anacostia isnt the fault of its residents i think it most definitely is they dont have to break into cars and homes i get the poverty angle but they dont have to do it i am in the process of trying to purchase a property right now as a matter of fact and there are some great affordable properties in ne but every single neighborhood is sketchy as hell i would love to be able to support the economy here and plant some firmer roots but it is not worth the risk to my family gentrification is inevitable and honestly long term it is for the better youve got families in some of these houses who have been there for decades and have not put a single cent into upkeep of the property and one day some yuppy like me is gonna waltz in and drop on top of them thinking about it rationally i dont see the problem here everybody wins
socialism,removed,if they is the government then no police and people are certainly racist at times but that doesnt constitute apartheid
socialism,removed,gulag s
socialism,removed,puleeze black youth will just vote democrat anyway because its the party that gives them welfare money and coddles them as victims against they evil oppressors the police whites and tea partiers its not like they have a vested interest in society theyre not stakeholders just leeches who produce very little of value yet receive enormous amounts of taxpayer money also the crime
socialism,removed,insane
socialism,removed,praise science
socialism,removed,that wasnt antisemitism it was ridiculing the people who jumped on the echoes bandwagon in order to score points with the establishment wikileaks is still stating true to its mission their twitter stream has gotten a little unhinged this week understandably they want to take full advantage of the attention
socialism,removed,if we lived in a patriarchal society shouldnt men face less prison time then women moreover my fault i misread your comment no i dont consider myself a feminist because there is no longer drastic inequalities between men and women in the united states
socialism,removed,bob already got some food but instead of eating it he threw the plate against the wall then he picked up a sharp ceramic chard and starting swinging it around very fast in an unpredictable and threatening manor
socialism,removed,the patriot act was not designed to catch bin laden it also gave the govt some powers it didnt have before its not like the robotbomb is something new the govt couldnt legally do before nor was it like they couldnt kill folks in the name of law enforcement before either
socialism,removed,so he was a feeling and got caught with illegal guns and drugs whats the problem here
socialism,removed,i think traditional bullets and other military equipment would be more effective have you ever seen a bombdisposal robot they move at about a quarter of a normal walking space plus in the event of a revolt im assuming theyd be some kind of insurgency right theyd probably using all those robots to actually disarm bombs placed by folks revolting when they want to kill the people revolting well like i said there are more effective means as i said in this thread everyones overly focused on this one incident it doesnt change anything or reflect a new capacity the govt has
socialism,removed,i honestly think its pretty cool they blew him up with it
socialism,removed,i mean he was damn sure more than suspected it was obvious to everyone that this was the guy that was killing people and he wasnt going to let himself be taken alive from an objective point of view using a drone to kill him seems to be the most logical course of action in this situation of course im not saying that this doesnt set a dangerous precedent but in this particular case what was the alternative try to arrest him and risk more deaths
socialism,removed,im not sure you know what indiscriminate means the guy had specific targets the police thats why i said he indiscriminately targeted police he had no idea who these specific police officers were what they had done what their jobs were etc one was a rapidtransit police officer i cant imagine he ever did anything to deserve that death now if i had said he indiscriminately targeted people that would be inaccurate because he was only targeting specific people the police
socialism,removed,represent the blank face of state violence the same was said when firearms were introduced you shoot from afar you dont really see the suffering of the person youre killing a sword is brutal and you need guts to kill someone while a gun is more impersonal go tell that to veterans with ptsd and nightmares about the people they killed the same could be said for remote killing dont call them robots or drones it sucks the guy that detonated it still had to face the target through a camera and he know hes the one that terminated his life
socialism,removed,riddle me this what exactly could be the relevant difference between those situations and this one dylann roof was caught attempting to flee in his car unlike micah johnson he wasnt interested in dying for his cause right there and then when confronted by police dylann roof also decided not to use the pistol on his person to engage in a firefight micah johnson when confronted by police shot one of them and was able to retreat to a better position to continue his fight james holmes was arrested after the aurora shooting because following his massacre he put down his weapons and stood next to his car in the parking lot smoking a cig he had no intention of running and put up no resistance again unlike micah johnson when given the chance to surrender he took it and unlike johnson wanst interested in engaging the police so theres your answer theres a world of difference between these cases but the primary thing is the suspects decision to surrender or die fighting
socialism,removed,guilty of death you fucking idiot eye for an eye is archaic for good reason a black guy gets shot and its justified that or more cops that had zero direct involvement with the incident get fucking shot in some twisted retaliation this is a tragedy everybody has a family whether it be their mourning parents wife kids whatever its disgusting people here cant empathize with a death
socialism,removed,or we should stop with the whataboutism all together
socialism,removed,that is complete nonsense most white us american rightwing extremism doesnt happen in the form of these largescale attacks but in smaller altercations youve also got to include every abortion clinic attack every gay attack every police murder etc they happen incredibly frequently and those numbers add up fast
socialism,removed,the left thinks all terrorism is rightwing especially their own lmao
socialism,removed,this christ this sub is embarassing its trying to spin facts to create a pro socialism narrative but it cant even be bothered to do it properly at least when thedonald or rpolitics or spins something they put some effort in step up your game
socialism,removed,you dont think there are left wing cops that is definitely the dumbest thing i have heard today you also realize that of cops never kill anyone right
socialism,removed,lol you call them fascists but want their sub shut down
socialism,removed,pretty extreme if youre trying to get people on board i know this sub is not about us politics but if you want to open western culture to the reality of socialism this probably isnt the way friggin decades of propaganda demonizing socialismcommunism as one in the same perpetuates today im betting if you showed this to a class of graders they have perceived it as bad that being said this is a random reddit post and is not nearly as serious as my comment might make it out to be lol
socialism,removed,when worldwide conflict arises from global warming and a scarcity of resources then the mass killing of people abroad is justified for the survival of american civilization a gorilla in a jungle has to fight for limited resources why is this different on the global scale for humans and human civilization
socialism,removed,my parents are from the ussr a country like that should never exist again
socialism,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikimensrightsmovementissues i dont think that we shouldnt marginalise the problems that people face whether theyre white whether theyre black whether theyre latino whether theyre men whether theyre women whether theyre trans i dont care the oppressed classes need to stand together and fight for social justice for all rather than blaming each other the issues they face the notion that these people need to be catered to by those who are oppressed is pure ego lets start with what the word catered means provide with what is needed or required the school caters to children with learning difficulties what you are saying here is that one group of oppressed people need to be marginalised and dismissed by a another group of people because the first group of people less oppressed than the other group that does not matter if a group of people is oppressed or marginalised or whatever it is we need to stand up up and fight for them if you are against oppression you should be against oppression of all groups of people we need to stand in solidarity as you yourself have said and im going to emphasise the importance of grounding this bullshit we are talking about oppression not hurt feelings or stubbed toes losing custody of your child receiving no assistance after being raped being a victim of domestic abuse and being unable to receive any sort of help being as likely to commit suicide having to work longer hours i could go on this is not about hurt feelings or stubbing your toe these are legitimate issues that you are clearly marginalising and dismissing entirely from your comments in this thread it seems clear that you believe that it fines to blame white men for the problems that are faced by other classes white men were born into this society just like a black man or a black women or whomever was born into this society we didnt create this society we were born into it many of us see the injustice in this society and are fighting to change it as a white man i am no more responsible for the society that we live in then the black woman that lives across the street to blame me for the problems of society is ridiculous i did not create this society and i am fighting to change it this is what people are talking about when they say that youre alienating people you marginalise the problems of whites men cis and say that theyre nothing more than hurt feelings or a stubbed toe then you blame them for the society that in which they were born into and are fighting to change white cis men arent to blame because they we born white or because they were born as men or because they are cis stop shaming them and stop trying to blame them for being being born into this society as white cis males to blame white cis men for the society in which they were born is not only incorrect they did not create this problem but were born into it but to blame and marginalise them for the gender or for the sex that they were born into is not only morally outrageous but it is also indistinguishable from the racism sexism and discrimination that you claim to be opposed to
socialism,removed,interesting quote heres another one from him i have never admired a white man but the greatest of them to my mind was hitler
socialism,removed,he represents me just as much as trump most members of the working class aim to be wealthy some day just like trump and the executives he chooses i see them as individuals who worked and prospered what youre saying looks like an attempt to sew division between the have and havenots america is about equal opportunity not equal result most trump voters understand that the rich are not evil because they are rich if theyre corrupt and we find out then well be at the gates like anyone else for now trump is americas hope the alternative was simply unacceptable maybe your definition of country ownership is skewed to me to own ones country means that the people have more power than the government i do appreciate your time but im a son of my founding fathers we rebelled for the exact reasons youre outlining and formed our own country to be governed of by and for the people you may think its impossible for the people to own their country but ill fight and die for that idea like so many before me before i accept globalism and everything it entails apparently that means we have to accept massive amounts of muslim refugees who hate our guts and refuse to assimilate germany is a great example of where globalism is trying to take the world am i barking up the wrong tree id honestly feel bad if i was directing this at you in error i feel like socialism communism and globalism all have a common core they seem to hate capitalism in the west and aim to replace it with a better society through any means necessary sincerely sir as a part of the west i am inclined to oppose that theory doesnt always work out so well in practice but im also familiar with the corrupt individuals pushing globalism i do hope the best for you in though
socialism,removed,try it cunts we cant wait
socialism,removed,unbelievable they were supposed to start killing either twice as quickly or half as quickly but apparently neither happened im sending a letter to the manager and i suggest you do the same
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,this is stupid lenin stalin and trotsky all recognized the right of selfdetermination theres actually a difference between how the bourgeoisie and proletariat define right of selfdetermination its a right which means if certain violations are done that right is taken awaylike if one nation thinks they can oppress another you literally didnt read anything i said at all communists are not nationalists but internationalists and i clearly stated that there could be some instances where a nation may want to secede but principled unity should be encouraged china took over tibet when mao was chairman yes i dont think feudalistic monarchies have the right to exist that was a long time ago and conditions are quite different and china is different too and literally why do you think im in favor of everything stalin did this dumb assumption that you know my position on things because you think everyone has this mechanical stalinist politics needs to stop like national liberation adbocated by marxismleninism and marxismleninismmaoism are two totally different things but your sad metaphysical understanding of what you call marxism doesnt lead you to get that
socialism,removed,revisionist and an opportunist this man has nothing to do with marxism nor the proletarian revolution
socialism,removed,lol at everyone that is so quick to judge the lives of those in sri lanka from behind their smarthphonekeyboard
socialism,removed,she wore that slutty empowering panther gear and all of a sudden shes political and to be taken seriously and now this fuck her what a sick fucking media for thinking shes anything close to a panther and fuck her for perpetuating nonsense and being a blood sticking parasite
socialism,removed,it amazes me that people with no substantive knowledge of the underlying story are so willing to accept a construction of the story that comports with their personal ideology in this instance some people point to this tragedy as evidence of a failed medical system a byproduct of capitalism or even the result of our western system of hierarchy wanting to destroy the poorest and sickest members of society such big thoughts from such puny minds the folks are old they have medicare coverage if that woman was in such bad shape she could have found a doctor to treat her and prescribe meds in addition there is assistance for low income elderly people to help cover the out of pocket costs of copayments and medications further most elderly people have supplemental insurance to cover the costs that medicare does not pay if these people lacked the funds to buy this womans necessary medicine then they are in that position as a consequence of choices they made in the past most likely poor financial planning this goes to the heart of the matter a capitalist system depends on the individual taking personal responsibility for their welfare next what medicine exactly was this woman unable to afford that would have prevented her pain first the article does not say what her condition is there may be no way to stop her pain or otherwise mitigate her condition while the article is not clear i assume the husband is griping because he could not get strong pain medication such as opiates so he could keep the old lady in a stoned zombie state and thereby make it easier on him to take care of her whatever the case it is clear that these people failed to engage in proper financial planning so as to enable them to utilize the available options to cover their healthcare expenses as they aged whos fault is that it is also clear that this man murdered his wife though perhaps it may be better characterized as euthanasia if it is found to be the latter then i do empathize with the man however that still does not change the fact that they could have taken alternative actions in the past rather than just haphazardly hoping for the best therefore i am saddened by the tragic situation this man faced however perhaps more tragic is that the husband decided that he was entitled to being taken care of without having to invest any personal responsibility into either his or his wifes personal welfares that is the real tragedy here
socialism,removed,efficiency of planned economy，the idea that the workers wage is going to be lower and lower and the idea that socialism will happen in advanced capitalist country
socialism,removed,oh good idea to help things along hamas could place a few rocket launchers next to the statue even better they can chain some children to the rocket launchers and after israel bombs them they can parade the little bodies around while weeping loudly and posing for the cameras
socialism,removed,why
socialism,removed,and what are you going to do about locals who just want to live normally and who are against taking strangers to their communities their opinion doesnt matter
socialism,removed,so their wish to live normally is above wishes of locals thats how you get bloody conflicts
socialism,removed,they just have to pay for strangers and shut the fuck up thats what you want to say its locals who built the community and its their right to decide who will live with them and who wont not other way around there wont be any conflict if migrants wont show up and when locals lose to strangers its called occupation
socialism,removed,lol once again i hear that only migrants have rights and locals not socalled locals have to agree or fuck off why do they have to receive equal treatment as locals locals hardworked to built the community then some migrants show up and locals have to share their work with someone who never contributed to it if the locals are not ready to share their rights with others then neither should they receive their rights so its for you to decide who can and who cant receive rights you know they can disagree and prove their right not to share with weapons
socialism,removed,both migrants and locals have the right to move whenever and wherever they want the idea is for them to have equal rights locals cant tell migrants to fuck off and neither can migrants tell locals to fuck off in reality its onesided process locals dont want to move they are fine with what they have and want to live that way while mena people move to rich european countries building up tense locals always can tell migrants to fuck off they decide who will and who wont live on their land you missed the part where they will eventually be part of the local community helping to build up the community further without education and knowledge of language in reality they form parallel societies and bring tension if only those who contributes to it are allowed to join then shouldnt all newborns be kicked out as well they havent contributed also what about all internal migration someone from london that moves to edinburgh have never been part of the edinburgh community but they wouldnt be kicked out right newborn of locals grown up migrant nice parents have to pay for their children not all community or did i miss something while tax money of all community are used for migrants internal migration external migration in the context of a socialist society we are talking about real world not your ideal socialist society the idea is to help each other and share what they have with their own communitystatecommune and thus also migrants that moves there people pay taxes its their share if you will pay to migrant you will attract more and more of them then eventually you wouldnt be able to pay and will end up in bloody conflict if you believe this ideal should be fought against with violence i dont think you have any reason to be in this sub i can decide where to be without you if the locals are not ready to share their rights with others then neither should they receive their rights so its for you to decide who can and who cant receive rights you know they can disagree and prove their right not to share with weapons you want to take away rights from people who dont want live according to your ideals what other reaction do you expect
socialism,removed,so you ignore their opinion and then getting surprised why they vote for rightwing parties
socialism,removed,it appears we have different ideas on land you seeming to be a staunch supporter of all land being privately owned while most of us favor either no ownership of land or total communal ownership inside a state in either case its not their land to say fuck off about they dont live by your ideals so its their land to say fuck off about for more unplanned migrations aka the current refugee crisis in syria they dont much have the time this is where some pretty basic schooling comes into play if you want them to integrate and know the language provide ways for them to integrate and learn the language can be as simple as a weekend class with one teacher or so one more time locals dont want to integrate them locals dont want to pay for their centres food clothes courses and whatever locals dont want them at all taxes are also used to help infants and children as well school being the largest example in social democracies healthcare as well and even help with getting the proper nutrition through food assistance this is all through taxes this taxes are being payed by their parents and relatives too once again where our differing philosophies show we see the earth as just one commonality with little regard for the future prospects of the nationstate you seem to absolutely love the nationstate i love working things not utopian ones you seem to be assuming the new migrants will do nothing which forgets supply and demand and the fact that most people want to do something with the new demand a growing population brings there are new jobs as well as old ones either nobody wanted or that couldnt be filled the new migrants can fill those and be productive members of society like any regular person i dont assume i look on reality they came to improve their living standarts not to work and if you suddenly stop paying them they will revolt so thats why you have to pay and attract more and more eventually your money will run out oh but foreigners cant real world and internet are two different things
socialism,removed,people want to decide with whom they live xenophobic assholes lol no wonder left parties rapidly lose support
socialism,removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiwhiteflight its their right not to want foreigners
socialism,removed,black workers and white workers are still separated even though they have the same interests someone go tell the black lives matter people they need to get their shit straightened out
socialism,removed,vietnam has abandoned the revolution sadly ho chi minh would be disappointed why do the left support mass murderers like ho chi minh and vietnam communist party i really dont get it
socialism,removed,he is indeed like mass murderer mao maos had starve million people and massacred millions in the period from as a person who knows vietnam history i will say considering him as a mass murderer is not misunderstanding at all it is the inevitable conclusion after examining his action just as what one would conclude about assad or mao or present day korean regime
socialism,removed,the revolutionary ho chi minh collaborate with the french colonial regime and helped them to mass murder supporter and members of vietnam nationalist groups how revolutionary is that seriously this further proves the bolshveiks can do anything to advance their agenda thats why as an antiimperialist and a nationalist i always support anticolonial movement like hamas resistance in gaza and fretiline in east timor and fsa in syria as nonecommunist such movement would make life better while communist regime make life worse just look at post war vietnam as an example communism can not be anti authoritarian because as marx said the model of production determines the superior political structure
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,the neonazi label is an often misused one the national socialists didnt hate people of color and they had a lot of allies in north african and the middle east who knows maybe this guy doesnt hate blacks or maybe he can actually be professional and not let his personal views get in the way
socialism,removed,big words from a guy whose totalitarian regime cracked down on the working class
socialism,removed,also the usa is the leading country when it comes to foreign aid programs
socialism,removed,going to war with russia would be a horrible idea but i am still against this statement russia wants to be an imperialist nation that retakes all of its former lands they just dont think they can get away with it the world should be making statements and posing as if nato will unquestioningly be upheld simply so russia doesnt get the feeling that they can get away with an invasion
socialism,removed,because the soviet style of communism was all rainbows and sun shine how many people did stalin kill
socialism,removed,its not as if south africa is much better for all the help from what i read things are just as bad or worse than they had been only for a different group of people
socialism,removed,of course not just saying that nothing really improved all that much now a different group is in charge and a different group is being discriminated against its the same old song
socialism,removed,he banned me for showing him how stupid his argument was
socialism,removed,you can have absolutely have socialism while retaining a nation state and i think we should competition between nations is productive it sparks innovation which is necessary for economic growth the american state should act in the best interest of the american working class
socialism,removed,you should probably go to south africa that is where people like you belong
socialism,removed,fascist
socialism,removed,here is why any street brawl will end with a fascist victory unless outnumbered socialism attracts genetic garbage drug users failed middle or upper class kids nonwhites who fight when they are paid to or when provocative signage cause them to see red fascism attracts actual working men who fight for their convictions
socialism,removed,holy shit shes hot as fuck unbelievable someone would kill her
socialism,removed,boy reddit is racist
socialism,removed,stfu
socialism,removed,guyana has some land available
socialism,removed,wow im sure my dead mother still earning for capitalism after death while her past and future are wiped out after finding us slaves to commercial power and its cultish networks with the help of the socialists among others and her child stolen and killed off with the help of women in capitalism would have things to say at this one i really mean it women in my own life have been the idiots of capital the ideologists of what is essentially a lie called equality whose reality is a kind of slavery the state hags of capitalist state so assuredly its cooperative dirty workers and the prostitution of advert neocultures a subpolitical scam artist bigot or killer really and something of a disappointment to entirely heterosexual me still there are more important things in life than reproduction or needing people of which i disposed along with dead ideologies all that is solid melts into air all that is holy is profaned and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind that just appeared at the side of the page as i was writing about it brilliant shame about the one about faith in the future though less faith more thought far damn more truth would have gone a long way
socialism,removed,remember as in north korea and now in venezuela anticapitalist green party means free stuff unfortunately the only free stuff is the grass roots youll be eating on the upside the yards look immaculately trimmed the down side is there is no ranch dressing on the side on the up side again its mostly green
socialism,removed,maybe a similar reason to why there are nazi apologists
socialism,removed,feel i have to agree with one of the youtube comments on this one to say someone deserves felony assault for hurting your feelings is beyond retarded and sets a precedent that opens a pandoras box of fucked up shit i assume he had every legal right to stand there speaking into the megaphone and if not just call the cops reminds me of the westboro baptist church pickets and how they had children with them who got hit with trash thrown from passing vehicles not cool regardless how disgusting their hate speech is
socialism,removed,you sound like a year old just learning about socialism still got quite a bit of western misinformation to purge yourself of for one stalin or anyone in the ussr for that matter never called their country communist they werent retarded and equating statist socialist leaders to fascists really yeah were not all authoritarians and i lean more to the libertarian side of things as well but jesus
socialism,removed,he doesnt want to enforce sharia law nor do his followers assault women also they want to only temporarily stay in india and his followers dont cause problems nor even gain anything from the government the refugees in europe on the other hand
socialism,removed,you do realise that there are more muslims then in just the arab league and in europe they have a much higher birthrate then the native europeans right
socialism,removed,the guy is a huge asshole no doubt about that however i dont support this womans actions this was not the right way to deal with the situation
socialism,removed,you need to grow out of these century definitions communism socialism capitalism all these ideas and philosophies were founded by people had literally unlimited resources in their lifetimes its been years since then we dont live in that world anymore to use the same terms would be confusing conflagitory and miscommunicated you need to move onto sociocyberneering or a resource based economy completely separate yourself from the abusers of history using political words as power structures then people have to inquire about your movement because they have no frame of reference
socialism,removed,i say something that makes you challenge your way of thinking and then you brand me insert a so that my opinion doesnt matter according to you and i am speaking the truth his followers never caused any trouble in india and of all syrian refugees arent even syrian they are frauds who are allowed into europe in mass but i suppose you never heard about that since you only listen to certain sources maybe its time to grow up stop labelling people yourself and listen to critisism
socialism,removed,well from what i read most socialists in this subreddit dont really believe that muslimsarabsnorth africansrefugeeimmigrant populations commit more rapes or are more dangerous to women this sentiment seems to be dismissed as racism or nationalist propaganda however i will say for myself that since ive moved to europe from the us ive become more socially conservative in the sense that ive become more wary and disliking of certain immigrant populations i dont personally see a reason to welcome refugees insofar as it will create an unsustainable burden on the european welfare system lead to more unemployment and ethnic ghettos and fuel rightwing fascistic politics such that leftist parties will be out of power with the economic burden this creates the political parties in charge will definitely turn to austerity many leftists want to make it about identity politics and racism etc but i dont see positive social political and economic consequences from liberalizing ones borders emphasis on the liberalization leftists are taking up the cause of liberalism skeptics are dismissed as racists and the capitalists get cheap labor and the political and economic rationality to pursue austerity
socialism,removed,maybe i care about human beings as well but i dont close myself off to reality when it comes knocking on my door like it or not by not being willing to make the tough decisions you will saddle future generations with the problems you helped create by doing that you show that you dont really care about human beings since youre just interested about making yourself feel good about yourself regardless who suffers because of the consequenses off your or lack off actions
socialism,removed,werent the fascists known to kill anyone who disagreed with their political views and try to force said political viewpoints onto others seems to me that youre the fascist here friend though in order to realise that youd first have to know the meaning of the word let me ask you something if you have to restort to insults because you cant win a argument with someone with a different opinion then your own perhaps its time to reconsider your stance on things
socialism,removed,well if you have heard it many times before perhaps they are on to something and you are basing the accusation on me disagreeing with you where im basing it on your actions and thin skin when it comes to critisism perhaps food for thought
socialism,removed,did he rape them no to quote chomsky if you believe in freedom of speech you believe in freedom of speech for views you dont like even goebbels was in favour of freedom of speech for views he liked so was stalin youre in favour of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise otherwise youre not in favour of freedom of speech theres two positions you can have on freedom of speech you can decide which position you want
socialism,removed,poisoned bananas
socialism,removed,cannot consent to what they are protesting what are you talking about
socialism,removed,not all revolutionaries need to behave like violent and mindless thugs
socialism,removed,holy fuck what is this video all i see is a bunch of bullshit scarecrows he builds and then knocks down he sounds incredibly insecure about having been called all of these terms hes whining about hes not addressing any philosophical points but rambling about dumb shit strangers are saying on the internet about him yes virtue signaling is a term that can be applied very broadly and thus easily misused but this video does nothing to address proper uses of the term and why virtue signaling is bad for that i recommend as it shows examples of virtue signaling in modern society and how it fits into a much larger picture
socialism,removed,doesnt he know that hiv already exists
socialism,removed,satire is a great medium for political commentary but more specifically that video i linked provides a much more nuanced approach to the points brought up in south park he doesnt rehash the points of the show but he provides further analysis which makes the video worth watching even if youre not interested in south park
socialism,removed,so its feeding the trolls trolls are gonna troll falling into their trap doesnt make a useful video
socialism,removed,also addressed in the linked video where parker and stone selfreference themselves as two privileged white boys the status quo isnt fine but regressive leftists are so busy fighting for social justice that theyre ignoring the more widespread economic issues that are plaguing our country almost like movements like in an conspiracylike attempt to distract from more serious issues
socialism,removed,are the most revolutionary elements of the working class what brought you to this conclusion
socialism,removed,subjecting yourself to authority even when that authority is genuinely democratic haha fuck democracy you wouldnt even support an anarchist trade union that conforms to consensus decision making and all that other shit anarchists like yea anarchocommunistssyndicalists are the ones that like that theyre mostly edgy teenagers have a strategy by which to achieve communism look up union of egoists if you have a sectarian and ultraleft stance on the trade unions then how can you possibly hope to build the class conciousness amongst workers that will be necessary to get rid of capitalism lol goo buzzterms by the way you know this isnt a religion right you dont go in the streets handing out communist pamphlets talk to your friends or something if people are interested in socialism due to the failures of capitalism they have the resources people will only learn if willing
socialism,removed,damn really got me there guess we should just toss out that essential and super useful right for a cool meme
socialism,removed,reddit activism is srs bsns
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,honestly when shit hits the fan i frankly have more trust in working class conservatives than the limo liberals says the redditor as he rants on the shitter in one of the whitest parts of america about the limousine liberals ie minorities or women or intellectuals who are suffering because of working class shitheads like him electing people like reagan bush and now trump youre just a socialist of the national variety enjoy that factory job until limousine liberals will automate it and make you obsolete
socialism,removed,if theyre liberals they can go fuck themselves why do these even matter of course they dont the only people that matter are the uneducated white factory workers and rednecks like you who jerk off to authoritarian strongmen and hate civil rights with a passion
socialism,removed,so let me understand this the people who are literally voting against their own interests are more reasonable than the ones who didnt the working class conservative who listens to nothing but rightwing radio and is more outspoken and has more conviction is less dogmatic than the liberals who listen to the mainstream press and who can be much more easily swayed by new information and facts and arguments gotta love brocialists trying to come to terms with the facts that theyd rather be at trump rallies beating up protesters than trying to pretend they care about social and economic equality
socialism,removed,yeah i wish i was cool like you jerking off to totalitarian slavobalkanic dictators like tito and ceausescu instead
socialism,removed,america is totally an imperialist country guise but dont you dare question my favorite glorious leader who ruled a country without any opposition for decades no wonder commeitards hate liberals so much they ask too many uncomfortable questions care about too many liberties and dont fall in line with fringe historical revisionism
socialism,removed,the guy who uses liberal as an insult talks about smugness and condescension would tip fedora again
socialism,removed,sorry comrade i get extra trashcany when i see reactionary lefties showing their true colors and admitting theyd rather buddyup with fascists than with liberals
socialism,removed,the average rural conservative in ma httpwwwnytimescomelectionsresultsmassachusetts in the primary and blames their wrongdoings on those sissy liberals who have ruined everything im glad you share their tactic of being offended at others not accepting their offensive behavior how deplorable of you
socialism,removed,america has the most foreign military bases of any nation on earth in places where they are not wanted or needed we invade sovereign nations sometimes under the guise of good reasons toppling saddam and sometimes for bad ones fighting the viet cong but almost always to support the bourgeoisie in some way whether its oil supply or fighting a regime which seeks to strip the rich of their power yeah i know foreign military and political intervention is cool only when russians and the chinese do it americans should stop defending their own allies and should let those sovereign nations ruled by genocidal maniacs mind their own business invading kuwait and notoriously violating the human rights of the citizens theyre supposed to serve also lets make sure we put in power again the party who did the fullscale invasion of iraq and whose nominee wants to steal their oil as spoils of war over the party that is trying to mend diplomatic relations with iran cuba and so on do you understand anything about yugoslavia its generally regarded as one of the best examples of a communist nation and it was titos death which lead to the ethnic split of yugoslavia and the eventual wars and genocides which took place during the collapse being the least worst experimental failure is not particularly impressive still a oneparty regime ruled by one dictator for decades followed by massive amounts of political prisoners and suppression of dissidents religious people and intellectuals who disagreed with him and brainwashing his citizens into venerating his cult of personality he was even best friends with ceausescu who was certainly one of the worst of his kind around that area
socialism,removed,hello fellow oklahoman comrade it certainly isnt easy here are you in a a more dense area or in the middle of nowhere i live in guthrie just minutes from okc so i see the conservative lib tards more than i see socdecs and such most of my friends are though
socialism,removed,the dumb groid was armed in a school zone criminal american
socialism,removed,it was a brick and he was concussed and unconscious immediately the dumb groid was armed in a school zone criminal american
socialism,removed,i just saw this on cnn terrible it seems as though he had exited his car with a gun not sure why this article didnt mention it
socialism,removed,kill him and his racist white ass for the sake of progress
socialism,removed,im sorry but why is the trump supporter represented as a white supremest
socialism,removed,but all racists are trump supporters i disagree completely there are many racists among the hillary supporters your world view needs to be widened
socialism,removed,workers are too dumb to run the means of production
socialism,removed,you arent listening with an open mind and because of that you are not reaching the other side you certainly seem unaware that the fear of clinton is the same as your fear of trump it was democrats that didnt vote that made clinton loose
socialism,removed,many trump supporters would say that he is not racist and instead that is a falsehood spread by the mainstream media and the hillary campaign his quotes taken out of context or jumping to conclusions based on certain innocent remarks when shown in a different light look really bad both candidates were very dirty and had questionable aspects of their character that were brought to light by their competitors hillarys superpredator and trumps mexican judge are just one example
socialism,removed,these racists dont seem like theyre supporting trump
socialism,removed,be honest you think only white people can be racist
socialism,removed,i read love canal and hookers and thought this was gonna be something slightly different
socialism,removed,did you try the first result of the most obvious youtube search here you go
socialism,removed,who draws mustaches like that who draws like that in general
socialism,removed,rthebrigadiers is here
socialism,removed,everyone you dumb fuck
socialism,removed,are you talking about illegal immigrants taking white blue collar jobs
socialism,removed,i think it is pretty unfair to make the trump a white supremacist sure the kkk probably voted for him but that isnt everyone damn this is why he won
socialism,removed,there are at most klansmen ya jerkasses you are not helping you did not help during the election and you are not helping now wake up
socialism,removed,i feel like this is pretty relevant if there is ever a fascist takeover in america it will come not in the form of storm troopers kicking down doors but with lawyers and social workers saying im from the government and im here to help liberal fascism the secret history of the american left from mussolini to the politics of meaning by jonah goldberg
socialism,removed,seriously keep talking to them while they stick their fingers in their ears and shout hillary for prison i think you need to come up with a new tactic
socialism,removed,this ship has already sailed the left in this country screamed racism for years my political life starting in was filled with nothing but rancor from the left there was a time when i was in college in where a graphic design student showed her photoshops of bush jr in a nazi uniform on election night in i went downstairs where some students were watching the election results and i was asked if i voted for bush when i said yes several people that lived in my dorm screamed at me to leave so i have personally experienced this and that more than anything made me recoil from the left then it went to with barack obama and actual seated democrats so called left wing people that are supposed to represent all sorts of people calling me a racist because i disagreed with obamas policies on a side note stuff like this is why i voted for trump i didnt care about the policies so much which was a first i cared that the left was not just disagreeing with people politically but actively trying to destroy peoples moral character they deny their humanity with these kinds of images ps there are only kkk members in the us it aint the anymore
socialism,removed,fuck you im not a klansman for voting trump
socialism,removed,thats what america did for the elections they did the right thing by electin president trump the best thing that happen for socialism since ever
socialism,removed,im so tired of this white privilege nonsense and its what led to trump in the first place if you are white you arent automatically privileged or racist
socialism,removed,make the left more than about taking orders from obnoxious black women and whites will come back
socialism,removed,fuck your bullshit
socialism,removed,trump is gonna get rid of the illegals and make union labor even better tho
socialism,removed,wow you fucking idiots are still around like million deaths werent quite enough
socialism,removed,tldr fukin hwite mails
socialism,removed,say that to all the folks living in white trash trailer parks wheres their white privilege does privilege exist of course is does but to assume that its entirely based on skin color is ridiculous and people are tired of hearing these facts you know what actually contributes to privilege more than anything else class wealth household stability things that people who parrot this white privilege bullshit dont like to talk about because it largely includes them which would them the bad guys in their mind and makes their actions completely unjustified this is why people lose their shit when for example people think its somehow okay for a university degree program to take a smart young wealthy black student or a woman or anyone who isnt a straight white male and convince them that theyre being oppressed by society at every corner and encourage them to speak out against the privileges of white people who may very well be worse off in life than themselves and yet any opposition to such actions is immediately dismissed as racism or sexism or whatever else people reject what you know as fact because they reject your collectivist thinking that leads you to assume that everyone of specific skin colors are treated the same way think the same way and thus holds people to different standards based on these uncontrollable characteristics this is rejected in favor of an individualist style of thinking that treats and judges people based on things like their individual character actions and morals as it is always better to treat one for the factors that they are in control of rather than birth given factors that they are not and that goes for any race or gender you didnt think it would be necessary to explain here because theres a difference between socialism and your brand of social marxism and the progressive stack of oppression that you dont seem to be able to distinguish
socialism,removed,not sure but hes getting rid of illegals 👍 eyes on the prize comrade eyes in the prize
socialism,removed,dont make the same mistakes hillary did in her campaign and ignore demographics i drive a forklift loading and unloading trucks for hours a week almost all of my coworkers votes trump at least you cant look at the largest online community for donald trump and think of it are a fringe demographic like upperclass white republican males youre marginalizing trump supporters with these statements and literally doing what this picture is saying not to you dont deserve the up votes you have right now because youre the problem
socialism,removed,start talking whereas just pulling the racismsexismmisogynyhomophobia text module as killer argument shouldnt be considered talking its about these thoughtterminating cliché chains these rules that have to be considered when expressing an opinion in order not to commit the crime of saying something wrong these strange automatisms that happen when for example someone who critisises excesses of feminism is automatically also a nazi suddenly where people who want less refugees for some reason immediately are also blamed to suppress lesbians and gays and to beat disabled persons if every word is put on a gold scale you effectively issue bans on speaking and make it impossible to address problems and injustices thats not talking thats prohibiting discussions
socialism,removed,ship them back
socialism,removed,an incredibly naive viewpoint to classify your average trump supporter as a kkk member i guess it coincides with the subreddit at hand enjoy losing future elections
socialism,removed,hahaha when you cant answer the opposition just scream muh brigade and delete them what a bunch of pussies you are have fun in your safe space
socialism,removed,so we are just lumping all trump supporters into the kkk basket
socialism,removed,ill respond to the post you linked here because it seems like a better place one thing i didnt get from your post is who or what you blame for your job being outsourced in order to solve the problem we first have to make sure were clear on what and who the problem is and what causes it
socialism,removed,back to native country should chip them like dogs and have harsh punishments if they get back over
socialism,removed,i think even the left has reason to be cautious about screening immigrants in our contemporary world youd have to be mindless to let everyone from a war zone in
socialism,removed,most black people will never experience a lot of the stuff you listed just like white people furthermore issues being more common isnt the same as them being unique to certain groups and it shouldnt be treated that way which is something you do multiple times otherwise we could start calling murder rape violence or crime in general black aggression because they are more commonly committed by black people than they are by whites white privilege doesnt mean you are a bad person it doesnt even mean you are positively privileged it means you are not additionally disadvantaged so universities have not been discriminating against white people for a long time there might not be as much of an implicit bias in academia because the majority of people are white and are more commonly biased against black people but the open bias against white people in academia is stronger than ever if people considered the whole picture and start talking about black privilege the type of stuff that makes them commit suicide at much lower rates gets them into college and hired for certain jobs with lower qualifications allows them greater freedom to express their thoughts and opinions in many settings then id consider the concept of white privilege to be useful as sensible right now its most commonly used by people who want to exaggerate how good life is for whites because that fulfills some fucked up craze they have
socialism,removed,beautiful it gets really hard speaking to people from all different walks of life and having them tell me to my face that im crazy that im trying to hand america over to russia this from a black man who has been incarcerated multiple times has six credit cards in his wallet im sure some amount of debt like we all do has been forced to buy a new car in order to build his credit for the right to buy a house im smart he tells me i work in it i piss money i see slavery i am a white man in a different strata of slavery but this is slavery plain and simple there is no upward mobility for either of us he may play this game and get that house but what he doesnt see is that they piss houses thank you for posting this op it is revitalizing to know im not crazy or alone with what are blatant truths at this point can someone explain the references to egypt for me please
socialism,removed,just stick to the academic subreddits or the smaller ones where people are more sane thats what i do
socialism,removed,i am blocked from lsc so cant say anything about the vetements piece there a walmart flannel wont be the same quality and certainly wont look as good if worn right this will look very nice too why are yall so negative over there anyway complaining and complaining about the west but if u look anywhere else u will see we have it way better also that playmobile post was just ridicoulous it is just a fucking cop little kids wanna be police officers when they grow up so why cant they play with police toys

socialism,removed,fit of rage i dont think you get my sense of humor
socialism,removed,not a socialist in fact a trump supporters but that sub needed to die i believe there is always room for well thought out discourse and lively fact based debate in our lives and indeed without own very own views being challenged how would we ever hope to grow as individuals but make no mistake that sub was a cancer they are everything rational people should stand against and its about damn time sorry for hopping in here on your thread im just super pumped

socialism,removed,wheres that little weird guy from vermont hes always anxious to make everyone equally poor and unhappy it worked wonders for the ussr did he run off to cuba or some other country full of oppressed people
socialism,removed,why does this sub have so much hate for the alt right most of them were socialists too
socialism,removed,silencing free speech is fascism
socialism,removed,censorship of different ideas continues
socialism,removed,the good ol your ideology killed more people than mine argument i can understand why you guys are happy about the alt right losing their sub so am i but to have this subtext as if socialism is sworn to destroy bigotry is laughable
socialism,removed,congrats rsocialism you guys are one step closer to achieving absolutely nothing i sincerely hope seeing donald trumps beautiful mug on the tv every day reminds you that you have literally done nothing to help anything and anyone in your miserable existence the screen youre looking at this comment on so angrily was built by capitalism your life is hypocrisy get a job
socialism,removed,shut it commies

socialism,removed,hooray censorship fucking hypocrites
socialism,removed,censorship
socialism,removed,this unfortunately is what many of you comrades fail to understand about american ideology we champion freedom above all else especially freedom of speech this presents great difficulty as it allows our very enemies who would seek to destroy our way of life a voice of their own this includes nazis marxists jihadists etc we can differ in economics but when people like you preach censorship of the very principles our country is founded on merely because you disagree with othersno matter how vile their rhetoric isyou not only make it more difficult on yourself and your ideology but you show your very disdain for our country which gives you that free voice nazis want americans to purge the cultural marxists and their subversive tactics marxists want americans to purge the nazis and their white supremacy what you seem to not grasp is that patriotic americans hate both of these groups patriotism is growing rapidly in this country because of foolhardy people like you we have a saying here in america that is taught in all our schools it goes like this i know not what others may choose but as for me give me liberty or give me death we americans amongst all our differences would rather be at war fighting for our very freedoms then to be slaves to a system that doesnt allow us a free voice or free press simply because theyve deemed themselves the curators of whats acceptable i laugh when i see you with joy at the silence of your opposition for i know good well curses are like chickens they always come home to roost
socialism,removed,please ban me socialism is cancer
socialism,removed,reddit
socialism,removed,no more socialism
socialism,removed,can someone please fucking explain to me what is wrong with people why do people see themselves as white people instead of just human beings white black asian or hispanic we are all members of the same fucking species and we should fucking act like it
socialism,removed,neither are socialists
socialism,removed,i strap all my leftists to the chairs personally
socialism,removed,i dont see why african american history in order to graduate
socialism,removed,sorry comrades but socialism is still just a meme ideology
socialism,removed,guess who gets to rule the country oh wait does bernie still have a chance bahaha
socialism,removed,yay freedom of speech is dead
socialism,removed,is you
socialism,removed,this sub 😂
socialism,removed,you know what the definition of a bigot is a person that is intolerant of people holding different opinions and fascists are usually the first ones to try and silence those with different beliefs congratulations you gave milo exactly what he wanted now instead of speaking in front of less than people he is getting airtime on networks with viewers
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,neckbeards unironically calling each other comrade posting from their macbooks and iphones sign me up just donated my neighbors dog to bernie
socialism,removed,youre just objectively wrong fascism is about an authoritarian usually a dictatorship nationalistic government while there is extreme racism that spawns of fascism it isnt a necessary tenant of the ideology as in one could be fascist without being racist depending on what they want their nation to look like there is no core principle of fascism that dictates that whites and straight people are superior if your national identity was a queer person of color then the fascist government would support queer people of color im always for an open debate as ideologies move forward could you imagine if people used the same logic with socialism socialism is not to be tolerated it is not to be debated it is not to be considered it is to be destroyed with impunity in order to protect capitalist people from violence seventy years ago we didnt just punch soviets when they showed their ugly faces in public we put bullets in their heads or did you forget that the cold war was a thing
socialism,removed,durrrrrr burning the things of the city that the person in disagree with is speaking in is a great way to show our peacefully was regardless of whether the man owns it or not those protesters have a right to make the taxpayer buy another burning things is the best way to stand up for yourself im so smart upostpunkcub
socialism,removed,weak antifa pussies the day hasnt come yet
socialism,removed,comrades
socialism,removed,kikes are more effective than i initially assumed
socialism,removed,milo never argued for genocide i absolutely agree richard spencer is essentially the devil incarnate im arguing that by simply trying to silence them your allowing them to recruit more than if you simply proved them wrong i would never sit on my hands and let people die from any sort of tyranny bet it from the right or the left and on the last thing i suppose i could have been more clear im trying to refer to the period in which stalin was in power i couldnt think of a shorthanded term for it off the top of my head you know million starved to death almost twice what hitler did
socialism,removed,i dont know what youre trying to brigade other leftleaning subs
socialism,removed,socialism will be the downfall of man
socialism,removed,it is something that arose from socialism no
socialism,removed,i dont know what youre trying to talk about socialism respectfully
socialism,removed,please ban me from your cancerous ideology worship that has killed hundreds of millions thank you and go fuck yourselves
socialism,removed,but also fuck socialism that is all
socialism,removed,im not trying to roast you the way it was written made it sound like you were steamrolled it doesnt make you a bad person just not a fashbasher yknow
socialism,removed,say what you want about them but atleast they wont get on someones ass for drawing catgirls
socialism,removed,bigotry ableism and hate speech will be met with immediate bans socialism is an intrinsically inclusive system and we believe all people are born equal and deserve equal voices in society a contradiction in itself
socialism,removed,lol america is fucked this is hilarious to watch from afar youre as mental as the other side
socialism,removed,haha liberals are sad about free speech lel
socialism,removed,i did sit around no one was being killed no one was being bodily harmed if they had killed a person i would protest as well also hundreds of refugees not millions were legally detained while i disagree with president trump on this issue its only temporary also you tried to assert that you had the moral high ground by bringing up the nazis i then went to stalin and you now try to make it seem like i was being offensive about that issue as opposed to being defensive
socialism,removed,he just did on fox news like i said instead of speaking to people hes speaking to
socialism,removed,nothing says tolerance like stripping a gay jew of his freedom of speech
socialism,removed,if you dont like him ignore him it is never appropriate to meet words with violence
socialism,removed,this is what destroying a community looks like you are causing more fear in a fearful time and giving milo a platform to reach not only those students but the rest of the country via media coverage not to mention the students involved will more than likely be arrested and those that are not will have to wake up tomorrow and deal with a campus that they themselves destroyed
socialism,removed,the only danger is the protesters and you should tolerate him the same reason anybody should tolerate anyone who is different than you
socialism,removed,yea better ban opinions we dont likeoh wait isnt this what facism is about lel
socialism,removed,dont forget using pepper spray on people who are doing interviews and beating other random people until they are unconscious
socialism,removed,bash the fash they are working class cuckolds
socialism,removed,this sub is next
socialism,removed,yeah but its all over the news though we need to kill everyone at fox news and every straight white male to stop this
socialism,removed,thats the spirit fight perceived fascism with actual fascism
socialism,removed,high energy nsfpedes
socialism,removed,communists killed way more people than the nazis ever did so using your logic we should go after you guys on this sub go after anyone who is a socialist or communist with the vigor that you want to go after supposed fascists milo never argues for extermination of anyone you are literally arguing for violence right now you are worse than him for sure even if you disagree with him you advocate violence and he does not
socialism,removed,but guys if we ban people doesnt that make us the real nazis
socialism,removed,bunch of snowflakes that cant take a dissenting opinion or rather two thousand and of course some well placed fists
socialism,removed,censorship is wrong
socialism,removed,anarchists are the opposite of socialists you know that right
socialism,removed,when socialists cheer as peoples voices are suppressed you realize people are living in a backwards ass world
socialism,removed,never change you guys are a blessing
socialism,removed,what about the people getting beaten with sticks while lying motionless on the ground what about the girl who got pepper sprayed midinterview do they not have human rights or are they just property as well
socialism,removed,how the utter fuck do you think this is ok or how about this
socialism,removed,we stopped his speech at ucb victory comrades what you fucking idiots dont realize is that instead of speaking to a few hundred people he got to go on fox and speak to millions about the riotous borderline terroristic behavior that took place tonight tomorrow people will be hearing about how violent it was and how much damage was done its hilarious since you all seem to love creating a platform for fascists when i thought the opposite was true congratulations the left in this country continues to play themselves
socialism,removed,scenario he speaks a few hundred people hear what he has to say his existing youtube audio is able to listen no drama everyone forgets about it eventually like it never happened did not happen scenario rioters smash fascism and forcibly no platform him he gets national coverage his message is heard by millions on broadcast television he trends on social media his online audience grows by thousands within a few hours everyone remembers the violence of that antifa everyone remembers the no platforming tensions grow hate happened who are the leaders comparable to milo who could debate his ideas thats what needs to happen to sway public opinion away from him to destroy him everything thats happening instead is only making him more popular and making those whose private property is damaged in the rioting turn away from your ideas even more the more this happens the more people tune into him because they want to see whats so bad that riots are needed to protest whats the shame about uw that you couldnt make him even more famous
socialism,removed,lol youre all gonna get helicopter rides
socialism,removed,id sock milo so hard hed stay plastered
socialism,removed,um have you seen the video of them smashing in someones head this aint russia that shit is not okay
socialism,removed,there is actually one of milos main arguments against the left is that they are against free speech and violent hes most likely thrilled something like this has happened as it just makes his narrative seem true
socialism,removed,just try to remember that in all of this the anarchists are no friends of the socialists or anyone else for that matter wanting a way out of the crumbling democracy of america or the neoliberal economic policies that are poisoning it and other countries theyre animals shitting wherever they are sometimes that falls on the bad guys but its just as likely to soil the people that need help
socialism,removed,if you are afraid of brainwashing then you should be pushing for greater critical thinking skills in education and not no platforming people need to be exposed to all kinds of ideas as a part of their education normalizing political violence in order to terrorize universities to not even considering certain speakers will only make those speakers more powerful especially when people investigate those speakers on their own and find out that they were misled you are not accomplishing what you wish to happen the youth are inherently rebellious curious and if they hear something is being repressed they will investigate it at its source which has happened and continues to happen fox news is having a surging of young people they are getting better ratings than the daily show so many events are compounding together to make this happen and its only getting crazier by the day what would be better is public debates where arguments and ideas go against each other with people encouraged to participate in open discussion about the ideas not name calling or trying to shut him up because when people hear you call him the worst possible names when they hear that he has been violently rioted against they will go to him and listen because of humanitys morbid fascination for horror then they find things about him which make them think wtf hes homosexual his maternal grandmother is jewish which by halacha makes his mother jewish and therefore he is jewish why are people calling him a nazi these two wtfs alone really make people give milo a chance then more wtfs come and people lose trust in the people who called him the worst possible names they grow suspect of the people rioting against him by resorting to political violence you are only making more people openly accepting toward contrary ideas with less exposure to your ideas
socialism,removed,greenhouse gasses dont dig graves
socialism,removed,the best option is forcing universities not to give him a chance in the first places everybody in america has a right to speak it is a right people literally died for and its a right i am goddamn proud of
socialism,removed,i cant believe what im hearing the property damage was to theschool which had nothing to do with the event other than endorsing it because of a belief in free speech and businesses which just happened to be on or near campuses i work at a place not far from a campus if i lose my job because it was broken into and wrecked because of a political retaliation to a speech i wasnt involved in or endorsed i doubt that id see that as wow this really makes me feel equal and a part of my community not to mention people were injured and maimed putting aside obvious risk of death its a pretty traumatic experience to be dragged to the ground and beaten with a bike lock or maced in the face just for standing up for what you believe in but most importantly youre endorsing violence as a viable political tactic and once you open that door when can we stop focusing on property and start hurting people if someones fascist enough or we disagree with him enough does that justify a murder or at the very least a serious assault with a hospitalization and if everyones equal can other people silence your views through either the threat of violence or actual violence can i break into your house throw your possessions to the ground take all the money you have and say hey sorry nothing personal i just disagree with you politically if you wont see my position and its logic hopefully you wont express your opinions again because ill break or steal your property absolutely absurd and hurts your movement to express views like that
socialism,removed,yeah you guys are totally not fascists at all i mean your tactics are completely different than those the nazi sa used
socialism,removed,sips starbucks and types on his macbook wise words there comrade none better spoken
socialism,removed,remember fascism is always a counterreaction just look at nazigermany where fascism rose as a counterreaction to an attempt at a soviet communist coup now fascism is rising in america because of you you anarchists communists who destroy burn ridicule others who have other opinions then you you are giving them an excuse to impose fascism which they see as a last defense strategy stop trying to infiltrate subversive ideology in american society stop going around destroying things you are legitimizing a counter reaction its like you want a civil war you dont want it cause you will be eradicated the military the police the militias the fast majority of gun owners they would all side with what you call fascists stop trying to bait them into becoming one for your own little confirmation bias and you stop this country from descending into a civil war for christ sake you people are evil always have been
socialism,removed,theres a reason its freedom of speech and not freedom for people to say things i agree with you dont kill a bad argument by preventing people from saying it or hearing it you allow it to destroy itself if you fear that the idea will spread and propagate itself that people will adopt it you lend it credence as a viable political idea also do you know what is rather authoritarian speaking of fascism violently assaulting innocent people and destroying private property because people are expressing political views you dont agree with
socialism,removed,are you siding with a riot
socialism,removed,you all are fucking nuts
socialism,removed,oh yeah and trump will win this confirmation too another win on my side keep burning berkeley another win for my side i am on a hot streak
socialism,removed,advocating ethnic cleansing is a threat yes if there is the ability to act on the threat then its assault that wouldnt be considered protected speech
socialism,removed,lol you are a twit
socialism,removed,apparently people were murdered i no longer support this protest as a resident of berkeley this is not a protest at all
socialism,removed,so you are suggesting using force to suppress the free exchange of ideas ask yourself instead why there are no voices from the left to compare to a milo or ben shapiro your standard bearers are lena dunham and caitlyn jenner
socialism,removed,protestors those were terrorists and many of them should have been shot
socialism,removed,you realize it was called the cold war because it never escalated to actual conflict between the soviets and the americans right you are aware of that muffin yeah maybe go read a history book pumpkin oh did you forget the proxy wars in north korea and vietnam the us didnt have to have a direct conflict w the ussr bc communism destroyed itself and became a lost causebut it killed over ppl on that path to destroying itself also the us entering into wwii wasnt to fight fascism thats the excuse ppl use to give it meaning it was all geopolitics and protecting us interests
socialism,removed,i came to this sub cause i was told you were celebrating this event i wanted to see if it was true i cannot comprehend of a rational comunity where downvoting this coment could be expected
socialism,removed,millions of refugees and muslims were illegally detained without due process in airports all around the country this last weekend out of actually
socialism,removed,shame youre getting down voted plenty of examples of unprovoked assault on video left will go down a dark path if it starts justifying violence against people by calling everyone it doesnt like fascist i live in berkeley and plenty of local shops were damaged shops owned by working class immigrant families no less like the good people at sams market bunch of angry children with no real philosophy other than rage
socialism,removed,people were savagely beaten on a number of occasions by this crowd
socialism,removed,that is not the literal definition of fascism dip shit
socialism,removed,that is already an issue with having these speakers at unis the protection from you thugs is too expensive
socialism,removed,millions lol you just say whatever pops into your head dont you
socialism,removed,socialism doesnt work
socialism,removed,he is the bill cosby i dont know why you would say this with current public knowledge of cosby unless you mean he drugged and raped people i will just repeat what he said once i would cure my homosexuality if i ever could but i know hes doing this to appeal to the far right kid i remember listening to that joe rogan podcast and i cant remember the context id bet he was speaking sarcastically but here are two of the podcasts he was on rogans show people can listen and make up their own minds about whatever he exactly said heres another video where milo talks about this with some more specific context without trying to find it in the longer podcasts httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqwwtavkave he says that the reason he wishes he was not homosexual is that he wishes he could create a child with the person he loves while he was loving them this seems to not be an uncommon sentiment with homosexual people hes just narcisistic he does love himself and everything about him unapologetically that is for sure hes also anti feminist hes antisomekinds of feminism not all of them he supports equity feminism for example he doesnt support the kind of feminism which thinks all of the problems in the world are due to cis het white males anti trans he is against transtrenders who appropriate being trans as a lifestyle he is sympathetic to people with genuine gender dysphoria trans people can and will be harrassed everywhere he goes are you talking about being disagreed with or genuine legal harassment why are the trans people who are supporters of his not being harassed just for being trans i happen to know a few and they are accepted with no issue those who agree and disagree with him are there any cases where milo supporters harassed trans people wherever he went can you see the absurdity that anywhere milo goes he and his supporters are harassed assaulted with video evidence in abundance a part of his viewers are altirighters they are the ones who must be silenced no they must be challenged their ideas must be brought to the sunlight and not approached dishonestly because people hate being lied to and that only creates more of them their arguments must be pushed back with better arguments people are celebrating for the raltright subreddit being banned just recently this does nothing to actually defeat them or their ideas my ideals are not centered about political violence we must do it peacefully we can see the writing on the wall if situations are not deescalated the truth is the most radical of the right desperately want escalation they want the government the west to fail too they want a get out of jail free card when they shoot an antifa in the face in self defense for assaulting them violence is exactly what they want why arent you on the police subreddit telling cops to stop beating and murdering people in the street and inside prisons where are the police subreddits where cops a celebrating beating and murdering people in the streets and inside prisons good cops hate bad cops too and even these situations can be resolved peacefully end the war on drugs decriminalize drug use decriminalize drugs focus on supporting rehabilitation these can all be done peacefully within our system of government so many police confrontations no longer have to happen so much criminal activity can be defunded so many people will no longer be sent to prison
socialism,removed,this sub appears to retain an average iq of room temperature my word how your parents must be humiliated by the puerile and halfbaked intellectualism youre fostering
socialism,removed,do you fail to see that denying somebody a platform to speak is one of the cornerstones of fascism and authoritarianism
socialism,removed,can you please identify the human rights which these people were advocating for and how they achieved this by damaging property
socialism,removed,can you explain why youd break the windows if as you suggest they are so inconsequential whilst your at it why dont you take a moment to reflect on the people who were physically assaulted and suffered serious bodily harm so that these children could throw their toys around ingrate
socialism,removed,what fight is that
socialism,removed,in selfdefence
socialism,removed,you ought to be sent to a gulag in the early and be educated on what real communism looks like and how real fascism works you impudent toad
socialism,removed,get the hell out of here this sub is an odious fissure of backwardthinking resentful intellectuallyidle teens who havent spent so much as half an hour exploring history
socialism,removed,you liberal socialists deserve the working class lives you live enjoy earning money for the important people
socialism,removed,there is and will never be anything good about violence that simply isnt true but i commend you at least for trying to calm the barbaric chimps in this sub
socialism,removed,accidentally deleted when editing typo only an apologist would call trolling education as for trolling i dislike intentionally making people feel bad but i also dislike selfcensoring yourself in order to never hurt anyones feelings which is what milo actually talks about school is the kind of place where you should be exposed to things which could potentially hurt your feelings it shouldnt be a space where you never feel bad milo is also a comedian and trolling people making fun of their ideas has a long tradition in comedy if that truly has no place in education then there is a lot that has to go get that ridiculous notion out of your head that was never in my head to begin with what is actually in my head is that people need to be exposed to true bigotry they need to see what consequential horrors come from hate they need to be exposed to actual suffering we need to know history to not repeat the mistakes of the people who came before us challenging ideas should not be hid from the youth they need to grow up as adults and be able to work within the world with a brutal understanding of reality bigotry hate trolling education here is a problematic example in action you list these things out without attacking his ideas directly because of people doing this kind of thing these words are losing their bite you should be able to list specific things hes said and done they should be self evident that they are bigotry hate and so on people go to protest milo without knowing anything hes actually said they go to protest based on the keywords not the actual content that they know about people should knot exactly what milo said not go and protest just because they were told he is a nazi sexist racist etc etc etc without ever being exposed to his arguments and better arguments fascist the issue here is that him being called a nazi makes people double take when they learn hes gay and jewish which has the unintended consequence of making people more likely to listen to him do you understand
socialism,removed,heaven forbid everyone has the right to speak socialists communists anarchists conservatives republicans democrats and liberals you must celebrate someone was denied their planned organized speech thanks to people rioting and destroying businesses in the area
socialism,removed,unofascistusa s account is days old funnily enough around days ago david brock was funded more for his online shilling operations programme isnt that a coincidence
socialism,removed,what the fuck is this subreddit
socialism,removed,yes there is he is still very much an internet figure this just gives him increased exposure to the mainstream media he had a minute segment on fox which introduces him to an older demographic who are more likely to agree with him i wouldnt be suprised if he pays people to get these riots started
socialism,removed,never heard that in my life from milo do you have a source of him saying that
socialism,removed,that is unacceptable but there are socialists who are wiling to murder trump supporters should we ban bernie from speaking then
socialism,removed,in the us law we have the first amendment there is no exception for hate speech hateful ideas are just as protected as others this is lawful reality reddit is a us site milo was speaking in the us hateful ideas are the kinds of challenging ideas people need to be exposed to too people need to be exposed to these kinds of things so that they can build up ideological resistances to them we dont want hate we want rational critical thought if you are intent on educating people about dangerous ideas educate them about the results of those dangerous ideas too i agree with this sentiment with the too added at the end people absolutely do need to be exposed to the horrors that happen when ultra left or ultra right leaning policies run their course they end in mass graves and killing fields from personal experience i can tell you that whenever i gave a lesson about the horrific results of nazi germany the right wing students in my class were awed and silent when i discussed contemporary politics including the right wing ideas they felt emboldened you do not challenge fascism by giving their ideas a platform they thrive by getting a platform it is dangerous and there is no place for it in college or anywhere you only end up validating if you are intent on educating people about dangerous ideas educate them about the results of those dangerous ideas you seem to be saying that you view right wing ideas as being interchangeable with fascism and nazi ideology and you seem to be disappointed that you could not turn your students away from right wing leaning politics younger adults can get politically polarized at a young age left or right depending on what group of people they hang around with what their family believes this happens with ideology and religion among other things some people never growth out of the environment conditioning they never learn critical thinking skills necessary to think for themselves thats most likely what is going on with those within your class they have been polarized it will take time for them to grow up into people who can think for themselves if they ever do and the best way for them to reach that is mass exposure to ideas and time for them to think things through it cannot be forced it is a natural process if they dont ever learn critical thinking skills then they grow up into ideologues who stick to a ridged core dogma and seek ideologue purity they become people who think they have the facts already and only look for evidence to back up their claims instead of looking at what the evidence says the facts are i do not need your condescension fuck off i was asking if you understood what i meant in that calling him a nazi only makes more people get drawn to listening to him instead of actually being effective if you want people to not listen to him then calling him a nazi only makes people listen to him more do what you want but if you want to make things better there are better ways to go at it
socialism,removed,what the fuck is wrong with you seriously good job destroying a bunch of shit to get your way terrorist
socialism,removed,how are the right radicalized im pretty centre leaning more left than right but you guys seem like the real fascists here
socialism,removed,there are blm members who want white genocide should we then not allow them to speak
socialism,removed,you cant even have a debate just no good talk
socialism,removed,trump supporters are fascists and im out
socialism,removed,except for people you personally agree with right
socialism,removed,bi isnt quite journalistic there and seems as so often to have a sharp liberal in the sense of us liberal leaning the write polarization and support for trump up
socialism,removed,what
socialism,removed,yeah lets beat up everyone who disagrees fucking fascists those thrashcans and windows were fascists too fuck em
socialism,removed,thank god the people in this sub have no wealth and no social mobility id hate to see any of you have any sort of responsibilities
socialism,removed,you do the s after but the funny thing is is that in any sane subreddit this would be a valid comment without it
socialism,removed,theyre hurting people but themselves arent allowed to get hurt thats why they always sucker punch and use masks i guess
socialism,removed,because liberals restrict the free market from making these people wealthy there is a reason higher unemployment goes hand and hand with higher minimum wages stronger union and labor laws its called econ
socialism,removed,so are you advocating that people who own homes be forced to give them up where is the justice in that the homeless couldnt afford them anyway
socialism,removed,youre blind if you actually believe that mate
socialism,removed,some of the stuff that happened in berkley last night was unacceptable you cant just call anyone you dont agree with a fascist or a nazi there are real nazis out there and by throwing the term around youre devaluing the message we had a milo supporter shoot someone at a milo speech the other week we had a riot yesterday with innocent folk being attacked just because someone wears a make america great again hat or goes to see milo it does not make them a fascist the same way that if people protest against milo it does not mean they are all black block or antifa people need to choose their battles better there are far right white supremacists getting in to positions of power in america the focus should be more on them milo is a mouthpiece who loves the drama he brings but hes fundamentally not dangerous yeah protest him but dont think that because someone likes him that they are a nazi that you can attack that is bullshit and it needs to be looked at from both the left and the right real far right groups are the ones that the far left should be after real fascists that literally want genocide and to persecute people based on their racereligionskin colour these are the ones that they should be attacking as they want people dead attacking some girl because she wears a trump hat is absolutely not on its not acceptable and should be condemned by the left same as a milo supporter shooting a left protestor the other week this should be condemned by the right choose your battles wisely or your actions will become muddled and youll just gain the other side to garner more support
socialism,removed,why are there poor people because they dont work or are addicted and have debt
socialism,removed,you did the right thing hopefully next time the commie is beat out of you though
socialism,removed,thank liberal economic policy that rises the cost of doing business expensive taxi licensing fees and such to where a lot of that revenue has to be spent covering those costs to begin with of the market was freer there would be more wealth to spread around
socialism,removed,way to go guys instead of milo speaking to people and nobody giving a fuck now everyone cares about it the radical left are full of retards
socialism,removed,human rights like someone dying due to getting hit in the head with a shovel
socialism,removed,whats funny is most oppressive and failed states result from left leaning authoritarian powers freedom and socialism have never aligned and never will
socialism,removed,it just shows how much these idiots know about who they are protesting hes literally gay how can he be antigay retards
socialism,removed,okay mate youre right theres going to be mass genocide on civilians every day people of statue and authority are calling for mass genocide i must have just somehow missed it best of luck
socialism,removed,marking everyone you dont like as against people doesnt give you the right to kill them this subreddit is absolutely disgusting right now
socialism,removed,this subreddit is a good laugh i hope youre all roleplaying though
socialism,removed,if theres going to be any mass murders its because people like these protesters youre celebrating drive the wedge so hard into society splitting it so far and so fast that it erupts when people finally believe that violence is their only choice
socialism,removed,i have a story i was once suffering from depression while my grandfather was starting to lose his memory and rapidly deteriorate we were close the only thing at that point in my life that helped me push through was the small business i own and run i work at my job for over hours a week and couldnt love it more we give back to the community and hire vets and ex convicts who find difficulty in finding a steady job one day when i was feeling particularly down someone approached me with the ideas of socialism and you know what they made me feel even worse my day went from bad to shit because this guy really believed i was a selfish pig didnt work hard didnt do enough for other people and didnt deserve the massive profits my company is raking in hint we arent and i give myself a very modest salary i guess what im getting at here is that i worked my ass off and helped a lot of people along the way through my own personal choice and i guess im the bad guy my business and hard work should be taken from me and given to people without the drive and passion i hold no wonder this shit had never worked never will and is a utopian fantasy land
socialism,removed,socialism
socialism,removed,suppression of different opinions yep thats socialism for you
socialism,removed,thanks for the help with unit conversation i now know that altright gulag
socialism,removed,when your arguments are so weak you gotta protest and start fires in fear of letting others have a voice
socialism,removed,the action of the rioters not the peaceful protesters and comments in this thread have shown me and a lot of others in this nation why we really dont want socialism in this country just as we dont want the extremealt right the actions are so similar to the those of the altright and extreme right advocate its almost ironic you guys have shown that neither of the above stated philsophies are compatible with anything remotley smiliar to actual freedom its also funny how every time someone brings up that past socialist nations everyone schreeches that they werent really socialist well what those shitty nations did and what the berkely rioters did and comments here agree with to squash free speech are earily similar unwelcome ideas will clearly be dealt with by force whether it was in the ussr north korea or the socilaistsanarchists in this country you guys try to dostance yourselves from past forms of socialism yet your actions are almost exactly the same
socialism,removed,gonna get what ya give commie fuckstick free helicopter rides
socialism,removed,no one takes socialism seriously enough to ban it itd be like duct taping a year olds mouth
socialism,removed,are you trying to be ironic saying you wont tolerate a form of speech is literally a tenant of fascismagain if anyone here says that past socilist nations dont represent the current ideology all you have to do is show them these riots and this thread so please accept that you are a lot more simliar to those regines than you want to oublicly admit also i like how you had no actual retort to my comment im glad to know i was right in what i wrote
socialism,removed,let them free to ramble about how black people are inferiors and muslims are a cancer you do it again how do you know every so called facsist has these opinions many of you build up this boogeyman of what every trump supporter or non socialist is truth is those are mostly normal people violence should only ever be used as an answer to violence not to let out agression because democracy isnt going the way you want and never because someone wants to hold a speech at a campus and what a surprise it backfired milo got more coverage than he could possibly get out of a normal speech im sorry but i simply see no point in punching a motionless guy pepperspraying a peaceful woman and robbing a starbucks those are the same retards who burn down mosques and refugee camps
socialism,removed,nah we won that won authoritarian shitheels like you lost except in soviet russia of course but they also lost eventually
socialism,removed,yall are scum for condoning the violence
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,and the millions of women the soviets raped im sure fortunately idiotic communists got theirs in the end
socialism,removed,are the skinheads you are mentioning just trump supporters or people part of some white nationalist group its honestly sickening seeing people celebrating people who are just trump supporters being beaten half to death
socialism,removed,so much is said about milo im honestly seeing what hes about i dislike his use of some words in certain contexts but hes really a pretty run of the mill conservative the student entered into the public on their own initiative participating in news stories local tv news student paper sharing their name and face months before milo brought attention to them for example if any reasonable person saw justine they would say that was a man in a dress thats all milo said about them i think your misinformed i do especially hate bringing private people into the public eye but this person was not private
socialism,removed,kill a commie for mommy
socialism,removed,eat a dick
socialism,removed,animals
socialism,removed,they are killing people dude
socialism,removed,kind of like what the left does towards anyone with even slightly conservative point of view
socialism,removed,a socialist who hates nazis thats some irony right their this form of socialism where you go out in the streets and beat up people you dont like or with whom you disagree with is literally the exact same kind of socialism hitler practiced my only question is do you guys get your brown shirts from the same vendor or does your mommy sew them for you
socialism,removed,how is he a nazi im not going to believe hes one just cause everyone calls him one and it sounds like you are condoning attacking someone for something that may or may not happen in the future have you ever considered that you may be wrong and now youre side is just attacking people
socialism,removed,yeah i hope the family of the dead officer is doing okay and will be able to not have their lives fucked up from this and the female officer in the hospital currently will recover and be able to return to her job to continue providing for her family
socialism,removed,do you view them as police first humans second or humans first police second i view them as people who are now dead and their families are probably in an awful state the day we stop having humanity for other humans is a dark day
socialism,removed,but who is a fascist ah yes everyone who isnt you
socialism,removed,looks like the banned subreddit is starting to disperse into rnews yeah a lot of rleftwithsharpedge idiocy in rnews today
socialism,removed,so youre okay with killing him id say you have the least humanity out of all especially being distant to the situation
socialism,removed,she looks like a violent alt righter so does this guy and his female friends httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgsmkgrywkas
socialism,removed,she looks like a violent alt righter so does this guy and his female friends httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgsmkgrywkas
socialism,removed,bash yourself cause you guys are the facists
socialism,removed,ahh another socialist who likes to redefine the idea of socialism to fit their world view because they cant stand the idea that their world view and nazism are one in the same
socialism,removed,lel you guys are pathetic try this shit in a state where people have a right to self defence and see how brave you are
socialism,removed,the guy is literally a jew how can he be a nazi
socialism,removed,if are allowed to spread their ideology which is based around attacking and taking away the rights of anyone they deem unpure then people will get attacked and killed how can anyone possibly defend put an ygroup jews muslims etc into that you are a fascist
socialism,removed,yet you still only throw tantrums like this in states and cities with restrictive gun and self defence laws
socialism,removed,shutting down speech any speech is fascism
socialism,removed,so what about the girl who was pepper sprayed because she had a make bitcoins great again hat on the guy who was beaten with a shovel or the guy who was chased by an angry mob with a bike lock im worried about real examples of violence and real actions rather than somebodys right to say mean things on twitter now lets talk about people what about the owners and employees of the starbucks that was destroyed what about the school employees the owners and employees of the stores that were destroyed the people whos cars were burned the people who were attacked the people who were threatened or the residents of the town and campus that now have to clean up and live in the middle of the shit the rioters created youre talking about oppression but literally the only people engaged in the act of oppression are you how is milo oppressing people by saying mean things how are you folks oppressing people by literally beating threatening banning and destroying anything or anybody who has the balls to say now wait a second lets think about this so tell me again whos worried about people and whos worried about playing victim as they beat and destroy anything who dares to question them
socialism,removed,wtf i love terrorism now
socialism,removed,whats this got to do with socialism
socialism,removed,this board is cancerous great to know that none of you will reproduce go and prep the black bull commie cucks
socialism,removed,this is still a bit suspicious
socialism,removed,so just to be clear by your own admission you value property over people and the dude who shot somebody outside of a milo event there is also no evidence he was a milo fan and even if he was micah xavier johnson was a blm supporter but nobody on the right is calling for violence to shut down blm unless they start the violence then the police have a right to get involved to protect people i dont care one iota about starbucks awful things happen and its terrible but its ridiculous to ask people not to show their contempt for the system because the systems supporters might be inconvenienced or worse so you dont care about people only people who agree with you and lets be clear the small business owners who just had their lives ruined and the people who have to deal with the chaos and aftermath arent inconvenienced and its absolutely okay you dont get to ruin somebodys life through violence because you disagree with them and nobody is being deported because of race or religion explain to me how restricting travel to people from of the muslim majority nations which were namd by the obama administration as exporters of terrorism is deporting people based on race and religion racist political platform which exerts violence against people due to race or religion and the other choice being the swaths people who are seeing violence enacted against them for the crime of merely existing so like the trump supporters who get dragged from their cars and beaten simply for existing do they count and lets look at which side has been responsible for more violence which side has been calling for actual violence nobody who you people claim advocate for violence actually advocate for violence meanwhile you folks are actively and openly trying to start violence the slaves are revolting and burning our beautiful plantation theres that victim complex again how are uc berkeley students arguably some of the most privileged people in the entire world slaves a fascist getting pepper sprayed you dont know her her views her beliefs or anything in the interview she states she doesnt necessarily support milo but just wants to make a statement by being there now lets go over the definition of fascism a political philosophy movement or regime as that of the fascisti that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader severe economic and social regimentation and forcible suppression of opposition exalts race and nation over individual differences check centralized government with massive power to the guy in charge check severe economic and social regimentation check forcible suppression of opposition milo was providing an opposing viewpoint so they forcibly suppressed him and people interested in hearing him speak you are a fascist these rioters are fascists you dont get to call people you dont like fascist like its just an insult so at least be intellectually honest and call yourself what you actually are a fascist
socialism,removed,i really am ambivolent about this because i feel like haters gonna hate let them do their thing hate speech or whatever dont be a pussy and snitch to the authorities
socialism,removed,okay so in order to stop nazis we must destroy random property is that how it works
socialism,removed,wow just wow while liberal commies kicking shit out of innocent people women included pepper spraying them and burning down now even schools the altright is the one who is causing violence and gets banned liberals you had your chance for years and we lived with it no matter how much we hated obamas policy there was no mass rioting no vandalizing no sucker punching no american flag burning this just shows how different we are
socialism,removed,i guarantee you the people inside fantasize about getting a chance at martial law and drool over the idea of shooting libtards
socialism,removed,nope its criminals destroying things and attacking other people
socialism,removed,that is false
socialism,removed,you mean that self defense shooting very aware of it
socialism,removed,jimmy dore is hardly a comedian and likes to spread his disgusting diseases by spitting on his opponents
socialism,removed,glad someone finally got retribution for their violent bullshit
socialism,removed,across europe less than a hundred years ago tens of millions died from hunger and government purges what efficient and just economic system could produce such an outcome
socialism,removed,good
socialism,removed,so dont address his argument then
socialism,removed,the free market lets prices fall
socialism,removed,wish it was more
socialism,removed,socialistsmarxists are not fascist but like the fascist they use violence to get the means to their goals there are currently no real fascists in western nations if they were they would literally fight a ground war with the antifas right now as the nazi stormtroopers did with the commies back then
socialism,removed,a public water distribution system fails so they hire a private company to manage the reconstruction the city board lays off important decision makers in the project to save public funds and it backfired and somehow thats at fault of privatized business the same business that successfully put in water systems in other cities the problem here is the city government telling the private company how to run their project case closed
socialism,removed,maybe you wouldnt have to if you made a good speech and yes this is also in violation of free speech i take issue with it as well
socialism,removed,theres a distinct difference with capitalism you have a chance you have a choice you can be among the poorest and work for something get a degree and be successful you could also be insanely rich waste your money and lose it all its all based on how you do and what you do with your life in socialism you put your trust in a government that is already under scrutiny and have no control over your own life or how you have access to food or water
socialism,removed,wavering over milos feels or the wanton violence that could have cost someone their life this is how ridiculous youve become milo isnt even a fascist or altrighter no matter how much hes tried to coopt the term from them they hate him hes an antipc libertarian whos openly flamboyantly gay with a preference for men of african descent sound like someone a fascist would care for people are wavering because your movement has gone off the rails into a caricature of itself
socialism,removed,can i get a source on that im interested
socialism,removed,oh you can debate them right now i already do i oppose their viewpoints via nonviolent methods and by spreading better views opposing views that make sense and work through equality and love and not hate also instead of working to fight fascism i think of equality first hes got his viewpoints hell likely express them regardless of violence against them regardless of people trying to censor him i mean wouldnt you if it was something you really believed in so therefore i work to change peoples minds and by showing people the direct results of the viewpoints i believe in i tell people to be in a community and accept each other and embrace what brings us together and i do activities with them i encourage healthy debate i remind ourselves of our difference and of the beauty and awe of the things created by people coming together i try to create a world where fascism can be stated for sure but one will quickly abandon this belief because they realize its nonsensical and it alienates them and again free speech ends when it always has when someone makes a direct threat to you or your freedom you oppose them it can be a little vague certainly but i hope to not have to get there and focus instead on making a better world by emphasizing the positive then dwelling on the negative and either way a simple answer is not at uc berkeley last night people shouldnt have been harassed and attacked and beaten just for trying to see a speaker that they paid for
socialism,removed,good for them
socialism,removed,lemme guess comments section is a bunch of people disagreeing with each other while somehow all being wrong yup
socialism,removed,actually it is more like multilevel marketing the people at the top get most of the residual income from the people below who work hard to produce sales
socialism,removed,capitalism works to see who can be the best among industries and provides a way to compete as who can produce the most needed product when one ends up with a huge advantage redistribution needs to happen to balance out the industry a time of socialism socialism always happens at the end of capitalism as parties fight against each other and redistribute the wealth
socialism,removed,how did you know im a classical liberal
socialism,removed,quick dont the sjw cucks see this
socialism,removed,and then they buy cars and houses and jewelry and stocks thus redistributing their money to thousands of workers and then they personally employ drivers and gardeners and housekeepers and caterers and pool men and mechanics and thats if they just fuck around all day and live multiply the distribution of wealth by if they run a business
socialism,removed,yeah poor people help the economy so much so glad they employ everyone and create more jobs for everyone in the country and spend money oh wait thats rich people
socialism,removed,how dare he have opposing views and not every teacher be a socialist liberal
socialism,removed,who decides what is and isnt acceptable cant you see where these limits on free speech are inherently dangerous by giving people the power to censor what is deemed as not allowed
socialism,removed,uh no first of all corporations make most of the profit not individuals and corporations use their profits to hire and build individuals in the use their personal fortunes to spend save or invest no matter which outcome occurs all capital gets recycled throughout the economy there are no holes into which money disappears all money always moves from the top into the middle class who either save spend or invest themselves moving cash either down to the lower income class through smaller purchases or back up to the banks or corporations money circulates everyone enjoys the accrued benefit of a cashpositive economy
socialism,removed,itt idiots who majored in sculpting and are pissed theyre not paid
socialism,removed,they usually did it by working and making good choices
socialism,removed,but industry in the ussr was absurdly inefficient
socialism,removed,i really doubt the legitimacy of this
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,trickle down isnt crazy for poor countries attracting capital away from rich countries helps them modernize and expand their means of production it is totally nuts when applied to rich countries like usa japan and most of europe they already have all the capital and do t get much benefit from attracting more
socialism,removed,you know for people who take credit for the end of the third reich you commies sure are antiisrael and antisemitic

socialism,removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikinorilsk
socialism,removed,okay mom
socialism,removed,id question the idea that socialists in the us should dump the democratic party the election rules in the us make a viable third party at a national level very difficult so it makes sense for electoral work to be conducted within the democrats backing those socialist and progressive candidates in primaries and beyond
socialism,removed,its a quote by a historical figure take it up with him
socialism,removed,fascism is socialism though two sides of the same coin of government control and tyranny
socialism,removed,so doxxing is too extreme for fascists now
socialism,removed,the reason there are so many people that love castro in cuba is they get indoctrinated to love him in school and castro and guevara executed everyone who disagreed with them politicallyand their families the also killed thousands of gay people as well as executing many people without a trial so yeah i can see people having some grievances about that

socialism,removed,theres this image in the us that ive noticed mostly from the liberals that the common working person is insufferably stupid i never believed it but im glad to see this video and i think we need more visibility of people like him we cant have just the intellectuals voicing problems of the poor and working class while our culture our media often lampoons poor people on tv making them look dumb theyre not dumb
socialism,removed,like two or more years ago but again not an actual thing my dumbass just used to use it during that period when i was moving from lib soc back to leninism
socialism,removed,every single socialist government in history has been a failure at best and a murderous disaster at worst but good luck getting anyone on this sub to pull their head out of their own ass long enough to admit it
socialism,removed,how does one most effectively doxx someone theres a few vectors i can think of that would potentially expose a persons identity but i have no way of implementing them
socialism,removed,yep

socialism,removed,they sound like idiots to be honest and idiots are in every faction i knew a bunch of anarchists who loved to talk about how committed to justice they were but they werent committed enough to actually do anything about it but that doesnt mean i think anarchists in general act like that but yeah those guys just sound very confused i mean how can you be a marxist and think a sjw is a bad thing like arent you supposed to be a social justice warrior if youre fighting for communism
socialism,removed,thats my line xd did someone say space communism
socialism,removed,lenin was nowhere near to being as authoritarian as people say he was he was the bamf of his time tied with nikola tesla to be the most bamf of all time
socialism,removed,i wonder if they were stripping down naked during the siberian winter also you have made me picture lenin naked i am not complaining at all
socialism,removed,as a white male living in the usa i do not know where this term came from hillary is the first person i have heard use this term i think it is a way for hillary to put people like myself into the racistbigot class i am not a racist or a bigot and this language is insulting a racist is a racist a bigot is a bigot a white male who has different opinions than you does not necessarily constitute either

socialism,removed,the good news is everyone got too busy worrying about words to pay attention to the point of your comment the revolution has been cancelled due to offensive language
socialism,removed,and we should denigrate ourselves to trumps standards
socialism,removed,how to lose any and all credibility in one easy step
socialism,removed,so i wont encounter a wild jason unruhe around here haha
socialism,removed,so what they are saying is that he is a fascist because he says mean things meanwhile mexicans actually treat central americans like dirt scum dogs and subhumans deporting and jailing them letting them be trafficked and killed by narcos etc etc yeah makes sense fucking hypocrites

socialism,removed,mexican culture hahahaha
socialism,removed,because circle jerk trump bad thats about the extent of it
socialism,removed,do you fucking retards even listen to yourselves talk
socialism,removed,by typing this you are being ableist imagine how people with no finger or the paralyzed in fact even living is ableist as it mocks those who dont have the privilege of being alive and to top it all off youre communicating in a manner mocking to the disabled and celebrating your privelege by typing one a machine invented to aid the military industrial complex and whose innovation was fueled by capitalism disgusting
socialism,removed,its almost as if capitalism contains an ideological imperative to justify the steady replacement of skilled labour with machines and the very existence of class society by appealing to the intelligence of individuals
socialism,removed,he pmd me to say that my views are retarded so yeah ill assume hes a troll
socialism,removed,i mean im indian but i like trump because hes enforcing the laws on the book i assume some mexicans who came here legally arent too happy with the ones who come illegally
socialism,removed,who fuckin cares
socialism,removed,crying wolf
socialism,removed,who gives a shit if anybody is offended seriously offense is a horrible guideline to go by some of our users are offended at being called tankies some of our users are offended at flaws in their analysis being pointed out offense can happen for many reasons and isnt particularly meaningful but what is meaningful is what youre saying if youre calling someone these words you are accusing someone of being unintelligent and implying that you are better than them because of it fuck that there is nothing wrong with being unintelligent despite the fact that our culture treats unintelligent people as being lesser we live in a culture that has routinely victimized unintelligent people exploited them and sometimes experimented upon and killed them it doesnt matter if that swath of the population identifies that way or not it doesnt matter if theyre actually offended or not what matters is whether or not youre using language in a way that reenforces bigotry against marginalized peoples
socialism,removed,immigrants who came through customs got examined by doctors for infectious diseases and quarantined if they were ill had to show some indication they wanted to assimilate and become a citizen my family came here from ireland before the civil war they fought for their new country stop belittling their hard work and their love of the greatest nation on earth by lumping them in with criminals

socialism,removed,socialismlmao free money for everyone no one has to work and we all get to live like rock stars becauserich people suk lmao have fun cutting open that goose to get all those shiny golden eggslmao
socialism,removed,who founded this country is a weak argument we are talking about today not the past arent against immigration most are against jose blowsesee what i did there just strolling across the border with zero notification paperwork background checks etc that goes for asians canadians europeans etc that said if you can stop people from walking across without a wall fence tech drones aliens robot bees etc then speak up we are all ears no one cares about mexicans or brown well im sure some do but we dont take those people seriously its about common sense the same common sense that the mexicans use when dealing with their own southern border aside from changing their laws recently to not look like hypocrites they are doing the same shit and having the same issues we are all while shitting on trump for wanting to do the same things they want to do funny
socialism,removed,it is the idealogy of life itself as well but hey lets ignore that
socialism,removed,whelp i will now be adding this subreddit to the blocked list sadly i believe socialism is a great thing but you guys dont really seem to give a shit about helping each other you seem to rather hate each other enjoy your circlejerk

socialism,removed,yea because fast food is such an essential and supportive service to our society they should make bucks and hour just like the price of cigerates is working
socialism,removed,it would be extremely unacceptable to most people its also impractical for other reasons
socialism,removed,you dont have to work for his companies
socialism,removed,hah good luck with that
socialism,removed,you kids are so cute
socialism,removed,here is the great thing you can already be your own boss if you were not a panty waste communist what you are describing is taking other peoples property so your lazy fucking ass can benefit you want money go earn it
socialism,removed,because these posts and comments are so amusing this sub shows up in all so its in my feed anyway at one point in my life i was very left politically and i guess i read these posts to kind of see what my own experiences lead me away from that yes in a perfect world there may well be universal basic income and nobody will have jobs that they dont like but to that point i see people commenting shit like we need to seize the means of production and have upvotes its like you asked why i was here
socialism,removed,you dont have to worry where you jobs went im a private lender i fully finance almost every single deal brought to me my borrowers literally dont have to bring a penny to the property rehab deals i finance there are people like me everywhere for industries of all sorts money is out there so you can be in control of your own destiny you dont have to wait around to get fired go ask someone for money and be your own boss its almost that easy many of my borrowers have never done a rehab project in their entire lives but theyre motivated by the prospect of financial freedom so we provide them with the resources to achieve that goal i have millions of dollars that i cant invest fast enough my investors are breathing down my neck to find places to put their money you can sit around and wait for someone to change your life or you can change it yourself
socialism,removed,demand fair wages next thing you say we should demand jobs from these rch folks because they owe us get real poorpeopleproblems
socialism,removed,trump will take us back to prosperity hi from td
socialism,removed,so steal from the person who spent all the money to build the business because they no longer need employees
socialism,removed,steal because i cant contribute
socialism,removed,or you could do a hell of a job and get raises on your own merits and move up or you could switch to a different employer that pays more or you could start your own business and pay yourself whatever you want
socialism,removed,yeah and i want a free unicoren too
socialism,removed,if your job can be replaced by automation easily and its cheaper than paying you a living wage you need to start training for a new job right now thats fast food which wasnt supposed to ever be a career btw in the coming decades it might be mowing lawns or software development whatever it is dont rest on your laurelskeep learning and make yourself valuable dont depend on the government to dictate your wage
socialism,removed,wow thats pretty aggressive and uncalled for op was complaining about waiting to get fired and being without a job all i did was provide some insight into one possible way of controlling hisher own destiny i apologize for interrupting the sad circlejerk
socialism,removed,if a man takes a risk of to start a business with a loan and it fails will the workers put their money in a pot to save him from bankruptcy no so why should they get a share of his profits
socialism,removed,you will still only get the machines because of the free market oh and the real world
socialism,removed,big companys make money in spite of there employees not because of them because they sell or make a good or needed product or serviceits a privilege to get a job and trade your time for a wage and if that wage is not enough for you to live on then change the way you live or your jobthese companies owe you nothingmake yourself more useful and youll be more valuable
socialism,removed,you get the wage the free economy gives you with limited socialized necessary services otherwise you can go to an ass backwards socialist country like venezuela cuba or russia seriously get the fuck out
socialism,removed,stealing the surplus value you mean making profit on an investment those people are paid for the value of their work
socialism,removed,so start a company that manufactures machines that can replace workers and pay your employees fair wages instead of bitching on the internet
socialism,removed,whatever they need to do hours a week is hours a day nothing wrong with taking a few hours a week and pursuing something more marketable than running a fryer lots of people work hour days then do a class or two then hit the books its not impossible its just harder than asking the government to give you a raise
socialism,removed,wishful thinking and rabble rousing on reddit is equivalent to masturbation it feels good for a bit but in the end nothing changes they dont and wont share stop pretending you can influence change through social media youre playing their game theyre laughing at you at us socialism isnt real except as a theory until machines control our governments we will be beholden to selfishness if you were at the top youd do the same damn thing as this guy or youd be fired humans are flawed there is no changing that do the best you can for you and yours and stay positive be courageous and dont lie to yourself this world sucks for most of us and it always has tech wont change that until were humans no longer involved
socialism,removed,no go out there work hard and become rich yourselfor move to a socialist country and see what life is really like with out freedom and capitalism

socialism,removed,clinton because i am utterly convinced trump is the harbinger of apocalypse hopefully though sanders has started a general movement to the left in this country how far left is to be seen the socialist movement in the us is a joke its high time we make ourselves heard we need to be the loudest voice in the room american voters arent interested in rational thoughtful discussion they respond to emotion not logic
socialism,removed,lmao how can you take down a gulag joke but leave a wall one up like i personally have no problem with either but be consistent at least jesus
socialism,removed,socialists

socialism,removed,adds perspective to the post i am curious to know if someone that works for a living and pays a large chunk of money to the government would support something like socialism
socialism,removed,job no only the ones americans dont want to do
socialism,removed,ya liberal racist fuck and people upvoted this unfuckingbelievable
socialism,removed,the people are good but the government is bad is that a safe thing to say castros government made life so difficult for cubans that they couldnt get simple commodities like dairy products castro was so batshit crazy he wanted to breed a strain of cow that was the size of a dog and wanted each family to have one in their house he then wanted to build a giant infrastructure that was air conditioned and imported dairy cows only to find out they were too stressed to produce milk the man was batshit and ruled his people through the use of force and fear of death because of socialism cuba remains riddled with slums and poverty going further into it look at venezuela they are close to turning into an anarchy nation all because of chavez and his awful decision to back socialism the people of venezuela suffer now more than ever in history thanks to rampant gun control laws and gangs throttling the law abiding citizens by obtaining illegal guns how anyone can get behind total socialism is beyond me why cant you just be happy with elements of socialism coupled with elements of capitalism you cant have a welfare state without entrepreneurism
socialism,removed,this is great bets on how many of my brothers and sisters are going to stay here
socialism,removed,they are setting up a straw man to beat up on and try to be ironic on to prove their point you are not going to be the most popular here for pointing it out
socialism,removed,cuban doctors cant pass international exams they just arent what they used to be some people try to push the angle that its because the mean american rules and using english is what hurts them its not the also have an extremely high exam failure rate in other central and south american countries speaking and writing in their native language furthermore cuban trained doctors from other countries also have a much higher than usual failure rate for exams however in areas with little to no medical standards these doctors and their first aid or nurse level knowledge are waaay better than nothing they still do good in disaster areas
socialism,removed,unless youre being executed by the state
socialism,removed,we avoid arresting political prisoners and lgbtq citizens
socialism,removed,that would be because of our liberal government enforcing racist drug laws another example of the dangers of central planning
socialism,removed,they all can at any time cubas the only country in the world whose doctors can immediately practice in the us literally any one of them could defect and immediately pick up a job
socialism,removed,did you actually ban him for this nothing he said was trollish or hostile just ill informed is education something of value here
socialism,removed,if you are not a socialist but are learning about it be polite or you will be banned for trolling i saw them he was wrong but not malicious just ignorant of history and politics he didnt look to be just riling people up your subreddit ultimately but it doesnt cast a good light on the conversation that is allowed here if someone is banned just for having bad facts

socialism,removed,extremely biased interpretation im very pro israel and i wont shill for it here but you cant ignore that jews were also expelled from there respective countries when israel was founded the six day was started by the arab nations and israel tried to return gaza to egypt who didnt want it i can go farther into why i think the first bullet points are mischaracterizations but i dont want to get banned
socialism,removed,what are you doing in this subreddit if youre afraid youre going to get banned youre in the wrong place im bored look there are fine people who live in israel but you cannot ignore that it was founded as a colonial state by the west all of israels neighbors voted against its creation in the un jews had thoughts of their own they werent puppets of the west and they wanted to establish a state in an area that had no current state historical significance even ignoring the historical significance it was at the time a good location to make a state who says were ignoring that its relevant and unmentioned info that ignoring makes the arabs look completely innocent id even argue the circumstances of the jewish expulsion was much worse than the arab one were asserting that its improper to steal land from another set of oppressed people the expulsion was due to the circumstances of a war that the palestinians started that doesnt completely justify it but have some perspective and you mischaractarized it as if it was an israeli war of aggression to take palestinian land i cannot find a reputable source for this seriously do at least five seconds of research before writing about israel literally just google it and read the wikipedia page it might not be especially credible but its more or less unbiased and this is a very well known fact israel still has a barbaric blockade on gaza and bombed the hell out of it in the barbaric blockade to prevent hamas form throwing thousands of rockets again bombed the hell out of it in israel takes many measures to prevent civilian deaths roof knocking texting as opposed to hamas which specifically mixes their weapons and military targets with civilians to protect their weapons they dont give a shit about civilians beyond propaganda if they really didnt want the territory why hold onto it now because when israel left gaza militarily they elected a terrorist group and immediately launched thousands of rockets at them no you cant thats history its an unfair misrepresentation ill do it now im probably banned before i even finish writing this in a fringe group of zionists were granted support for their plan to build a jewish state in the territory known as palestine fringe vast majority of jews both then and now agree with the sentiment of a jewish state in the region there were jews before settling in kibbutzim being on this sub you should know this they are a famous instance of successful communes despite arabs having a much larger presence in the region not by the time the partition was made arabs would occupy around of their allotted land while jews wouldve occupied around of theirs smaller due to expected immigration from refugees in arab nations attack israel because its existence was seen as imperialist intrusion in the region i think it was antisemitism but there is no way to confirm either belief your comment shouldnt have been posted also youve never posted on this subreddit before you post in raskhillarysupporters i have a really long time ago for like the same reason as now i still dont like getting banned from places get the hell out of here you fucking reactionary ok
socialism,removed,the palestinians didnt have a national identity until fairly recently there was never a state occupying primarily that area since the jewish exodus the actual area was occupied by a somewhat sympathetic government and the immigration was legal and hardly immoral those people didnt have a government there the ottomans and then the british had a government there are you against immigration in general or only if jews do it
socialism,removed,theres a difference between immigrating somewhere and participating in the local government there wasnt a local government in palestine the first election for some kind of palestinian state was in the they had the permission of the governing body and forming a new state that is exclusionary towards the locals it wasnt still isnt in fact arabs who live in israel probably have the highest standard of life in the middle east inviting more people to move there to force the locals out even more adding jews to an area removing arabs which they didnt do after a jewish state was thoroughly established
socialism,removed,its no coincidence that this movie has been released days before elections if youre young these issues are going to affect you more than anyone else so enjoy the movie and then go out and vote dont let a climate denier wreck three decades of environmental activism and advocacy weve come a long way but there is still so much to do

socialism,removed,what pd has a departmental policy of deliberately targeting and killing black people
socialism,removed,if they truly cared it would be reflected in their actions and wed stop seeing outofwedlock births and single parent families mic drop
socialism,removed,not the same percentage at all
socialism,removed,yeah i focus more on interracial crime where blacks target whites at much higher percentages
socialism,removed,honest question do you think the problems that black people face in america are solely because of systematic ingrained racism or is there something that black people are doing wrong as well
socialism,removed,did you downvote my comment because i dont think censoring simple questions is very socialist of you anyways i was asking because i only always see one opinion or the other its always black and white and the world is often very much grey so i thought the problems within the black community were partly caused by racism and partly by some cultural aspect within the community if im wrong please correct me
socialism,removed,im not saying black culture is in any way a criminal one but i have observed some parts of black culture that could be problematic how black men in america treat women spend minutes on any black forum or even minutes on rblackpeopletwitter and youll see how many times the words bitch and side hoe are mentioned i think many black men in the ghettos cheat on their wives and this leads to many fatherless children who then unfortunately grow up to be criminals because they didnt have guidance this is of course pure anecdotal evidence i think the situation is like systematic racism and problems within black communites themselves i hope i wont be called a racist for having this perception
socialism,removed,downvotes push posts to the bottom of the page where fewer people are likely to see them how is this not a form of censorship especially when my comment was downvoted because people here dont like too many questions sounds a lot like real world censorship to me
socialism,removed,in america they are a significant minority that we arent going to write an angry comment first though
socialism,removed,im not a socialist if it means supporting those barbarians

socialism,removed,and yet somehow in all those words they dont manage to address the critical root of the word fascism etymology is your friend fascism comes from italian fasci a word obviously with roots in latin referring to a bundle of sticks or more usually a stylized representation of a bundle of sticks let me preface that the word faggot shares the same root and has the same meaning a bundle of sticks i share that only so i can allow the esteemed philosopher martin prince to explain the meaning of the symbol to you strength through unity is the summation of fascism now lets return to the italian use of the word fasci there the bundle referred to political groups they found strength in unity the media mogul benjamin franklin explains the natural danger in such reasoning very succinctly with his famous words join or die the group obviously prioritizes its own well being and individuals must not only conform to the group and sacrifice for the good of the group to gain admission but are also absolved from individual responsibility in the groups actions thats the danger in fascism the good is obvious what great work of man was created without the benefit of society alone we are simple animals without language without science however look to the natural world and there is little hope we will ever find some part small enough that it is not made up of smaller parts nor any whole large enough that it does not belong to some larger whole imagine the problem of governing a thousand people one strongest of them could rule all the others but with a single point of failure the whole is weak each one could have equal power in the group but the weak elderly children unfortunate would quickly be duped out of their trust by stronger members who would tear the whole to pieces you must have a balance and there is no magic formula you cannot say there must be ten groups of ten groups of ten people the cooperation that drives human success comes from balance these are the two ends of the spectrum that should always be in debate the individual against the whole that everyones favorite petulant brat thomas jefferson refers to as whigs and tories either side winning is disaster thats what you must know as you face a world in which the internet facilitates creating groups larger than any of our forebears could possibly have imagined humanity is not guaranteed success as a species think carefully where the needle stands between a single ruler for all of mankind and every man for himself before you try to push it one way or another do not forget there is a larger group of all life let that group life be your fasci and weigh carefully the balance of its parts the animals plants and kingdoms of men if you do this life will surely succeed and reach out to devour the universe from the nonliving

socialism,removed,you know who wont support revisionism and then hide behind a fallacy rproleschoolcool a subreddit where you can post pictures of your favorite old school revolutionaries looking boss i forgot i had that subreddit and i need to promote it
socialism,removed,she started it by ignoring to go to court
socialism,removed,she threatened them with a gun that is reason enough
socialism,removed,im sorry but anyone who uses their child as a human shield simultaneously threatening the police with a shotgun in a standoff is the scum of the earth if she had any semblance of humanity she would have tried to remove her child from the situation
socialism,removed,they did for hours do you really the police can just ignore illegality just because there is a child involved then anyone can just use a child and do whatever they want
socialism,removed,resisting arrest and disorderly conduct and multiple traffic violations
socialism,removed,maybe its not prudent to point a gun at police officers while your five year old sits next to you maybe you being dead after idiocy like that is a teensy bit your fault
socialism,removed,what the fuck is it with mentallyillpeoplearmedwithshotgunsholdingchildrenhostage apologists in this thread
socialism,removed,when you hold ala kid hostage and fire at police yourre lucky if you make it to jail who was right or wrong doesnt matter she made her choice to go down fighting and died theres no reason to cry injustice about that it was entierly her decision
socialism,removed,to bad che chavez and marx are all tankies who actually supported state capitalism
socialism,removed,he was in his youth before his radical change in politics cuba was in an apartheid state before che and the castros
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,i think theyre trying to troll actually the user has another trollish comment in this thread
socialism,removed,did you leave it gulag again
socialism,removed,or continually investing public money into bombing civilians nuclear weapons or supporting arms deals to fucking weapons grade cunts like the saudis
socialism,removed,national socialism is required
socialism,removed,this myth again
socialism,removed,i cant speak for americans but in the eu the farleft is not necessary any more because of the eus successes the euro which reduced inflation workers rights more investment for the poorer nations less power for extremist leftist groups like syriza in greece to actually do anything if they got into power the radical rightwing becoming in many places paneuropean rather than nationalist which is harder for people to oppose
socialism,removed,indian farmers are due to monsantos cotton in fact it is httpiimgurcombulrmhmpng every major study shows that httpsenwikipediaorgwikifarmerssuicidesinindiagmcrops
socialism,removed,praising an idiotic intellectuals contribution to one of the worst genocides of the last years what a shitty subreddit this is
socialism,removed,i see we are back to recycling old lies
socialism,removed,can we add nigger hate as a socialist doctrine i would join then
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,what does sleekerys comment history have anything to do with the fact that the monsanto has caused suicides claim is just plain false the shill accusation just shows that you have nothing intelligent left to say please just go away
socialism,removed,i gave proof backed with real evidence do you dispute the facts presented
socialism,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikifilebtcottonhectaresandfarmersuicidestimetrendindiapng
socialism,removed,they are paying me so much money i just need to work jobs instead of jobs
socialism,removed,proven wrong personal attacks its simply a fact that monsanto seeds havent caused an epidemic in indian farmer suicides in fact it looks like it has helped prevent them
socialism,removed,deny these suicides one more time and ill make it my personal crusade to inform every sub on reddit what you are im shaking in my monsantobought shoes
socialism,removed,yes because your article provides no new factual information
socialism,removed,reddit search function
socialism,removed,five independent individuals both coincidentally manage to use the search function to refute claims yes there are a few other progmo posters that seem to also use the search function made on a sub none of them have ever posted to all at the same time i dont think you understand the purpose of a search function
socialism,removed,what evidence do you have supports one single company is responsible for suicides the amount of evidence for your claim is thin at best i dont like monsanto too but are we creating this imagination of this monster to make it look scary than it really is antimonsanto propaganda kinda reminds me of the antirothschild propaganda
socialism,removed,anything antigmo or antigmo by proxy notice how absolutely none of you have done anything to refute any of the arguments against the ops article not one all you people are doing are insulting us as people its clear that youre wrong that you know that youre wrong and that youre simply attacking us to try to distract from everyone realizing that youre wrong
socialism,removed,i hope he died screaming
socialism,removed,your parroting of long ago debunked bullshit wont pass scrutiny outside of this heavily censored echo chamber
socialism,removed,why do you intentionally encourage this sub to be an echo chamber
socialism,removed,the claims about farmer suicides in india are inherently about the failure of gmos
socialism,removed,states millions of people in china were violently persecuted during the cultural revolution those identified as spies running dogs revisionists or coming from a suspect class including those related to former landlords or rich peasants were subject to beating imprisonment rape torture sustained and systematic harassment and abuse seizure of property denial of medical attention and erasure of social identity at least hundreds of thousands of people were murdered starved or worked to death millions more were forcibly displaced young people from the cities were forcibly moved to the countryside where they were forced to abandon all forms of standard education in place of the propaganda teachings of the communist party of china
socialism,removed,httpwwwskepticalraptorcomskepticalraptorblogphplogicalfallaciesshillgambitlogicalfallacies
socialism,removed,the actual reality of the issue those points are notably absent from the arguments being made by environmental activists like vandana shiva note ive apparently been downvoted enough in this sub that my comments are being throttled so my replies are delayed
socialism,removed,no thats actually been a bit of a trend in india but activists took stories about that and tried to link it to gmos an indian journalist popularized the phenomenon before gmos were even a thing in india httpsenwikipediaorgwikipalagummisainath he never linked it to monsanto or gmos the subject has now been fairly well researched in academia the subject of gmos is settled unfortunately theres billions of dollars worth of industries that have to fight against gmos its directly or indirectly linked to how they make their living the better description for most of the people getting called shills is skeptics thats what i am
socialism,removed,we should make monsanto illegal in india so the whole lot of them starve to death suicide problem fixed
socialism,removed,i know its kind of a controversial opinion here but i think we as socialists should have a conversation about abortion a woman has complete absolute unquestionable control over her body no ifs ands or buts about that but at what point does it stop being her body im not asking to argue im really just proposing a genuine question that im grappling with i mean theres a human being in there or at least something that will become one what makes their will or their life any less important than the mothers again im really not trying to piss anyone off or even play devils advocate but im really not comfortable with how dismissive we can be of the completely nonreligious humanrights concerned criticisms of abortion
socialism,removed,yeah thats the problem
socialism,removed,this sub doesnt value free speech unfortunately
socialism,removed,i dont know how many times that ive seen socialists on reddit saying that capitalism leads to slavery so what happened to your beloved venezuela ps days of forced labor is slavery
socialism,removed,he would hide in his cave in kamchatka while nazis invade the soviet union
socialism,removed,its a old joke about trotsky in turkeymany of the marxislenninist call him pussy and son of a bitchhere you can with your own songs title is for the dishonorable trotsky my comrade is mao
socialism,removed,stfu fool
socialism,removed,until the system becomes overburdened and abused by those who wish to do so socialism requires an absolute ton of regulations and oversight to work while everybody with an aspiration to be the biggest dickhead attempts to find loopholes in the system and cause a drain on the entire network nothing like giving the keys to the food cabinet to the politicians and expecting their to be any cookies left over when they get first picks
socialism,removed,so sad to see sweden self destruct like france
socialism,removed,here is your hack
socialism,removed,step one done and you only need to be to join
socialism,removed,and here we wanted to us to stop the election and take a year off to regroup good thing were all militia a gift of rights for everybody
socialism,removed,its a bit immature imo there is nothing wrong with supporting progressivism over revolutionary change every proponent of social democracy like corbyn or sanders gets us a little closer to the ideal society things dont happen overnight and if they do they usually fail as public opinion cant adjust that fast
socialism,removed,i was wondering why the fuck anyone would actually buy into socialism but then i realized what subreddit i was in
socialism,removed,capitalism is voluntary tell me how venezuelas new forced labor in the fields is not slavery
socialism,removed,the sixhour work day is not as effective as one would think to stay focused on a specific work task for six hours is a huge challenge in order to cope we mix in things and pauses to make the work day more endurable at the same time we are having it hard to manage our private life outside of work
socialism,removed,you vaginas really hate working hard dont you my fellow millennials are pathetic im working hour weeks in sales i used to work hours a week in a degree celsius factory doing hard labor sad bunch no wonder youre all never going to achieve anything in your lives
socialism,removed,are you talking about sterilisation for criminals its not a terrible idea
socialism,removed,the fourhour work day is not as effective as one would think to stay focused on a specific work task for four hours is a huge challenge in order to cope we mix in things and pauses to make the work day more endurable at the same time we are having it hard to manage our private life outside of work
socialism,removed,geez calm down did i say sterilisation of all criminals no i didnt so stop putting words in my mouth youre being so selfrighteous of course were not going to sterilise someone for carrying weed im prolegalisation but i do think if there are repeated instances of violent behaviour and medical opinion is that a reduction in testosterone would help mitigate future instances it would be justified or if they are likely to abuse their children or not be able to support them economically then that would also be a possible justification
socialism,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrqreudpuklm
socialism,removed,thought that some people would actually work
socialism,removed,i dont think any of us will ever experience the weight of tradition duty and history felt by the monarch sure she could refuse to say those words but she would be disregarding hundreds of years of history in doing so the same history that saw power wrenched from the hands of the very same monarchy and grasped by the hands of the people
socialism,removed,i havent once defended the crown im simply trying to get people to apply their ire to a more appropriate target the government the queen isnt advocating austerity and isnt telling anyone to live with their means the queen isnt fucking the poor and the disabled the queen isnt grinding away at the nhs and the bbc that would be the government
socialism,removed,racism is bad yo
socialism,removed,yeah he won fair and square except if you vote the other way you lose your government job and public assistance not matter what happens maduro will win every election unless people want to lose their state owned jobs glorious state socialism show proof you voted the right way or lose your job left is not allowed to play by the rules left engages in violence all the time the right is far more hated in the west than the left
socialism,removed,your talking about the cold war us did not create wahhabism anyone who kills commies is a hero trump is going to give free helicopter rides to all communists dont worry bring your kids too
socialism,removed,youre delusional
socialism,removed,but yeah its definitely a bad thing
socialism,removed,how the hell can you be left and support putin because crazy people on both sides are immune to things like cognitive dissonance they arent actively caring about what they support only they care about what it is they hate thats how they define themselves its all about the clickslikesfavoritesretweetsreblogs and the benjamins baby
socialism,removed,thats just a picture of a kid outside a bombed building
socialism,removed,ah yes put the ethnic minority in charge
socialism,removed,is this a gulag or constration camp i need to knopw whether i am outraged or not
socialism,removed,and on the liberal side of things it goes a little like did the cop kill a white guy or a poc i need to know if im outraged
socialism,removed,fuck slacks
socialism,removed,the first one god knows liberals dont get mad when a white person is killed
socialism,removed,thats strange you would think if socialism was a viable way to run a country then there would be at least one prospering socialist country
socialism,removed,ah when a post from this sub pops up on my rall feed i just slowly shake my head at you braindamaged bastards
socialism,removed,there idealogy could be founded on farting rainbows it doesnt mean they arent going to wake up with a machete in them
socialism,removed,why wouldnt you want really intelligent savvy businesspeople as advisors elon musk runs a privately funded space program how is that not a good cv im not even sure that wrestling lady is a total dumbass the wwe is theater for teenage meatheads but its well run i think the point is that trump is definitely not a socialist so he wont be selecting people who espouse those ideals i am scared of the religious appointees i am more scared of them than probably anything about this whole mess
socialism,removed,is there a way to filter out you commie retards on rall or do i have to always stumble across this shit i get it your edgy and cool also half of those texts on your recommended reading are from murdering douche nozzles and the other half can thank their success to capitalism
socialism,removed,yeah its been awhile since socialists had a real shot at taking over the world hasnt looked this good for you guys since
socialism,removed,friendly reminder the cultural revolution killed million people and wiped out the entire tibetan buddhist culture that was agrarian and nomadic
socialism,removed,haha thats a made up thing i like actual handicapped people its the ones who choose the handicap like you guys that i hate
socialism,removed,how is socialism more free than free market capitalism
socialism,removed,communism is ideal in small groups of people or so it is unscalable it requires too much humanity and too much trust it is not possible to scale i live in pretty communally where about of my food and all of my energy and water is provided from inside the commune this is a commune of around people that are pretty homogenous with similar quaker values imagine trying to instill this in an entire heterogenous culture its is impossible it is naive there is no possible basis for trust our biology cannot even remember faces at a time
socialism,removed,i understand the difference between heckling a handicapped person with it and calling you a retard they are separate in meaning by context also it means you are choosing to be retarded do i need to explain that further
socialism,removed,hey shit thats naive
socialism,removed,well they found a way to get the donald off so maybe they can get you arm chair political scientists off too
socialism,removed,anarchist communism is cool but you will never convince me that abolishing private property is a good idea private property is up there with democracy as one of the best anthological ideas in human history i actually working on correlating poverty and houses that being rented by a tenant in postindustrial cities in upstate ny it is looking like neighborhoods that are not owned by people living in the neighborhoods are the most dangerous places up here its not a matter of race religion povertylevel education the major factors seem to me be home ownership and parental involvement i am open minded but not so much on no private property
socialism,removed,by being so stupid as to buy into any ism that pushes mao as recommended reading
socialism,removed,i agree with most of that well written response there are a crap load of flaws in capitalism for sure there are tons of rules and boundaries that would make it run much better like you said all of that being said i would still want to live in a mostly capitalist state the innovation and wealth created is unmatched by other forms of government
socialism,removed,communism collapsed first i win
socialism,removed,all muslims should be exterminated
socialism,removed,turns out a bunch of twerps with che shirts just want a big strong man to hoist em up in their arms and tell them that their status quo is the ultimate oppressor as a result a lot of the antiestablishment on the right and left have this weird love affair with putin
socialism,removed,not if they are a murderous piece of shit i bet you think hitler is great too
socialism,removed,i mean the community voluntarily decided they wanted a subreddit that doesnt include that type of language did they it seems like something the mods decided on and arbitrarily enforce how about let comments with words like idiot or moron stay and the community can choose to downvote them if they dont want that here
socialism,removed,what does this have to do with economic policy im with you lets stay out of the middle east but socialist countries go to war plenty too both systems are guilty
socialism,removed,mind telling me where im going wrong i mean there are a lot of other places i could have taken that unless sarcasm is in the list of nonos on the sidebar or go fuck yourself
socialism,removed,of course the timing of this post and absence of similar successful posts before is itself campism
socialism,removed,as someone with a long history of mental illness including full psychoses i strongly disagree with rlatestagecapitalisms ban on insane and crazy its a big turn off do we do it here too
socialism,removed,youre a fucking retard what the fuck do you know know about assad or syria that you havent learned in the last seconds even if you were syrian id still shit down your back
socialism,removed,damn youre ugly •geralt of rivia witcher
socialism,removed,of course their motive is to profit same as the employee why else would you go to work for cookies
socialism,removed,im pretty sure the mods here would have a meltdown if they worked on a building site this isnt a building site though its a community for socialists if we really do care about dismantling oppressive hierarchies we must hold ourselves to a higher standard
socialism,removed,by using those terms youre comparing someone to a disabled person and saying youre bad because youre like that disabled person
socialism,removed,what part of this building screams hospital to you
socialism,removed,debate is healthy i like to argue im not unreasonable and not a troll i just am not convinced of the socialist dogma
socialism,removed,this sub is giving me cancer i cant read on
socialism,removed,whats wrong with nazism
socialism,removed,ableism and banning people for it was a mistake a lot of bourgeoisie can be stupd this is seriously killing us in normal workers eyes
socialism,removed,maybe not letting douche bags rub the chat not all but whoever i talked to was a total ass
socialism,removed,i agree fellow comrade we must band together to rebuild the glorious soviet union and rid ourselves of the vile capitalist dogs
socialism,removed,hitler was a socialist
socialism,removed,i dont care either way the dumb sand niggers are getting whats coming to them
socialism,removed,controversial opinion here i understand the need to ban on socialism reddit for practical reasons to stop trolls but i support free speech especially irl i have this mindset about most things dont force things one way encourage it i am antireligious but i would not ban religion it is far more effective to have a secular government discouraging religion than an outright ban for example
socialism,removed,trump isnt even in office yet and hes already a dictator
socialism,removed,none he is neither fascist nor a white supremacist how difficult is it to understand
socialism,removed,mein kompf
socialism,removed,is this really where we are culturally refusing to study and learn isnt differently abled i wish there was a word i could use for this policy but theyd all get me banned
socialism,removed,you know it
socialism,removed,to be frank it felt like they focused way too much on microaggressions and not nearly enough on getting women maternity leave birth control etc i guess i kinda get more into the policy oriented issues because it feels like something objective can be done about it i also think pure conjecture on my part that if we had way better policy regarding women a lot of the microaggression stuff wouldnt be an issue women if i understand correctly get hit disproportionately harder by poverty related things
socialism,removed,everyone i dont like is a nazi
socialism,removed,thats unfortunate this is definitely a message that needs to get out there however controversial when it comes to todays society the worst part for me is that it is getting the coverage under the guise of the altright which will make people immediately dismiss its merit
socialism,removed,fuck off fascism isnt socialism
socialism,removed,you dont think men face inequalities in the united states or around the world for that matter the issue is hardly talked about due to social stigmas when it comes to males
socialism,removed,i guess you didnt send in your dick pic to mod rthefempill
socialism,removed,everybody knows that rights are a zero sum gain me so mad seriously though their thinking is fucked up antifeminist antihumanist antigenerallydecenthumanbeing as a dad those people make me very angry
socialism,removed,again youre here to complain not to find out what the words are and adjust your attitude weve linked to lists in the original post and if it were clarification you were asking for then you would have im here to complain because the attitude that its acceptable to alter the words of our opponents is a dangerous slope to ride that leads to bad places just post what they said and say we dont agree with the words they use but this is what they said if youre going to bring them up in discussion especially linking directly to their content it leads to shit like this httpsiimgurcommkadyrlpng anyway you said you were done with sub bye yeah once there are no more comments to defend my position from im out
socialism,removed,zomg
socialism,removed,im glad socialist circles off the internet arent as embarrassing and ridiculous as this place
socialism,removed,reading engels well theres your problem real marxists like those who run and frequent this subreddit dont need to read anything about marxism or socialism because after all its just the logical conclusion of liberal progressivism rather than a completely different mode of critical thought s
socialism,removed,jerald of rivia is a wise crossdresser
socialism,removed,true but under socialism it would be worker run not government so in its own way private
socialism,removed,it is censorship in this forum alone but thats as far as it goes because this forum is niched and not a general public forum for everyone to join in on technically its only meant for socialists theres not a problem with doing what we are doing
socialism,removed,this is what all government welfare looks like you tools a pit full of other peoples money
socialism,removed,in their defense they have been pursuing productive stuff and we wouldnt have what we have without them of course its important to keep an eye on them so they dont become the kind of villains we dont want here
socialism,removed,who kills the other
socialism,removed,you forgot to mention that black males being of the total population commit the majority of all violent crime your source
socialism,removed,and they kill white people at a rate of times more than whites killing blacks
socialism,removed,trillion spent on social welfare programs since lbjs great society and you sjws are still making up excuses for blacks in america
socialism,removed,a common misconception of the tpp is that it will create an international tribunal between corporations and governments but unfortunately that was created a long time ago rather the tpp would allow for the tribunal to be stacked to make it nearly impossible for governments to win against the corporations by having a majority of arbitrators come from the corporate sector really governments win more isds disputes than corporations each dispute has an arbitrator chosen by the government and one chosen by the investor those two choosed the third so arbitrators represent governments and investors in exactly even ratio
socialism,removed,why are we opposing tpp
socialism,removed,opposing tpp is labor aristocratic chauvinism not socialism
socialism,removed,exactly this is pure labor aristocracy nonsense
socialism,removed,us unions and workers have being transferred to vietnam et al would make a negligible dent in their lack of wealth source
socialism,removed,the vast majority of what american workers lose is going to the capitalist class not the vietnamese working class no one denied that
socialism,removed,i understand im just saying if it were the economist or some such publication i might take the time in spite of scaremongering on the left the deal does not obviously exalt the interests of big business over those of lowly consumers for instance under pressure from australia chile and peru america shelved its demand that certain drugs be protected from generic competition for at least years settling for five instead in the same vein tpps disputesettlement mechanism explicitly bars tobacco firms from claiming compensation for publichealth rules that harm their business to mollify unions and other likely opponents in richer countries several of tpps chapters are devoted to protections for workers and environmental safeguards there are clauses that attempt to slow deforestation and overfishing all parties will also be compelled to follow the international labour organisations basic principles on workers rights they will be required to set a minimum wage and regulate working hours vietnam will have to allow unions independent of the communist party such commitments will be enforceable under the treatys disputesettlement mechanism the greatest impact will be felt not in america but in the less developed members the study estimates that vietnamese gdp could rise by as much as an additional over the same period in short its a trade deal which will force at least a modicum of basic labour protections on some of the worst labour markets in the world the labour and environmental rights sections are well worth a read and are likely to lead to step changes in equitable practice in many developing nations further it will allow us to sue foreign competitors who gain an edge by failing to maintain adequate environmental or labour protections
socialism,removed,thats a funny way of saying i cant back up what ive said with actual evidence
socialism,removed,whats this got to do with socialism socialists cant be racist
socialism,removed,fascism is a very particular form of mental illness imho i am not a psychologist so grain of salt lack of empathy desire to manipulate inclination to violence to further ones agenda
socialism,removed,yeah its wonderful to actually have freedom of speech being able to actually buy food being able to leave the country freely not being jailed for your political views not being spyed on and having a fast growing economy that is constantly stamping down on corruption so yes it is better since the ussr
socialism,removed,xpost referenced from rcommunists by ugodyssey i am a bot i delete my negative comments httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetooriginalpostsearcher httpsgithubcompapernotesredditoriginalpostsearcher httpsgithubcompapernotesredditoriginalpostsearcherfaq
socialism,removed,capitalism works socialism doesnt sorry
socialism,removed,i usually disagree with the people in this sub reddit about everything i just wanted to say its awesome that many of you are pretty rational on guns what you all would call the bourgeoisie i would call the governmentbut it seems theres a general understand that you cant disarm the populace because the reason they need to own guns is to fend off people that are more powerful than them
socialism,removed,because if ever you grow up youll realize that essential truth
socialism,removed,what if you arent a muslim do they ban you from there or do they not allow you to eat during their religious festival season i question how tolerant and inclusive they really are
socialism,removed,very good honestly the left needs to move beyond culture wars bs and accept the fact that millions of working class people celebrate july
socialism,removed,why not let the republicans have their convention unmolested as well as the democrats does freedom of political speech go against socialism
socialism,removed,they dont preach either where did he preach racial supremacy exactly when he said that illegal immigrants have to go back and through the proper legal channels when he said mexico isnt sending its best in women sneaking into the us has been sexually assaulted on the way they arent sending their best fuck free speech if it isnt in your favour am i right
socialism,removed,lol thats it he made a couple offhand remarks and questioned obamas legitimacy so he has done the same as hillary clinton with her racist jokes and questioning of obama during the last election hopefully trump will win and get shills like her out of office
socialism,removed,didnt malcolm x renounce violence later in his life
socialism,removed,what does this have to do with socialism and since when were racists ever afraid of physical violence dae hate drumpf
socialism,removed,be socialist sub upvote image macro about a guy who wanted to free niggers for economic reasons right next to the image macro is an image of a man who hated niggers and actually executed them
socialism,removed,nigger
socialism,removed,nigger
socialism,removed,nigger
socialism,removed,nigger
socialism,removed,socialism is economy based and ownership and privatization literally has zero to do with race thats like saying capitalism is an advocate for social justice you can shoehorn whatever you want in to make it fit but it doesnt work
socialism,removed,if a black man wants to be your ally just ask him what he thinks of malcolm x
socialism,removed,hey cool we hate white people here now and not just capitalism good job guys really bringing it home
socialism,removed,so john brown was a pretty cool guy for sure but are the people in this sub actually serious with their allusions to a modernday armed rebellion
socialism,removed,how my hopeless kulak mind is confused
socialism,removed,no such thing but if there was theyd both be rotting in hell
socialism,removed,john brown is having a decent year although i think larry fitzgerald is producing more numbers but the only person i trust on the cardinals is david johnson dude is a beast
socialism,removed,ie blacks will only accept you if youre white if you murder other whites for them good to know
socialism,removed,how so very thedonald of you fucktard im out
socialism,removed,no as it is a deeply flawed economic and political philosophy
socialism,removed,how exactly is this different from the millions of hitler supporters and all the north koreans who cried out when kim jong il died it isnt different but you guys will still demonize hitler and kim jong il but praise castro because he is a socialist fucking morons
socialism,removed,and family members of cubans who have been hurt tortured and forced into a shitty life by castro
socialism,removed,youre really think castro deserves a place in heaven if it exists
socialism,removed,as a portlander who has closely been following the protests this article has no grasp on the realities of the protests police have been doing an excellent job by most accounts and have done their best considering the situation
socialism,removed,that was awesome someone needs to make a version with cartoon sound effects
socialism,removed,its been rumored that this man is autistic a hillary supporter and was upset at the disruption being caused while he was trying to concentrate on studies im not sure how accurate it is but having done some volunteer work with mentally disabled people when i was younger i strongly suspect at least the first point is accurate
socialism,removed,just saying the nazi party is socialist
socialism,removed,its still socialism it just isnt marxist socialism
socialism,removed,if its true that he has a mental health disorder than it might be a little presumptive to label him a fascist with so little information available
socialism,removed,there is no evidence that this man is a fascist if you have some please provide it
socialism,removed,well you can mean whatever you like i was addressing what you actually said as for acting like a fascist ill simply say that im quite happy there are people in this world who understand asd and have the compassion required try and help people who suffer with it wed be in a pretty disgusting situation if it were filled with people like you
socialism,removed,what i actually said was being a fascist he was being a fascist autistic or not ummm whether or not hes autistic is rather important as to whether or not hes being a fascist people who may have mental handicaps which prevent them from reacting appropriately to certain social situations do not necessarily understand their actions in the way that would be required to be anything other than someone who does not appropriately handle certain social situations im on the autism spectrum and so are some of my friends who are leftist im sure many would tell you to go fuck yourself with your patronizing attitude we can have opinions and do shitty things and be held responsible for our actions as soon as you have evidence of what this mans opinions are then you may have an argument for this case youve provided no such evidence to attempt to dodge the fact that you have no fucking idea what this mans opinions are by appealing to your own disability is the only thing thats patronizing here im criticizing this dude for his violent actions against comrades for which you have zero evidence were informedspurred on by any opinions let alone evidence as to what his opinions are not criticizing whatever disorder he may or may not have all i have pointed out is that there is a fairly obvious and simple explanation for the behavior which he demonstrated but maybe you cant see past the disorder as soon as you provide evidence that would supplant occams razor im happy to take his opinions and how they influence his actions into account until then forgive me if i dont bother to respond to any more of your disgusting attempts to label this person as a fascist for what may be a result of behavioraldevelopmental issues
socialism,removed,whats the evidence for him being autistic frankly im not convinced he is autistic the first time i saw the video before hearing from others i actually suspected trisomy but there can be a number of similar physicalvocal features that are easily mistaken with full blown autism what im fairly confident about is that he has some sort of developmental disability what precisely is not really my concern there have also been multiple statements around the net by people who claim to be more familiar with him who said he suffers from autism looks like you also responded to an osu thread on the issue where several people have said such so you obviously know what im referring to he just screams you idiot and pushes someone down a flight of stairs yes people with mental disabilities are capable of doing that thats evidence of assault not autism im not claiming that his words or the act of pushing someone down the stairs is evidence of autism what i am saying is that having worked with people previously who suffer from developmental disorders the video provides enough visual and audio cues that i believe this to be the case for him trump supporters might have started the rumor about him being autistic to excuse the violent act sure and socialists may have started the rumor hes a fascist whats your point
socialism,removed,literally lol thanks for sharing thats the best thing ive seen all day we should all find a stupid hipster today to push down some stairs
socialism,removed,because leftists are lazy and annoying and only really know how to alienate the average person
socialism,removed,not reactionary just a leftist who sees the actual problems plaguing the left
socialism,removed,among others but by all means lets learn absolutely nothing from this election and just continue blaming the right for our own incompetence thats worked so well up til now
socialism,removed,maybe ive more or less given up on the left ever accomplishing anything meaningful to be honest my desperate hope now is that the more philanthropic of the technocrats will unite and work some kind of magic to ease the enormous suffering thats coming our way if they dont deliver something pretty amazing were all fucked
socialism,removed,well see i guess
socialism,removed,not if we continue to alienate the average voter with obnoxious ivory tower rhetoric that will likely result in a working class that simply doesnt engage with the democratic process and then we will really be in trouble
socialism,removed,and we need it yesterday
socialism,removed,yes and it appears to have galvanised the left to some extent which is encouraging whether that change will be broad enough and deep enough to turn the tides remains to be seen
socialism,removed,by crawling into your sjw commie safe spaces and banning sending to gulag anyone who opposes or criticizes your bullshit youre not changing shit faggot stalin and lenin arent coming back once you get out of your safe space you might get it or better move to china or north korea those places are pure heaven i hear fuck you faggot
socialism,removed,raznidentity does indeed has a problem with their altright attitude and im in no way defending of that but on a post about half of foreigners wanting to leave thailand good get the fuck out yes racists leaving the country is good riddance are hardly socialist dont you think how very socialist of you says the guy who claimed to be marxist but denying himself a communist advocating for liberal democracy
socialism,removed,do you want socialists to achieve anything ever the message of socialism is that everyone is equal and the socialist movement has always been about class i dont thing anyone is talking about abandoning support for lgbt or other minority causes only that we need to move on and actually be inclusive to the majority it has been increasingly common to use white man as a slur within the left that is fucking retarded in a mostly white country socialism has to be a mass movement of the people not just a home for angry outsiders
socialism,removed,upseudojewboy
socialism,removed,they shouldnt be his policies resulted in the deaths of millions
socialism,removed,i call bullshit
socialism,removed,why again havent we nuked that wrecked state already them and florida would solve of our problems if they were gone
socialism,removed,is this thread a joke the homeless get two meals a day at shelters they get plenty of food
socialism,removed,i live in houston dont care about the homeless
socialism,removed,although mao has passed his cult of personality survives
socialism,removed,imo this was a fucking stupid move on his part potentially giving legitimacy to something that was up until now obviously a bullshit conspiracy theory that only paranoid white supremacists talked about no one intelligent or significant dignified it with discussion even jokingly now even though there obviously still isnt a white genocide happening in the united states and the overwhelming majority of people will be smart enough to know that fascists will have something to point to when they want to say that the radical altleft yes theyre actually using that phrase to describe us now has gotten out of control and must be stopped and that liberals will listen to
socialism,removed,the lazy who will rely on others generosity happens a lot in the bay area you see year old kids with sign
socialism,removed,ive seen srebrenica i cannot in good conscience support anyone calling for genocide downvote away
socialism,removed,i understand the joke he was trying to make but honestly what was he hoping to achieve was he just trying to troll neonazis many people wont understand the reference he is making and will take it at face value at which point it becomes incredibly offensive it seems rash and unbecoming of a professor to tweet this sort of thing
socialism,removed,words can be impactful even outside of their intended meaning people on this sub of all places should know that after the recent discussions about being more cautious with our use of language tweeting something that can be interpreted to be advocating mass murder is not ok and should not be supported
socialism,removed,some people really get butthurt about tame jokes oh sorry was that homophobic
socialism,removed,yup this is our liberal ruling elite in houston that pushed for this i wish that was sarcasm
socialism,removed,ok bud whatever works for you and is to be seen purely in the dialectic frame i grew up under socialism party history and marxist dialectic was required i am part of the proletariat i will not support anyone calling for genocite under any shape color or form
socialism,removed,rationalizations arent rational either
socialism,removed,so there are a number of good reasons why this happens in houston to start most of the homeless population arent actually homeless theyre grifters beggars and panhandlers who probably do better than most of us around the corner from my last job sits a number of people who ask for money all day one of them lives in a bedroom town house nicer than where i live they take the food even though they are often on some form of welfare or takin in and still take food and resources for those who need it then theres the trash the massive and immense amount of trash everytime food is handed out the individuals receiving the food just throw what they have in the street and on the ground then we have to spend tax money to clean up this mess then theres the poo due to most of these individuals being fed on the street there are not the appropriate facilities at hand to accomodate what often happens after we eat we poo so in the past there have been numerous individuals who choose to defecate out in public that adds a whole other level of difficulty we have places for the homeless to go countless centers and facilities where there is help the real homeless go there and get what they need these arent homeless theyre lazy bums who are just looking for a handout
socialism,removed,i can rest easy seeing this but honestly what an idiotic tweet especially in this political climate how do umynamenospaces suggest we contact drexel
socialism,removed,socialism is about helping people providing a social blanket we have those opportunities but everybody here is too entrenched in their sounding board rather than help provide support to the social systems that are already in place we have food banks and food kitchens and ample places for individuals go to and get food we have a free food bank that many are elligible for these are not homeless who need help theyre bums who need a kick in the but to get off their ass none of them have the typical homeless issues theyre just too lazy to work and its not blankets and pillows most end up just giving cash houston doesnt get cold theres no need for blankets and pillows and what is given just ends up polluting the city and we have to spend money cleaning it up these arent homeless theyre street people
socialism,removed,this is a hallmark of socialism why arent you guys for this i came from a socialist country and we were taught to do this even in school
socialism,removed,thanks sadly like most of our country these people live their sheltered lives in their suburban utopia where nothing ever goes wrong id love to see them actually interact with some of these people have someone come at you with a knife while you walk down the streets and the cops just dont care or where the homeless break into the home next door shit everywhere and then it doesnt sell for months due to the massive cost of cleaning it up sadly people are too worked up about making their own self feel good rather than actually helping cbs sunday morning did a great expose piece httpwwwcbsnewscomnewswhendisasterreliefbringsanythingbutrelief it goes on to talk about how people are too focused on making themselves feel good about helping rather than actually helping
socialism,removed,some homeless people dont want to change thats probably where this mentality comes from
socialism,removed,i was working as a contractor for the townhome complex where she lives having worked in that neighborhood for a few years ive seen her and her friends quite a bit she lives in the same unit layout my former roomate owned its an older townhome but still decent had to run one of them off more than once when they try to wash my windshield then demand money or start hitting the vehicle one of her street friends often comes into the strip club we go to from time to time nothing like seeing him whip out a massive role of cash and drop a few hundred on lap dances and booze dig around the houston chronicle theres years worth of writeups on the panhandlers who get caught with nice apartments cars and decent incomes solely from sitting on corners collecting donations
socialism,removed,the law isnt literally dont feed the homeless the law that prevented the group from doing what they were doing is more of a sanitary protection while it is all for charity its kind of volatile having people with no food handling permitlicense handing out food to a ton of humans who cant get much help if they suddenly get sick
socialism,removed,its about transforming the social relations involved in production in order to bring about change in the material conditions of the working class the original socialist manifesto from france was about redistribution of wealth among all peoples forming self sustained social infrastructures by definition a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production distribution and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole has nothing to do with the working class thats an evolution of socialism into the century the city has no interest whatsoever in long term solutions we do we have numerous programs to help get these people off the street or at least off of street corners do you live here do you vote for these city council members do you actively help these organizations so until a situation arises when we can establish a workingclass government as usual it turns from a small social issue to government goddamed bleeding heart bullshit
socialism,removed,were the homeless fined
socialism,removed,he said the massacre of whites in the hatian revolution was a good thing he literally said hes happy white children were butchered because of the crimes of their parents
socialism,removed,he said the massacre of whites in haiti was a good thing the massacre involved killing thousands of white children white and mixed race people who were antislavery and forcing white women into marriages with black rebels at the threat of death
socialism,removed,women and children were generally killed last white women were often raped or pushed into forced marriages under threat of death he supported the murder and rape of white women and children based entirely on their race hes a scumbag and if you defend him then just admit you see whites as subhuman
socialism,removed,ok so killing children is ok if their parents are evil fucking hell listen to yourself
socialism,removed,you are really making this out way bigger than it is this isn´t the no fun zone you know oh and about that butthurt joke i am bisexual for fucks sake i can decide for myself what offends me thanks
socialism,removed,i dont expect any replies as most of you will be dead from starvation also you wouldnt be able to reply to me as modern internet capable devices and the internet in general are capitalist inventions
socialism,removed,kinda like hollywood actors and other rich people many if not most of them actors are liberals no moving to expensive gated properties is hardly politically motivated or onesided its a personal choice of separation from whatever you dont want onnear your property look at some of the politicians for example regardless of party affiliation you have many who also live on expensive gated propertiesthe reason is the exact same in no way am i rich or even to be considered well off currently heres to hard work and luck but along with the homeless and anyone else whos not a personal friend relative or invitee from those living on said types of properties if they wanted us there theyd invite us its not that they have some chart of income levels of whom is an acceptable to include and whos not cant make it about money or politics its personal choice and that supersedes any opinion i or anyone else may have or why people choose to live in those if i was ever to become well off or even rich id find a nice average home in an average city gut it save one interior wall and then remodel and make it into something very nice sturdy safe n cozy to use money on expensive properties creates many problems i dont want a small one of which is people assuming that i hate anyone and thats why i live like that safety stability and comfort are my goals in a home
socialism,removed,while there is a moral arguement to be made i dont necessarily think you can blame policemen when they follows orders afterall he is just doing his job to make sure he doesnt end up homeless like the people he is punishing most people choose to work for the police force because they want to help people not because they like bullying homeless people you dont blame coal miners who keep working for the coal industry despite the immense pollution that industry create
socialism,removed,emotional oversimplification is like reddits calling card now
socialism,removed,should anyone celebrate this man who killed thousands and thousands
socialism,removed,have you been out on the streets in that area i doubt it while i on the other hand live there in fact i live blocks from the intersection where the event happened nobody is handing out pillows and blankets its mostly half eaten food and money
socialism,removed,this guy has a history of posting stuff like this though so im skeptical of the satire claim some newssites are reporting that he also praised the ethnic cleansing that occurred during and after the haitian revolution
socialism,removed,you know the difference between socialism and capitalism isnt how much heart you have right socialist systems shift economic control and responsibility to the community from private individuals but that doesnt mean the economy and necessity for contribution no longer exists the community still governs how much individuals contribute to the general welfare of everyone what i imagine youre failing to see is just how limited resources are and that there are needy people who deserve surplus resources far more than those leeching from cities do
socialism,removed,petition to support someone who supports white genocide nice
socialism,removed,im from houston theres more to the story than this
socialism,removed,they dont support the professor
socialism,removed,food waste disposal and water are largely available for free already housing is where youre wrong housing is both not free or easy to provide even with significant government subsidies vouchers and shelters already exist in places like houston the problem thats frequently overlooked by journalists seeking to write quickandeasy feel good articles is that public health professionals and governments are working to help people living on the street theyve consistently found and legislated that given the free resources to the homeless enables their very dangerous and selfdestructive lifestyle and prevents them from seeking help from the professionalcharitable institutions already in place would you give a free meal to a homeless person if you had inside knowledge that they previously refused a meal from a shelter because the shelter was insisting they meet with a mental health professional or seek treatment for drug issues
socialism,removed,doesnt this violate our antiableist policy s
socialism,removed,i joke about murdered black people with bazooka and machine guns yet im the bad guy you guys are shit fucking hypocrites all of you
socialism,removed,what did he do very interested in that tbh did he correctly predict that the miserable failure of socialist economics would finally come due once oil prices fell and the venezuelans couldnt rely on exports to the evil west
socialism,removed,because theyre not supporting the professor
socialism,removed,ah so i should buy any anticity story related to this because there have been previous issues that is not how things work there have been tons of abuses by police but i dont assume every cop is bad when a shooting occurs youre basically saying youll forever be a contrarian whether there is proof or not thats a shitty way to live and definitely not something you should feel so righteous about
socialism,removed,praying for a lynching this black friday im joking you really think this would fly the opposite way round he mocked the massacre of over white and mixed race people many women and children and many sympathetic and friendly to black haitians and his twitter is a hive of virulent anti white sentiments i might lean left economically but people defending this blatant racist is why i will never identify with the current socialist movement
socialism,removed,what i know is putin will be in gulag under stalin for sure
socialism,removed,one comment thread on a facebook post racist outrage apparently this is genuine rkotakuinaction material and you people should be embarrassed for perpetuating it
socialism,removed,literally hitler
socialism,removed,are you another racist person who thinks all arab people are terrorists this sub is full of pathetic whiny idiots no wonder socialism has such a terrible image atm if you twats are the ones pushing it youre the biggest advertisement against it stop focusing on bullshit and focus on things that actually matter youre so fucked youre a north korea apologist you have no right to say shit to anyone you dictatorloving psycho
socialism,removed,im mad when injected yourself into a conversation that didnt involve you by telling me to fuck off the lack of selfawareness and low level of argument displayed by some of you in this sub is astounding youre like teenagers trying to be edgy but whats sad is that youre likely overweight adults with very poor social skills
socialism,removed,he looks tall enough to ride with pinochet
socialism,removed,i agree with you completely but i dont think its modern socialism youre having trouble with its just this sub ive read several posts here lately where literally the first sentence was im a genderfluid white man and who gives a fuck what youre identifying as i will treat anyone as equal no matter what race religion or sexual orientation he has it is of absolutely relevance to me as what youre identifying yourself as and this is a sub for socialism for crying out loud i think equality of all sexualities is an important issue but please post this somewhere else its not relevant to socialism im not sure perhaps this is just an age thing a lot of people on here might just be yo and have no idea what theyre talking about i got called a wasp by someone a few months back and i couldnt hold back a laugh when i googled the term it just seemed so ridiculous a few months back there was a post where a christian asked if he could be a socialist when he had religious believes he got absolutely shredded its ironic to see the people who constantly cry about perceived intolerance to be incredibly intolerant towards people who are not thinking what theyre thinking its just a shame for this sub really
socialism,removed,because socialists know the working class so well unlike the out of touch liberal elite thats why they write clever comics with the word dumb censored i mean for fucks sake its not even censored you can see the letter behind the x i know someone said this comic was edited after it was made but the irony of censoring the word dumb on the same panel as someone not understanding the working class boggles my mind in case anyone forgot or didnt listen originally some of the best most biting leftist punk rock songs contain words like niggers uncensored if socialists cant figure out the underlying reason why socialism will be a joke to the average person hint the reason isnt that people want the right to hurl racist slurs at each other thats not my point
socialism,removed,as much as i hate trump and i truly do kicking and screaming and marching down the street with signs will ultimately do nothing he is still doing to become president protests can lead to violence if you are not careful and people can get hurt and you can hurt your community and for what in all reality nothing is going to change that is just the sad truth of it
socialism,removed,people who own companies have an interest in managing them well and central planning enthusiasts dont planners dont have an interest in ensuring that the populace has what is needed to ensure a good standard of living who would run this company the planners would most likely be selected in accordance to a meritocratic system where they prove their knowledge of economics social systems the organization of society and what is needed to ensure that the country can continue to prevail companies have a clear measure of success profit and stock value and planners have one too ensuring economics growth and that everyone has access to the materials and services needed for a high standard of living i just thought id respond to this for the giggles
socialism,removed,the adl seems somewhat antiarab palestinian possibly zionist
socialism,removed,a socialism is something beyond marxs terminology where its not even a separate thing from communism i wish more selfproclaimed marxists knew that we dont have a monopoly on what isisnt socialism b you dont get upvotes by being harshly polemical against adored figures be it legit understanding of his theory or just babys first leftist on any subreddit
socialism,removed,and heres simple picture that shows what socialism brings
socialism,removed,after this week i want a space gulag so much
socialism,removed,wew lad
socialism,removed,sure sounds like youre all organizing a terrorist attack against our president elect i will be forwarding this to the fbi and dhs
socialism,removed,if you think being violent or blocking roads while protesting is a good idea youre gonna have a bad time
socialism,removed,the electoral college is amazing only when it works for you i see
socialism,removed,sure they got rid of the parasitic capitalistic class and replaced it with a new parasitic bureaucratic class progress
socialism,removed,and slave camps
socialism,removed,chomsky never defended the khmer rouge get your facts straight before repeating a slur contains a breif history of that odious lie of course if you still think im wrong please provide a single qoute from chomsky himself defending the khmer rouge shouldnt be hard if he was actively defending as you falsely claim
socialism,removed,good idea ive also seen calls for a general strike on inauguration day but this mornings news is all about antitrump protesters in portland messing up a car dealership etc wrong tactic even blocking traffic on the interstate is a bad move we need people to join us not to scorn us fear us and call us crybabies instead of riots we need a focused organized selfdisciplined movement the idea is to sugget a better alternative not just fuck shit up please share these points where yall can
socialism,removed,this whole thing is just a hysterical overreaction trump is not going to abolish freedom of the bourgeois press
socialism,removed,do people not have the responsibility to choose the candidate they feel would be less harmful to society or are you saying both are equally harmful if so why
socialism,removed,i dont think you understand what fascism means
socialism,removed,oh my fucking god really really people what are you protesting
socialism,removed,you implied that trump is a fascist
socialism,removed,because as someone who has actually studied history im sick of all these fools running around with their fascism checklist and they can break down such a complex issue into a few points when they actually have absolutely no understanding of what fascism actually is im on my phone so this would take way too long to explain but here is a good explanation
socialism,removed,ah your possessions are more important than a persons life got ys
socialism,removed,this will merely increase the rate of successful suicides
socialism,removed,he doesnt even remotely fit the description of a fascist trump isnt a nazi but hes walking that same road hahahaha im sure you can back this idiotic statement up with some facts nationalism is a long dark and scary path no its absolutely not you realize that being a nationalist a nazi and a fascist are three completely different things right
socialism,removed,since theyre americans theyre lives didnt matter christ get your head out of your ass man
socialism,removed,nationalism is an integral part of fascism dude and that doesnt mean that nationalism is fascist logic the fact that you think a wiki article and a shitty news blog proves your point shows me how little you actually know haha
socialism,removed,hahaha this is almost too good to be true you take the words of a single person out of context because you dont understand them and yet you think you can use that to prove your point if you actually had any education and knowledge of history you would know that the opinion of a single person can in no way be taken for fact
socialism,removed,funny considering you failed to provide a single argument and instead linked a wiki article thinking its an easy copout youre just an insecure child like the majority of his supporters ahh out of arguments better resort to childish insults haha but no im european and dont even like trump also seriously nationalism is the key component of fascism its like the number one box on the are you a real fascist check list theyre inherently correlated no its absolutely not nationalism is a part of fascism just as its a part of many other ideologies
socialism,removed,no making baseless assumptions and throwing around insults is not making an argument you state your personal opinion that his economic policies are fascist as fact without backing it up thats nothing else but shitposting so yeah all i see here is an insecure kid who is salty as fuck that trump became president you can stomp your feet and hold your breath all you want it doesnt change reality haha
socialism,removed,no it hasnt been spelled out you failed to make a single argument how his politics are fascist besides posting a wiki article ahh so i guess this is a safespace echo chamber sub where only circlejerking is allowed haha
socialism,removed,no it really does not describe his rise so i guess you really do not have any arguments of your own
socialism,removed,what is wrong with the things theyre going to do
socialism,removed,nit like i was sarcastic or anything or implying he wasnt a true socialist for believing that
socialism,removed,be careful everyone some other was reports of people attacking minorities were proven to be false in the end im not calling him a liar or anything and my heart goes out to those who face real discrimination but its also possible that this guy could have just pretended to have been beaten to death just take things with a grain of salt please
socialism,removed,yeah like the black guys that beat up a white guy for being a trump supporter
socialism,removed,no matter how much you dislike the candidates i still cant believe people try to say they were the same
socialism,removed,the only racists being more aggressive are clinton supporters this article was written november before trump was elected so i doubt it has anything to do with him
socialism,removed,it does when there isnt a ton of people without jobs that are willing i work cheap oh caught myself i was just basically outlining want an illegal is trump literally wants to give the average american worker more power but yall oppose him
socialism,removed,if you dont own the means of production youre working class anything else is a meaningless distinction to separate based on income
socialism,removed,yeah this will surly change the outcome
socialism,removed,sjw movement created trump newtons third law for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
socialism,removed,physics does dictate everything in the universe does it not you sound bitter
socialism,removed,lol good luck
socialism,removed,its pretty ignorant to think that laws of the universe dont apply to every aspect of the universe we humans are guilty of thinking we are greater than the insignificant specs that we are just like nature we too follow all the same rules even at the psychological level humanity is the most important thing to us but not to existence itself we are simply spec of dust in the wind nothing more nothing less
socialism,removed,if protest means taking a day off work to smoke pot than i am in
socialism,removed,use airplane mode so you still have a camera flashlight offline map etc
socialism,removed,protest or raise hell are you rioting or protesting
socialism,removed,yeah stick it to the man by asking his permission
socialism,removed,hours earlier prior to that its all chinese jets
socialism,removed,we must remove the pos from office
socialism,removed,you guys are like neonazis but on the left
socialism,removed,therefore the working class should never take the streets again
socialism,removed,hell i do that already most days
socialism,removed,you people are such nerds
socialism,removed,make it grow it build it be more narrow minded
socialism,removed,the implication being here that someone will so offended by these words that they cant stomach to watch them even when used to represent the narrow viewpoints of an enemy but apparently its presumed same people fit the dxmb description enough that they wont notice the word with a red x painted over it cringeworthy
socialism,removed,so why are u striking
socialism,removed,rbasicincome
socialism,removed,lol this sub has got the be the biggest group of fuckin losers on earth nobody in this sub will ever change anything just keep crying about how unfair the world is to you you big babies
socialism,removed,thats great news the best communist is a dead comunist you must be some happy
socialism,removed,this whole sub is so cute youre a bunch of cutie pies
socialism,removed,do you think you are actually going to turn anything around i guess as long as it makes you feel good
socialism,removed,uh oh tankie wave incoming get ready to get linked to left communisman infantile disorder and other classics
socialism,removed,please do not desecrate nerudas legacy by mixing him up with this liberal gender bs also stop disrespecting the hammer and sickle
socialism,removed,youre right comrade real socialist movements should be impotent detached from the working class and never i must repeat never have a successful revolution anything that goes further than a workers cooperative bakery is stalinist oppression s
socialism,removed,uhh bro im an ex tankie ive read all the sources i dont think theyre credible besides anarchists have been criticizing them wayyy before the red scare
socialism,removed,even that is arguable a socialist society would seek to eliminate the bourgeoisie entirely not by killing them hopefully anyway but by removing their privileges if the class doesnt exist we cant oppress it
socialism,removed,no socialism isnt inherently oppressive the means we use to abolish capitalism will cause the oppression of some individuals
socialism,removed,i think were approaching peak sectarianism is it really necessary to say x country wasntisnt socialist nothing to see here folks bee tee dubs fuck those tankies in every single thread
socialism,removed,marxism leninism is too authoritarian and puts too much power in the state we dont end up with communism either capitalism or revisionism
socialism,removed,well belittling them isnt a good way to start
socialism,removed,identitarian belonging is a trap op
socialism,removed,by providing far more for the world than most nearly all of us on this he doesnt deserve billions but thats the answer to your question
socialism,removed,says the highschooler you have absolutely no idea about the real world or business
socialism,removed,kill yourself nazi
socialism,removed,this is a complete straw man argument nationalism is about making a decision to distribute a limited amount of resources to a smaller group of people in germany for example bringing in refugees while good from an altruistic perspective is bad from a gdp growth perspective it takes money to bring a refugee from the point of requiring government funding to survive to the point where they can return a contribution back to society there is two sides to the coin and both sides are important but you need to balance short term and long term costs and benefits against the need to be altruistic the idea of saying nationalism is about love is simply not the argument most nationalist individuals use they argue on economics
socialism,removed,donald trump is arguing nationalism in the usa with these arguments a nation without borders is not a nation there must be a wall across the southern border a nation without laws is not a nation laws passed in accordance with our constitutional system of government must be enforced a nation that does not serve its own citizens is not a nation any immigration plan must improve jobs wages and security for all americans source httpswwwdonaldjtrumpcompositionsimmigrationreform another nationalist proponent would be boris johnson from the uk arguing in favor of the uk leaving the eu with the following argument what i want is to get out and then negotiate a series of trade arrangements around the world he says the advantage of a no vote is that it would jolt the whole system in europe for their own sake they need to look at the way they are doing things source now your turn to show me examples of someones different standards you probably wont be able to though but i look forward to seeing you fail or ignore this because facts are hard
socialism,removed,httprationalwikiorgwikiglobalresearch httprationalwikiorgwikiglobalresearch selected conspiracy theories supported by globalresearch chemtrails exist and are toxic or are for geoengineering fluoridation is poison genetically modified food is part of a plan to sterilize humanity or merely is toxic usa nuked iraq afghanistan usa created isis to use it as a psychological operations theater global warming is a conspiracy charlie hebdo was a false flag tldr make sure you salt that story before consuming it it might be bullshit
socialism,removed,socialism is one of the most fascist states other than communism the state literally takes your money and decides what to spend it on that is fascism you morons
socialism,removed,national socialism wasnt much different than marxistleninism neither were truly socialist but it is a point worth making
socialism,removed,fuck it lets go full poverty
socialism,removed,i have one please
socialism,removed,but how many dead venezuelans voted for maduro in his recent and very close election
socialism,removed,sure remove a major incentive for being productive and expect positive results absurd
socialism,removed,see i think islamophobia is bunch of bs also there are plenty of rational reasons to fear islamics but i wouldnt say i am islamophobic i am out right religionophobic except the phobic part is bs there are plenty of rational reasons to fear the religious the number one reason to fear the religious is because with out having them spell out each and every part they follow and the parts they dont then you can never know if theyre going to try to kill me just for identifying as an atheist that doesnt make me phobic it makes me pragmatic
socialism,removed,if you think that any of this money would go to relief its not its almost certainly just going to some government officials pocket
socialism,removed,youre referring to libertarian socialism aka anarchism i used the word in the context of libertarianism which wants smaller government less government control more freedoms i think the main difference between the two is the right can hold themselves up and dont need handouts and dont need anyone to tell us what to do or how to do it
socialism,removed,its okay theyll be against the occupation as soon as aipac gets outbid on it
socialism,removed,another piece in blm written by a white woman
socialism,removed,thanks for the response what made me think she is white is a google image search which shows she appears as the driven snow it was maybe a different woman even if she was white how would that be relevant at all uh yeah it totally would are you serious look i get the down votes and irrational hate but i fight the real fight and dont cow to circle jerk narratives
socialism,removed,with all respect how can this be a serious question should we take advisement about white supremacy from white people
socialism,removed,sigh why isnt it
socialism,removed,ive been bombarded by white women which isnt a surprise not even infuriating just saddening
socialism,removed,i would love for you to weigh in on this what about this do you sarcastically call enlightened
socialism,removed,most aboriginal people have a lighter skin colour ok you have no idea what you are talking about why are you even in this discussion
socialism,removed,do you have a link to a photo she looks white as a sheet from my search but maybe i found the wrong woman so if im wrong i would appreciate you showing me
socialism,removed,its funny that you call me racist considering that by current sociological definitions that is impossible as a first nations canadian you are arguing that ottoman slavery maintained a concept of personhood for slaves which is so ignorant i simply want you to research it google the arab slave trade which harmed many more millions than the american one yes turks arent arabs calm down in a ridiculously violent way
socialism,removed,well it has been my experience including this thread i acknowledge that you are asian but in this particular discussion im not sure why your voice should be specially heard you are an intruder on aboriginal land like all the rest are you not
socialism,removed,right i forgot this was a socialist sub its so rich that you call me a fascist when i have said nothing of the sort except to disrupt your feelings im full communist just not blind to reality
socialism,removed,thanks very much so you are saying that the white woman who comes up in a google search isnt even her do you have a link i mean that would change everything and i could simply apologize and abandon my argument here your sub is still deeply circle jerk though i couldnt change that opinion and i hope you realize that thanks
socialism,removed,as a nonwhite i defeat you on the progressive stack i care about blm especially as my closest friends are mostly black but you probably wouldnt know much about that blm as a movement has made many missteps not the least being rallies that call for killing cops this isnt the way
socialism,removed,im not a fan of any of those guys who would you consider an inspiring personality
socialism,removed,hi everyone just wanted to drop in and share that ive started a new political discussion that isnt controlled by correct the record httpswwwredditcomrfreepoldiscussion if anyone wants to help get this off the ground im sick of all the clear hillary bias from the modspaid shills of that sub
socialism,removed,tankies gonna tanki mean you look at the side bar where prominent socialist are shownthey have mao in the rotation
socialism,removed,you are delusional
socialism,removed,ssshhhhhh youre going to trigger the ussr apologists
socialism,removed,why are you ppl downvoting this comment ussr was a hell on earth
socialism,removed,lmao how is this downvoted i thought it was widely acknowledged that east germany was state capitalist
socialism,removed,you do realize that cops are actively placed in situations where killing somebody is much more likely than the average african american right your whole argument seems like a bad mashup of the suppressed evidence and red herring fallacies
socialism,removed,why the fuck are you banning ultraleft users im not a leftcom but this is fucking ridiculous leftcommunists are leftists as well
socialism,removed,lmao you fucking commies
socialism,removed,booo where am i going to post all my brocialist psychotic shit leftypol says now
socialism,removed,how is it doxxing if you willingly posted your picture to a public chat room
socialism,removed,poblacht posted a picture of himself in the public rsocialism discord which was then used as a basis for a meme on rultraleft
socialism,removed,it is not doxxing doxxing is accessing private information and posting it to a public forum poblacht posted a picture of himself to a public chatroom which was then used as the basis for a meme on rultraleft
socialism,removed,poblacht posted a picture of himself to the public rsocialism discord it was then used as the basis for a meme on rultraleft it isnt doxxing
socialism,removed,posting a picture of yourself to a public chatroom then having your face used as the basis for a meme is not doxxing as somebody who has had their information shared on fascist pages before and people actually ringing up my mother and shouting threatening things down the phone to her im pretty disgusted to see this considered doxxing
socialism,removed,from what sts they didnt dox any mod here and it had nothing to do with them they claim they are being banned because they made fun of trotskyists how true is this
socialism,removed,yes but according to the mods of the other subs they didnt dox anybody and sts had nothing to do with it
socialism,removed,can you post evidence of this as a frequent user of sts ive never seen a single brigading post ive never seen a single doxxing post where is this stuff happening is it really brigading to point out the brocialist transphobic genocide apologism and sheer psychopathy of some users and ideologies that often permeates farleft communities
socialism,removed,im not asking you to dox anyone im asking you to clarify what the hell happened according to everyone else this is just a vendetta against sls and youve been trying to get sls and sts shut down for a long time and that there was no doxxing event instead someone just posted a photo of an admin who publically posted his own photo on sls so why are those of us from sts being caught in the crossfire of this subs mod spat between a sub that has nothing to do with sts
socialism,removed,lol wut sls users actively calls for the murder sorry gulag of anarchists leftcoms and any other socialist tendancy that isnt fucking authoritarian leninism there are threads on sls right now shitting on anarchists and leftcoms they are more abusive than anyone else
socialism,removed,at least you seem to realize theres no logic behind it
socialism,removed,they dox people again where i visit sls all the time because its actually good to have discussion over some of the more henious views that pop up in the far left support of the eastern orthodox army support of assad support of the kim regime genocide apologia abuse of leftcoms and anarchists and i have never ever seen doxxing on that board nor brigading they harass users we ask them to stop they then stop for a day or so whilst insulting everyone for being a tankie or whatever and then start doing it again is it really harassment to point out some of the horrific shit that gets posted here on this board it wasnt that long ago there was a thread where users here were goading on a member to kill their upper class family in the coming revolution and not to do so would be reactionary or how about the support for an actual fascist government a government that officially views itself as third way because they are antiamerican there is plenty of horrific views that get posted to this board and sts is a sub where we discuss and make fun of these sadly common views among leftist communities its a toxic community people who participate in that community are then facilitating its existence we are right to not want such people here yet you allow the tankie psychopaths of sls who actively call for the gulag murder rape torture of anarchists leftcoms and other socialist tendencies yeah cool
socialism,removed,deservedly as evidenced by this necessary mod action
socialism,removed,i was banned from rpyongyang for point out that nk isnt actually socialist but a mix of cultism and feudalism
socialism,removed,of course not harassing the enemy is acceptable harassing your allies is not
socialism,removed,persistent attempts on our part to create a working relationship with rshittankiessay in particular this is either a lie or youve otherwise done it on nonreddit locations which seems ridiculous since you wont find all of the mods on these nonreddit locations
socialism,removed,they made a meme out of a picture the mod posted to a public chat
socialism,removed,doxxing is where you trace someone via the internet and release their identity address name phone number etc it isnt saving a photo that someone posted in discord and then turning it into a meme is it he willingly gave the photo out and someone just saved it nobody has been doxxed poblachts identity isnt known to us and noone cares about it
socialism,removed,its only ok to ban regular users who have never harassed anyone and just use the subs for fun those who are also mods and have way more oversight and control are in the clear
socialism,removed,stalinists are just edgy socdems
socialism,removed,i will never understand the hate towards police officers on this subreddit to attack property and police officers is to go against the wishes of the far majority for this reason you need to ask yourself whether you are willing to coerce and oppress this majority something which i consider impossible to combine with the ideals of socialism
socialism,removed,but ultraleft had one post which was quickly taken down that doesnt sound like a hub for this kind of stuff and if you really are concerned with harassment why dont you ban sls or fc posters that harass leftcoms
socialism,removed,so sls mocking leftcoms is fine but sts doing it is wrong
socialism,removed,i hate how covering up this conflict is your go to option instead of resolving it the subs you listed have better explanations of what happened than you have here lets go ahead and shit all over the leftcoms too while were at it instead of resolving and overcoming sectarianism it exists covering it up does not resolve it i do not apologize for what may have happened — im still ignorant of it — but the way this is handled is alarming
socialism,removed,posting a picture of someone that they posted themselves is doxxing damn i didnt even realize how is pointing out some of the horrendous things tankies say nasty or sectarianism
socialism,removed,rosabanned
socialism,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
socialism,removed,hard to argue because its basically true im from one of exsocialist countries however much better then ussr it was still miserable socialism is bullshit its doesnt work in reality
socialism,removed,they didnt here communist took power in couphowever to be fair there was strong support for communist party after wwii here its not hard to understand in context of that time and i dont blame people who believed in these ideas back then but the reality is that it was total screw upwe lost years and now way worse off then countries that were poorer then us befor wwii
socialism,removed,ive seen some stupid ass shit go down on rsocialism but this is a new high water mark
socialism,removed,im sorry but this is ridiculous ill never defend doxxing or personal harassment but as an active poster rshittankiessay i can honestly say that ive never been a part of it or seen it occurring no further than tagging certain users in comments and posts i dont deny that it occurs but my point is that it is possible to be a part of those subs without participating in those activities that said i think this is a clear case of the mods here favoring their ideological friends and punishing those they disagree with its not secret that the number of trots and mls modding here is disproportionately high and thus this is part of a broader trend to purge almost all of the left coms from this sub of course left coms are often disrespectful here but so are the marxist leninists of course shittankiessay targets specific users in their mocking and often goes too far but so does shitliberalssay and shittydebatecommunism literally every time they talk about solidblues or other hated left coms of course left coms can be smug dismissive and sectarian here but so are mls literally whenever the topic of left communism comes up please dont act like you have zero tolerance for this bullshit but excuse it all the time whenever its coming from an ml
socialism,removed,years old pulled out that gun in front of a cop what was his reason
socialism,removed,columbus police were responding to reports of an armed robbery the shooting happened after a short foot race officers investigating the armed robbery report on wednesday east of downtown columbus spotted three males who matched the descriptions of the suspects authorities said two of the males ran away when officers tried to speak with them the police chased the pair into a nearby alley and tried to take them into custody thats when tyree pulled out a gun with a laser sight and one officer fired his weapon hitting the boy repeatedly police said once again what was his reason
socialism,removed,you didnt answer my question why did he pulled out that gun after being chased by police why did he ran away from the police
socialism,removed,also i love how you scream harassment but are part of the cwi
socialism,removed,you like to fix for others when they arent asking for that true communistd still no answer to my question is it that hard suspect in armed robbery ran away suspect in armed robbery pulled out a gun if the gun was real more dead cop but hey who cares about that right
socialism,removed,guess im gonna have to juggle accounts then
socialism,removed,his phone number is
socialism,removed,lesser of three evils
socialism,removed,thug in armed robbery ran away thug in armed robbery pulled out a gun lol i use source that started this topic here quite revealing that you call police pigs no bias at all and still no answers
socialism,removed,thats disgusting i understand what he means about haiti but it is disgusting
socialism,removed,most work done by men experience finds
socialism,removed,wonder who the water was taken from
socialism,removed,if jews are considered white isnt saying that antisemetiim and making fun of the holocaust as well
socialism,removed,how many days did they have to wait in line to purchase the water
socialism,removed,by all means post about it on reddit so we know socialism is cool
socialism,removed,it isnt a matter of free speech its how this man can actively call for the genocide of whites and still get support from the university however if a white man were to call for the genocide of a minority group he would be removed from employment and suffer defamation from media
socialism,removed,or let them keep their hard earned money and not give it all away to freeloaders and squandered by government social programs
socialism,removed,those who suffered and have died to fascist trump supporters
socialism,removed,and the extreme right says the exact same thing about the extreme left you are all being used and you are just repeating shit that your side has drilled into your head i used to think democrats happened to always be correct until i realized that the democrats just labelled correct as whatever their stance was if you want to help america youd end the tribalism in american politics instead of demonizing the other side so that you are blind to anything bad that your side does youre pacified into thinking the enemy is your fellow citizen instead of your ruling oligarchs
socialism,removed,you call me whitey like it will hurt me but on the contrary my friend i take pride in my nationality and ethnicity you didnt even offer a counterargument oh and thanks for the downvote what a pathetic gesture
socialism,removed,misplaced antisystem sentiment is the only thing that got him elected it will be fun to watch it turn on him they cant be blind forever
socialism,removed,support a revolution in the face of killing is understandable and fine hoping for genocide is the most evil thing i can imagine the holocaust was a white genocide should we support that because whitey is so evil and if whites in general are so evil as to deserve genocide what did the irish the finns the czechs the slovaks the estonians the latvians the lithuanians or any other white ethnicity that never lead a country until recently what responsibility do they have for the actions of other white people the irish for example were in a state of almost constant rebellion against the british for a millennium yet somehow are as whites guilty all genocide is bad period
socialism,removed,who died to trump supporters links please
socialism,removed,im appalled you would hold human beings with such low regard
socialism,removed,do you even know what happened in nazi germany
socialism,removed,wtf did he order the killing of those people did he put them in camps oh and id loooove to see the sources on your claims
socialism,removed,yall realise the nazi party were socialists right i cant tell if this sub is a joke anymore or not
socialism,removed,constantly comparing trump to hitler and his supporters to nazis is the reason he won this thread is retarded its like me saying sanders is a communist because hes on the left
socialism,removed,dont you think saying his supporters feel no pity empathy or remorse is a tad histrionic thats a very large generalization to make
socialism,removed,sorry but without the freedom capitalists the red army would have lost
socialism,removed,ignorant pc tards
socialism,removed,how man people today will die because of communism
socialism,removed,militaristic imagery like this does nothing good for tensions
socialism,removed,trump is a fascist in the same way obama is a communist the people calling him fascist are a direct reflection of the rightwing redneck caricature
socialism,removed,a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity energy and purity in which a massbased party of can just as easily apply to both obama and bernie in which a massbased party of committed nationalist militants working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites utterly meaningless and has no bearing on this years elections abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion it wasnt trump supporters using violence to shut down their political opponents rallies or intimidating members of the electoral college to the point of needing armed body guards that was the left wing behaving this way
socialism,removed,this sub is a mess literally every thread turns into a flame war driven by extremism and huge overreactions
socialism,removed,why shouldnt the leader of the executive branch crack down on criminals its literally their job trump never made it about race thats something the left does in order to push a narrative it is not we have groups of militant white nationalists in trumps camp he has absolutely plucked the strings of nationalism throughout his campaign these nationalist militants are working with traditionally elite power brokers trump himself and the litany of very wealthy and influential people hes surrounding himself with in his cabinet what does this even mean there are people on trumps side that love their country and participate in capitalism trump supporters have engaged in several acts of violence trump himself endorsed this violence and offered to pay the legal fees of any of his supporters who engaged in it theres been a rash of hate crimes since the election swastikas painted racist slurs shouted people attacked a rash of hate crime hoaxes you mean the violence coming from either wing is lopsided
socialism,removed,no its not im not by any means a trump supporter but his rise to power has nothing to do with hitlers this is a gross and mostly incorrect oversimplification of history hitler was in power for several years before he actually formally started putting people into concentration camps thats incorrect the first camps opened less than months after the nazis came to power with the explicit purpose of keeping political opponents there before the nazis were even in power they used their brownshirts as well as other paramilitary organizations to push their agenda and so did the italians have you seen partysanctioned paramilitary organizations march on the capital did you see socialists get beaten or shot in increasing numbers these things happened from onwards long before the nazis came to power as far as i am aware there is no official political repression for people of all persuasions in the us and especially not from governmentbacked bodies trump whether we like it or not has been lawfully elected he has not used violence to get elected nor has he implemented any decree enabling violence against anyone in fact for all intents and purposes trump hasnt done anything yet whereas the fascists had a pretty terrifying record by the time the reichstag was burning speaking as someone who lives in germany and takes great interest in this period i can assure you that despite all the worrying parallels this is a very disingenuous comparison to make thinking otherwise would be a gross and incorrect oversimplification of history my way of thinking is not irresponsible im just not jumping to conclusion im not saying your timeline is impossible just that were not remotely close to what germany went through from
socialism,removed,lets stop the new nationalist socialist party
socialism,removed,you fucking jewish fascists think violence is the way to go fascism it is you are promoting your radical agenda is meant to create a war between the races wake up scum you are slaves of the international banking cartell
socialism,removed,he hasnt even been in office yet he has passed no laws no executive orders his cabinet hasnt even been approved so far all that has happened was that he has been democratically elected please tell me how that is fascism is he an obnoxious loudmouth yes will he make be a bad president probably does any of this make him a fascist no should he actually try to institute fascist policies ill happy to call him a fascist but he hasnt
socialism,removed,listen and believe
socialism,removed,sorry communists but trump isnt actually fascist
socialism,removed,that wont happen he said he would like to register illegal immigrants because theyre illegal
socialism,removed,youre not going to convince any trump supporters to vote liberal by calling them nazis if the first thing you do is insult me before even starting an argument im probably not going to listen even if youre right
socialism,removed,its a big problem with politics no matter which side youre on i am generally very leftleaning and pro socialism but i got banned from rlatestagecapitalism for setting the record straight the problem with political subreddits is that it gathers people who already agree with each other some are worse than others but in general they tend to lower their standards for ideas that suit their beliefs i hope to correct that whenever i can but im just a humble reader not an historian
socialism,removed,yo do you know what fascism is
socialism,removed,capitalism fails fucking horribly at distributing goods and services to those who need them i think you should tell that to anyone who has actually lived in a socialist or communist country i think the people in venezuela might disagree with you
socialism,removed,only good commie is a dead one hail anders brevik
socialism,removed,the russian winter basically won wwii in the east russia could play the war of attrition game due to higher population
socialism,removed,human beings who broke the law they get punished for breaking the law like any other human would
socialism,removed,hes not even precedent yet
socialism,removed,yeah and the system should be reformed to allow easier ways to become legal but saying oh its fine theyre just illegals theyre breaking the law taking in welfare sending away the funds i live in houston believe me there are a lot of illegals
socialism,removed,theyre criminals and theyll just get deported not a big deal
socialism,removed,murderers are people too their status as human beings has no bearing on the legality of their actions
socialism,removed,as i said he is an obnoxious loudmouth he says a lot of shit that he didnt follow through on in the coming months we will get the chance to see what policies he actually implements i very much doubt that we will see any actual fascism
socialism,removed,you realize this picture features a gun and bayonet pointing at a trump supporter right you are openly suggesting violence against them do you have no shame
socialism,removed,wow i underestimated the possibility for a civil discussion in such a subreddit really impressed with you guys great that this isnt an echo chamber for one sided ideas
socialism,removed,i mean that in the sense that people are being radical for no reason other than the sake of edginess we dont always need to take everything as far as it can possibly go
socialism,removed,what is this meme even about first of all nazi were socialist national socialist second of all communist russia lost people in world war two the most of any country if it wasnt for capitalist countries like the rest of europe and america they surely would have lost that war
socialism,removed,this is nausiating
socialism,removed,you cant just move to another country its not how it works you need papers if you dont have them you get deported most are just looking for a better life but it dosnt change the fact that you are breaking laws and by doing so you are a criminal and besides the punishiment is going back to your country of origin hardly as bad as going to prison
socialism,removed,for real i guess we can label hard working americans as nazis thats always cool s
socialism,removed,nazis was short for nationalsozialismus or national socialism they were literally socialist which means that you fought for the socialist not against them
socialism,removed,what does the worlds problems have to do with us
socialism,removed,so no source then
socialism,removed,we them again
socialism,removed,if you really believe this your education system has failed you miserably
socialism,removed,i said liberal because there isnt any big party in america thats actually socialist in comparison to europe
socialism,removed,you mean the program obama ran and wants to shit down before he leaves office
socialism,removed,no you didnt and no you wont
socialism,removed,thats not an argument for anything even if it were true stop justifying your petty impulses and contribute
socialism,removed,i call a dog a dog and a cat a cat thus why i am calling nazis socialist
socialism,removed,you pathetic reds love to talk tough on the internet of you have never been in a fistfight but youre done talking badass alert in moms basement
socialism,removed,were there real fascists theyd make this same argument you idiots have no perspective or life experience
socialism,removed,and im proud of it
socialism,removed,this is no fucking different from rednecks that stocked up on guns after and said they would take action depending on how far obama took it do you bloodthirsty idiots not see yourselves in each other
socialism,removed,ive never understood this talking point i dont get why this is important and more than anything its fodder for right wing media to mock the left
socialism,removed,does trump have dangerous ideas yes does that make him a fascist no a political philosophy movement or regime as that of the fascisti that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader severe economic and social regimentation and forcible suppression of opposition sure trump plays on nationalism quite a bit not to mention xenophobia but that alone does not make him a fascist were a hell of a long way from ein volk ein reich ein führer i just pulled trumps platform and i dont see anything about creating any of what defines fascism trump is not a fascist by definition and so far hasnt proven to be a fascist through his actions hes from the right no doubts but hes not a fascist please stop using fascist interchangeably with people whose policies i dont like if you want a genuine democratic society you should stop harming public discourse with this kind of low quality namecalling we happen to be on the same side of the political spectrum but that doesnt mean you get a free pass on sophisms
socialism,removed,insult to the millions of soviet soldiers who gave their lives defending against the fascists i would agree with you however stalin was also an evil tyrant not only did he starve his own people in the soviet famine but also of the people of ukraine ukrainians applauded the german soldiers when hitler invaded it because of how bad stalins economic policies were in ukraine
socialism,removed,if youve ever watched a conservative news source that is protrump of the time they think its a joke when people compare trump and his supporters to nazis calling people nazis has been thrown around so many times this election that conservatives dont even care anymore when its said
socialism,removed,just because he isnt literally hitler doesnt make him not a fascist the textbook definition of fascism however does your source while interesting is explicitly a definition of a new term he still ran a campaign on fascist principles no he did not as i have written above you are still misusing the term based on his campaign his official policies and the definition of fascism trump is not a fascist please divorce your political opinion from facts there are lots of legitimate concerns to have about trump but that does not make him a fascist
socialism,removed,coincidentally enough those some ukrainians that sided with fascists probably found out nationalistic fascists actually fed its own people food something communism has had trouble with everywhere it has gone
socialism,removed,i voted trump in and will do it again in even if kanye runs
socialism,removed,cracker
socialism,removed,trumps base was energized by people like you calling them racist sexist and most recently calling for white genocide you can blame trump and whitey all you want if that makes you feel better but the fact is you can only call someone sexist misogynistic nazi islamophobes so many times before they get pissed trump is the result he is the result of the lefts targeting of his so called base and then you have hillary saying that she will talk to white people get real the majority of whites are not racist and to assume that is true only angers people which results in you guessed ittrump in a nutshell if anyone is upset about a trump presidency then look in the mirror because its your doing he is the result
socialism,removed,obama is a real fuckin og and so is his brother they should have dinner at trump grill and make things a little better
socialism,removed,at koch industries executives get a bonus based on desperation suicidesshows that all fat is indeed cut
socialism,removed,shame is for people who respect human life apparently
socialism,removed,yeah thats a totally reasonable request for a claim that you made do you want me to work the mousekeyboard for you and feed you cheetohs while were at it
socialism,removed,lol literally shaking
socialism,removed,that you believe nazis are present in your fantasy world is intellectually disqualifying so your attempts at debate are indeed pointless grow up you pathetic child
socialism,removed,are we going after black republicans
socialism,removed,lol on the socialism reddit yall remember that nazi stood for nationalist socialist party right
socialism,removed,i dont care so long as it uses logic and has basic common sense a good sub is willing to discuss ideas and respect opinions of others regardless of what you think of them
socialism,removed,they have greater influence in congress but not full control he cant appoint more than justices in supreme court also we have elections in and then in years finally the republican party is not exactly in agreement with itself right now checks and balances exist america is stronger than you imagine no need to talk about killing put down your gun and start using logic to convince minds and hearts
socialism,removed,pretty solid policy if they disagree then silence them sounds pretty socialisticcommunistic to me yall do a really good job of sticking to that
socialism,removed,im sorry but it what way did socialists help take down the nazis that was accomplished by a bunch of capitalists and a dictatorship
socialism,removed,wut he wants to have more peace and less wars he wants to spend the money on americans instead of foreign wars and foreign bases the muslim registry is already a thing although it was fased out in it could come back fast but that is a religion and judaism is an ethnicity
socialism,removed,the increasing persecution of left wing academics to be honest left wing academics has been the aggressor in social tyranny and is a fucking joke at this point its just getting tired and people dont want to listen to some person thats only qualification seems to be screaming about their emotions and calling for people they dont understand to be banned from universities there is a reason youre calling it left wing academics instead of just academics
socialism,removed,dank meme friend cant wait for the neckbeard uprising any moment now im sure
socialism,removed,i guess when theyre a fucking maoist everything looks like liberalism i honestly cant believe this sub defends that shit its not funny its not fucking postironic or whatever it makes us look as bad as the right likes to make us out to be uncritically embracing authoritarian butchers but hahaha gulags amirite
socialism,removed,yeah but trump supporters are the ones with guns and liberals arent fond of war so they werent the ones who fought in and why the hell do they have muskets basically this isnt going to happen
socialism,removed,rise up comrades together bernie can win and we will defeat le drumpf
socialism,removed,that seems like a fair sentence for counts of attempted murder shorouq dwayyat had expressed her desire for martyrdom on her facebook page earlier that day im going to become a shahid shorouq dwayyat wrote in a facebook post wednesday morning in the post dwayyat a resident of east jerusalems tsur baher neighborhood and a student at bethlehem university wrote mother where are you going mother i am going to become a shahid mother i want to ask a request of you dont cry about me when i become a shahid our greatest desire is to become shadids for allah read more here httpwwwtimesofisraelcomimgoingtobecomeamartyrpalestinianteenwrotebeforeattack typical israelis squashing a young girls dream
socialism,removed,no it was considered self defense because after he was stabbed she continued to attempt to knife people whats astonishing to me is that she was treated in the same hospitaland with the same level of care as her victims until she was healthy enough to stand trial
socialism,removed,they are far from democratic
socialism,removed,fuck black lives matter all lives matter period
socialism,removed,srsly socialists have zero tolerance for dissenters
socialism,removed,how so
socialism,removed,or or ormaybe its that whites are killed more often by police than blacks and while youre more likely to be shot by police if your black it directly correlates with the amount of crime blacks commit while they only make up for of the general population they commit more than of violent crime when a murder takes place between a black and a white of the time the black is the offender when a murder takes place between a hispanic and a black of the time the black is the offender blacks disproportionately commit the most murders in the last decades blacks have murdered other black people no outrage from blm tho they disproportionately commit violent crime so when you have a small group of people committing so much of the violent crime of course their chances of being shot by police will go up due to numerous reasons such as resisting or drawing on officers its been a while since i looked at the data and it might have changed but the number of unarmed blacks that are killed by police each year is below so maybe just maybe people are tired of people throwing up the blm sign because based on the data blacks arent targeted by police in order to kill them yeah theyre overrepresented in crime statistics but thats easily explained based on the fact that blacks commit so much crime compared to every other race so these blm signs and protestors only serve to divide us maybe if they took the stance of policejustice reform rather than blacks are being hunted down they would find greater support also when they make people like mike brown their martyr they lose support or when members riot and burn buildings down and verbally assault anyone who doesnt expressly support them but hey say that im racist because i dont support blm that seems to be the narrative lately anyway also heres a nice juicy source that also explains the data
socialism,removed,yup came in from rall and couldnt resist commenting figured ill be banned but its not like i plan on coming back to this place i also expect a heaping amount of downvoteswhich also means bothing
socialism,removed,ah but i dont fail to see it what i see is a problem in culture and education you can also explain some of these issues with the broken windows theory but mainly education and the promotion of thug culture maybe if we massively reformed the education system we could keep more blacks in school and off of the streets more blacks in school and focused on grades means more blacks in college getting degrees or in tech schools learning a trade both of these options are the correct ways to clime the socioeconomic ladder instead we have the glorification of a thug culture and entities such as the media pushing out false information that continues to decide us but hey blame everything on cops and them being poor thats fine my entire family rose from poverty due to hard work
socialism,removed,happy cakeday fellow redditor
socialism,removed,some crap well put
socialism,removed,dont cops kill more white on average by a large percentage honestly blm to me draws a divide and makes it us vs them we can all agree police brutality is a problem that impacts everyone its something we can all fight against regardless of our color
socialism,removed,while whites have been unjustly killed by cops blacks seem to be killed more often you sure thats not just the huge media bias talking ive read plenty of articles this year of white kids being gunned down while not resisting while lying down on the ground or whole in their vehicle pulled over
socialism,removed,holy shit
socialism,removed,i love blacks but i hate niggers chris rock
socialism,removed,you only see it in the news more often white people are killed twice as often as blacks and blacks are more likely than any other race to kill police neither of the recent killings were unjustified the same way some have been in recent history my question to you is why dont black lives matter when its black people doing the killing its a bullshit cause full of racists who feel a need to blame everyone else for their faults as people httpsislimgmvypnqpng
socialism,removed,except blm is racist and divisive the people here in rsocialism should know better than anyone that what blm wants is segregation
socialism,removed,bloodshed just leads to more bloodshed
socialism,removed,could it be that for over years minorities have relied on the government to give them everything they have probably not here in this subreddit though right did you know that during slavery most black families had both parents that post slavery during jim crow laws black families had both parents but then after the civil rights movement and the welfare state most black families are single parent
socialism,removed,you didnt even look at the statistics the first two deal with the fact that cops kill twice as many white people as black people every year dont tell me the stats are wrong when you dont even look at them
socialism,removed,doesnt prove that blm is in fact a racist and segregationist movement though blm is very important and serves a useful function but i wish the group would disavow some of the more racist loud members it makes it difficult to support them although i will always support their original stated cause but their original and current cause has always been divisive regardless of racist loud members any cause that says us vs them will always be divisive the point that black people are mistreated by police which statistically isnt true might very well be a worthy cause but shouldnt the message be we should all be treated fairly not we want to be treated differently than we are now as for it being a segregationist movement blm wants their police their politicians their laws their media thats segregation regardless of whether that in itself is a good or bad thing its definitely divisive theres no way around that
socialism,removed,really constructive valuable input
socialism,removed,liberal alert
socialism,removed,i agree they need to get rid of the racists but your mistake is assuming they arent centralized there is a central leadership currently the leader is a man named shaun king and while he may not spew the hatred it doesnt mean that his followers are less racist for it i dont see anyway they gain ground as a true movement for equality without completely dissolving and becoming all lives matter because they are not being unfairly murdered by police perhaps it comes from my beliefs as a libertarian but blm turns white people into scapegoats for the fact that some black people are awful scum of people was a pedophile and a felon with a long list of criminal activity including resisting arrest and reaching for a cops gun nearly exactly what he was killed for this is not a person the black community is missing but because this pedophile died they shoot cops and kill that sends a message that can not be taken back blm would rather a black pedophile be alive than multiple police officers regardless of whether the attacks were ordered by blm as an organization or not they shouldnt even exist they pour gasoline on a fire they started and then point at white people and police like they are the problem we can not advance as a people until black people as well as others take responsibility for themselves you cant blame the police for all your problems you cant blame white people for all your problems grow up move forward take responsibility for yourself and stop blaming me just because my skin is white dont worry about the downvotes im presenting an outside opinion backed up with facts two things not treated kindly on reddit im used to it by now but thanks for keepin it civil
socialism,removed,try to act like its black supremacy or some crap that is what some members of blm seem to think too
socialism,removed,leftism is a coalition of kikes cucks and coons against european civilization
socialism,removed,you said people on the right think its black supremacy or some crap i agree its some crap i dont think dr king would agree with their methods and he accomplished a lot all lives matter black ones white ones yellow ones red ones i dont want to be divided by race people who support that ideal are racists we have a police problem in america everyone thats not affluent knows that it does not matter what color you are police officers have changed from protecting and serving to acting like an occupying force enforcing the law for some not so much for others
socialism,removed,this line of thought is the problem
socialism,removed,post it in rsocialistmusic
socialism,removed,i dont agree that the problem is institutional racism during police simulations black officers were twice as likely to shoot an unarmed black man than white officers black men are more likely to resist arrest than all other races combined and police shootings of unarmed black men only accounts for of homicides for black males while over of black male homicides are committed by other black males in black men where more likely to commit murder than any other race in they were more likely to commit murder than any other race in there were about interracial crimes of that whites were the victims of the time police know all this they arent being racist black lives do matter all lives matter but do they matter to blacks the statistics dont show that they do
socialism,removed,obviously how could i associate them with what i dont know
socialism,removed,oh httppbstwimgcommediacfzcxwwwaatemjpgsmall is that fake then
socialism,removed,okay then that didnt answer my question though
socialism,removed,oh boy you really think that the right cant think constructively or objectively you sound like a high schooler thinking your political opponent is just dumb while you yourself are smart
socialism,removed,my wife and i are republican shes a physician and im a firefighter and a veteran we have multiple degrees and are financially sound i would love to learn from your superior intelligence and moral superiority
socialism,removed,brah youre fucking smart as fuck brah
socialism,removed,so glad this is the way you say it and not a simple enlightening tumblr reblog or a catchy reddit comment cute elgraysoreddit you are so original
socialism,removed,least the panthers had some of the other people at the person serving the food he is an asshole
socialism,removed,least the panthers had some of the issues not just the ones with the black community
socialism,removed,so the best way for vob to get his food is to incite violence on the wait staff blame the people who are eating for having food and setting the restaurant on fire
socialism,removed,fuck off you despicable cunt
socialism,removed,dissenting opinions are the worst arent they
socialism,removed,the people laughing while torturing the boy are responsible for their own actions they werent robbing the lad they were scalping him apparently because he was white and laughing while they did it they are sick in the head
socialism,removed,i have proposed in the past that the jdpon should disperse the amerikkkans throughout the third world instead of allowing them to remain in occupied north america here are some of my reasons a geographic concentration of amerikkkans would facilitate counterrevolution it would also be difficult to exercise proletarian dictatorship over hundreds of millions of enemies we would need to import a huge unproductive sector of police and such from the third world as a practical matter it would be better to thin the amerikkkans out making them minorities in the third world where they could easily be controlled and supervised by the international proletariat amerikkkans will need to undergo reeducation it would be very difficult to reeducate them in their own kkkountry they need to be in a proletarian environment where they can learn from the masses there are land claims to settle mainly for the first nations but also for aztl‡n and the black nation is this a good idea what are its advantages and disadvantages how can we improve upon it
socialism,removed,the rest of the post wasnt that much better all whites are members of an oppressor class
socialism,removed,so basically how can there be white privilege if white people struggle except repackaged to deny white supremacy
socialism,removed,i wonder if progressive berkley will live up to its reputation and shut milos hate speech down progressive bans conservatives who were invited to speak on campus
socialism,removed,you realize that shutting down an event of a man who just wants to speak to people is by definition facism
socialism,removed,nonsociopaths need not apply
socialism,removed,pound weight limit no aggressive breeds unless they can fit in a purse also any large dog that isnt a golden retriever will be banned because some mouth breather may think it looks like a pit bull
socialism,removed,fuck you all poor cry babies honestly kill yourselves
socialism,removed,aww does little billy want the world to work his way
socialism,removed,there really isnt any stats showing refugees are a good thing look at merkals stance on it now after she opened the flood gates she regrets it and now its their number problem you cant explain something to people with stats when statistically and historically has no benefit to any of the citizens
socialism,removed,a lot of them do come here for economic reasons they arent all victims of war
socialism,removed,just going to leave this here
socialism,removed,is this really the hill the left wants to die onthe left is declining all across europe in large part because of the refugee crisis and increased migration from islamic regionsrefugeesillegal migrants are widely unpopular because most arent even legitimate refugees and they dont bring any benefits only cost and harmcompletely refusing to integrate into their host society it would be best if they just stayed where they came from or go to countries that are near and culturally similarno one is entitled to just immigrate to any country they want for whatever reasonbut i guess its better to have all these illegal migrants that despise our culture and way of life in addition too a rise of the right and neofacism instead of just conceding on this one issue and respecting the will of the peopleis it really worth it to give up on all the progress made in europe both economic and social for the past few decades just to take in more migrants
socialism,removed,im a socialist but i really question why people think they can live on a month parttime and minimum wage jobs were intended for teenagers looking to make some extra bucks trade schools exist where you can learn valuable and paying skills and you work off your education by getting experience in the trade i just preferred to do language in college but why dont people today do this you literally get paid to get educated
socialism,removed,using weapons in self defense is something people fantasize about in the vast majority of situations itll just get people killed try this scenario you have an fascist going around killing people in a mall a conservative proletarian decides is nearby decides that hes going to be a hero and engages in combat with said fascist a black comrade hears a gunfight going on and also joins combat unable to tell the difference between two liberals firing guns inside a mall he sees two active shooters and engages with both of them another comrade joins the fight and he sees active shooters shooting up a mall now a police officer joins the fray he sees a crapload of people firing guns at each other panics and calls for backup heavily armed militarized police officers show up and at this point both the only people still alive are our dark skinned comrade and the liberal since the black man must have been the aggressor obviously he is shot and killed in the spot the fascist is given a heros burial and the liberal becomes the mayor after launching a campaign promising to protect the citizens from black criminals the communist is forgotten because hes a communist and fuck those guys amirite ok so i went a little bit overboard with the story line to the point where i had to make massive broad generalizations but theres a very good reason why police officers and soldiers have very strict uniforms its of absolute importance in battle to know who your allies are and police officers are instructed to kill anyone without a uniform and with a weapon for the sake of their own safety for the most part the best thing for literally everyone to do is run and let law enforcement handle it
socialism,removed,look youre the one making broad generalizations about a massive class of people have you never spoken to a police officer in your life most of them take their jobs too seriously protect their friends from the law too much but the vast majority are good people who believe theyre protecting people from criminals
socialism,removed,what the fuck is wrong with you how are you so afraid of someone speaking that you are advocating violent reaction dont you understand you are the problem that got trump elected if you dont want him as president stop being so close minded and pathetically afraid if some dude wants to speak let him speak what does it harm you speak back
socialism,removed,im so scared
socialism,removed,see you faggots there
socialism,removed,gayyyyyyyy
socialism,removed,lol ok me too tanks
socialism,removed,manning never said obama was weak leakder he criticised few decisions but mostly talked very respectively about him trump got that tweet from fox news click bait onscreen graphics
socialism,removed,you can have a mixed economy socialists with a bunch of re tarde d communists also what kind of overly sensitive snowflake sub implements a bot to remove oppressive language you are all afraid of a bunch of words lol pathetic
socialism,removed,she fully deserved it
socialism,removed,please dont condone spitting on people
socialism,removed,no fascism in the us you all are just delusional socialism is absolute shit and many economists agree

socialism,removed,and im donal thump rasablackman
socialism,removed,i helped them feed homeless on the bpp denounce this rbpp
socialism,removed,wow angry and rather vileviolent people in this sub drown in spit guillotine jesus h fuck put you people in charge of criminal sentencing and see how quickly your socialist utopia murders your family i dont think its a good idea to spit on other people fuck me right
socialism,removed,protip when youre pretending to be black dont have photos of your white ass in your submission history dipshit
socialism,removed,im not really up on the bpp denounce this rbpp
socialism,removed,thought so whitey
socialism,removed,yes because the kkk actually has killed people in the context of a marchprotest is illegal in nc
socialism,removed,no official word on their beliefs about the new black panther party are nationalists
socialism,removed,clearly youre desperate for the last word
socialism,removed,i am a comrade but seriously chelsea manning wasnt a whistle blower she leaked unvetted documents to get back for being snubbed by superiors granted it wasnt a war we should have been involved in but she wasnt trying to do the right thing and really doesnt deserve praise im glad shes out but shes really not a hero and i suspect quite mentally ill
socialism,removed,lol good luck be violent all you will likely end up ded as fuck republicans are the most armed to the teeth group of people on the planet again good luck have fun dying bitches
socialism,removed,im just saying she didnt do it for the greater good and it wasnt even top secret we already knew too many civilians died in afghanistan more die in drone strikes everyday im just saying that i dont think manning deserves real praise and i suspect she will be institutionalized after being released or generally prove to be exceedingly strange i could be wrong but i think were about to meet the true manning
socialism,removed,not what i meant at all thanks for playing though its like trying to walk on eggshells with you fucking people for fucks sake people like you are why trump won maybe it has to do with the fact that she tried to kill herself a bunch of times and is already firing her mouth off about obama mark my words you fuckwit shes crazier than a shithouse rat remindme days i was right
socialism,removed,i was getting more of a marchprotest is illegal in nc
socialism,removed,i was getting more of a marchprotest is illegal in nc
socialism,removed,i mean you special snowflakes who regularly take offense for recreation youre why trump won and by the way youre the one who even mention transgenderism in the first place maybe youre the transphobic one for thinking that i was implying that the mental illness to which i was referring was body dismorphia i am so tolerant i dont even see race of gender youre the one that had to make it about that you fucking people i hate you all so much i wish we could go full ussr and have you little pukes fucking purged
socialism,removed,when did i say that didnt make me mad all i said was we already knew about it and it wasnt really news when it was leaked not like what snowden did i never condoned imperialism and never will
socialism,removed,oh shit my bad dog good luck to your foreign fucked ass too pur military is likely more powerful and effective than yours take up arms against and die motherfucker
socialism,removed,america needs the black panthers dont exist anymore
socialism,removed,lmfao your an idiot
socialism,removed,so can we protest the deaths of the police officers they killed
socialism,removed,theres nothing the wealthy love more than when poor people fight each other over ideology
socialism,removed,i can not advocate violence or war but i maintain the very importance of selfdefense i address it again punching the nazi or inciting violence is wrong af but at the same time i will say protect you friends and family by all means train yourselves and prepare do not pretend this world is all lilys and there are crazy fascist and supremacist out there willing to get the jump on first in short you can be killed at any moment there is nothing wrong in saving your own life in that moment be antiaggressiveviolence be antipreemptiveviolence but still you must be selfdefensive the wolves are coming be ready
socialism,removed,and what about people that arent nazis im pretty sure they stopped taking applications in these people are just labelling anyone they dont agree with as nazis or fascists which is far worse than what said accused fascists or nazis are actually doing or saying
socialism,removed,ah very good argument you refuted me very well now who deserves to be punched in the face me who is not a nazi but who someone will probably call a nazi or you or neither of us because violence achieves nothing unless as a last resort when discourse has failed note you havent even attempted discourse
socialism,removed,nationalism is not nazism nor fascism labelling people only makes it harder to come to compromises and white supremacy and fascism arent the only things determining nazism not to mention that nazis are national socialists there is far more to their party ideology than being fascistic
socialism,removed,just because you identify someone as something doesnt make them that thing this is a socialism subreddit youre all communists all communists should be punched therefore if i see you i will punch you because you are a communist are you a communist this is how dangerous this type of thinking is
socialism,removed,you prove to me that he is any of those things and not all of those things are necessarily objectively bad racism yes its bad but is that the actual definition of racism or the white male definition because he certainly isnt an actual racist the burden of proof is not to disprove something exists or is a certain way you claim that he is a nazi you claim he is x y and z so show me how he is any of those things
socialism,removed,how is he racist has he said a single thing that is discriminatory against any race or is he a nationalist coz a nationalist is not by rule a racist just some nationalists are also racist all you have done is call him a nazi a racist this and that without giving a shred of reasoning or evidence as to why he deserves to be called it
socialism,removed,good let the battle begin
socialism,removed,nobody says you need to forgive or even like nazis but you cant use violence against someone who is not themselves violent it reduces your position to something below the people you fight
socialism,removed,i think this post should be removed for enciting violence noone but a nazi likes a nazi but dealing with them by assult isnt the answer it just entices them sad day for rsocialism this isnt equality for all
socialism,removed,the nazis were national socialists
socialism,removed,we should start rounding up fascists and start putting them in camps and see how they like it
socialism,removed,from my experience dsa members have pretty broad ranging ideologies their website is kind of dumb because it tries really hard to be accessible to socdemsleftliberals a lot of the people i talk to hate how they endorse democrats
socialism,removed,good i dont sip tea with the enemy
socialism,removed,never happened it makes no sense
socialism,removed,notice how they all jews bolsheviks were mostly jewish and their ideas are ruining the western world
socialism,removed,does israel count as fascist
socialism,removed,wow way to read more into my statement and make judgements based on your internal feelings rather than any statements i made i was saying its good that they are fighting them so honestly fuck off with that
socialism,removed,donald trumps supporters are idiots
socialism,removed,thats some sweet ass rpropagandaposters
socialism,removed,i kind of love how the poster has to put special emphasis on the fact that the kkk is antilabor yes the kkk is against those damn minorities but theyre against labor that does it i oppose the kkk now
socialism,removed,even the afl which at the time only allowed white men in their union
socialism,removed,mrloveshacker could you please not use period punctuation marks i know this sounds silly but i have been clinically diagnosed with pistaphobiaa fear of the period punctuationby using those marks you are enabling a pistaphobist culture on our beloved subreddit thanks for you understanding and long live fidel castro
socialism,removed,where do i sign
socialism,removed,youre right how f of me im a little s right now and subsequently acting h ever since fidel died ive been m u i would never slur the differentlyabled for doing so would be i now if youll excuse me i must go deliver my capital to the state it is theirs after all
socialism,removed,actually i was sort of wrong the afl did have segregated unions for black workers and being a liberal organization they went along with the liberal trends at the time like supporting segregation and accusing the more militant radical members of being communist sympathizers implying thats a bad thing httpsiwworghistorydocumentsmisctripp
socialism,removed,if so easy to do nothing and amass a fortune why dont all the people complaining about not having money just go out amass a fortune its easy you just do nothing and the money stacks itself no hard work no failure no having to reinvent yourself multiple times none of that happens getting rich
socialism,removed,you can sign up on the fact that the iww is a threat to capitalism
socialism,removed,can someone please shoot him already
socialism,removed,how can we socialists help the working class was taught to hate minorities so the iww is a threat to capitalism
socialism,removed,we cant say stupid anymore what
socialism,removed,here comes the feminist pseudo marxist bourgouise first worlder to tell everyone they will be banned for saying the word dumb as if weve achieved some high form of communism already where ignorant reactionaries and bourgouise dont exist identity politics belong in the trash both left and right you literal reactionary language police splitter
socialism,removed,spread messages about social disunity disparage capitalism to your friends and family try to convert them people of the west are disillusioned with their government whether were talking about westminster or washington you just need them to realise that theyre disillusioned
socialism,removed,how is this more relevant than ever i feel like the kkk is less relevant than ever
socialism,removed,well shit im antilabour too in the good way ya know
socialism,removed,plenty of terrible world leaders were supposed to be the catalyst for change we need an uprising from the masses or an invention that shakes up classbased societies if we want change cant rely on leadership positive or negative which works to maintain the status quo i thought the internet might be that invention corporations have their hooks in it now politicians are controlling it with laws on pricing and infrastructure not to mention content and tiered read classed access to controlled content and the merging of giant telco conglomerates into oligarchies have destroyed that hope marx theory of history will see this epoch extended beyond its natural life thanks to these nihilists who cling to wealth and power
socialism,removed,no joking racists and capitalists should be put in prison to work until they smarten up or die
socialism,removed,did you just assume my gender triggered
socialism,removed,lost my sympathy when he said he doesnt vote
socialism,removed,eric garner was killed due to the types of over policing and regulation that result of progressive socialist policies
socialism,removed,white mans burden
socialism,removed,thats not who gulags are a good idea
socialism,removed,zizek and rall said it best if clinton had been elected the festering that led to trump would have worsened and we would be in the same or worse situation in a few years or less people of conscience have to choose one party or the other through which to help create the conditions favorable to the broader effort we cannot face the reactionaries that have taken over the republicans until we remove the reactionaries blockiing our way from within the democratic conduit the republicans are in charge because of failure to understand this the supreme court will go conservative because of failure to understand this meanwhile those same genius democratic reactionaries will scapegoat those of us trying to remove them until they finally are removed as complete obstacles
socialism,removed,identity politics are what will kill socialist movements every time
socialism,removed,hey man the kkk is less than relevant in todays society and have absolutely no influence on government policies it would be career suicide to take sides with them
socialism,removed,this caricature is such full of shit
socialism,removed,ill leave this here
socialism,removed,its not that you do opensource because it is somehow morally the right thing to do he says its because it allows you to do a better job i find people who think opensource is anticapitalism to be kind of naive and slightly stupid linus
socialism,removed,im very disappointed in this im sure that karl marxs idea were also dismissed by reactionaries like you but those all died in gulags and you will too
socialism,removed,the difference is that you only have one awful candidate to choose from instead of two sounds amazing
socialism,removed,jesus like i said i think you make good points but the severity is just too much america years from now will not be post germany it just wont the constitution will still be sitting where it always has been and itll be more or less unchanged people arent going to be raping women in the streets and murdering minorities any more than they have been in the last decade
socialism,removed,i never understood the antilabor one or the generalization of millions of people because you dont agree with a few
socialism,removed,im sorry but when did this happen and i dont mean taking a knee thing all i ever heard was people complaining that someone said it was disrespectful like offended that someone somewhere was offended big deal if grandma was offended get over it already no one is condoning racism en mass now get over yourself geez people
socialism,removed,go fuck yourself you screaming maniac ive never been on the donald and dont give a fuck those people i like socialism thats why im here ill call a person a rapist after theyve had there day in court for it youre obsession with fascists is odd and comparing trump to mussolini and hitler is just wrong especially when he hasnt even taken office yet i doubt hell do more harm than obama did during his years
socialism,removed,should the idea of confinement not be for reformation sure what about the subhuman pieces of shit that will remain reactionary during revolution or after if so i dont see the point in having it be merciless such as gulags historically have been as have they been intended to be are you pretending that american prisons are merciful i dont want to be a liberal about any of this but the thrown around suggestion of gulags nonironically seems pretty daunting how many poor people died today because of capitalism why does deescalating the violence and concentrating it on the offending class of society bother you in this context
socialism,removed,i hope you get a paper cut on your tongue from a razor in a paper cup i hope every soda you drink already shaken up i hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun i hope your titties all saggy in your early i hope theres always snow in your driveway i hope you never get off fridays and you work at fridays thats always busy on fridays i hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket i hope its ben and socrates poop all up in your kitchen i hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck and your headphones short and your charger dont work and you spill shit on your shirt i hope you happy i hope you happy

socialism,removed,no im not a social democrat
socialism,removed,of course being a prisoner sucks thats the idea putting someone in prison is designed to deter them from committing more crimes does the criminal justice system need work yes but if you dont want to be subjected to this mess dont break the law

socialism,removed,a democracy is a reflection of its people
socialism,removed,lol okay httpswwwhrworgamericascuba also you cant deny their government is authoritarian they cant elect a new president at all
socialism,removed,these people i like einstein but unfortunately he was a hardline georgist and not a socialist like people seem to think what he considered socialism and what we consider to be socialism are not the same thing and the only thing we can really get out of this essay is that he was slightly critical of the way capitalism functioned in his day however his solution is not compatible with ours and is something we should still be highly critical of men like henry george are rare unfortunately one cannot imagine a more beautiful combination of intellectual keenness artistic form and fervent love of justice every line is written as if for our generation the spreading of these works is a really deserving cause for our generation especially has many and important things to learn from henry george you people downvoting me are fucking idiots einstein wasnt a socialist no matter how bad you want to believe it thats two i didnt feel like searching for more
socialism,removed,this is a vague as shit statement what has this to do with the the cwi telling people to vote bernie and stein dropping any real revolutionary language and ideas and in general just being a party for themselves
socialism,removed,i am working class the depth of separation you have with me is amazing
socialism,removed,not a party that is composed of about active members in a country as large as the us
socialism,removed,why the fuck do i need you at all when your party rejects basic marxist ideas does not articulate a revolutionary program and basically treats me as an abstract entity i specifically asked about working class people who know nothing about communism are you going to be our dear leader im working class too boo hoo so patronizing is this how you get working class members who are fluent in marxism or is having us detrimental to your ideological position wanna play count the beans to see who has the true proletarian credentials or do you want to actually talk and not be a pedantic butt i dont have to play any games in providing evidence that this party is composed of a majority of academics who have no connection with the working class who barely even want to have a connection who dont have a real grasp of theory and who have this conception of themselves as an outside force that saves us poor working class folk by folding them into their own labor armies
socialism,removed,welcome to rsocialism where if you doubt someone criticising the government for silencing people you get silenced

socialism,removed,maybe putin will send himself to the gulag
socialism,removed,he was clearly not talking about that kind of fake genocide he clarified and gave an example of the type of genocide he is talking about the kind that includes rape and the murder of children
socialism,removed,its alright it doesnt glorify castro but also it does point out america fucked cuba by the embargo i mean lets remember theres not one government on this planet thats not flawed castro wasnt the most perfect but is vilified so intensely in the right and left media side note would watch season three if season is about the godmother and the oakland connect anyone see cocaine cowboys its lit
socialism,removed,as pointed out earlier this was an ordinance pushed for and passed by the openly gay liberal mayor in houston with strong opposition from the conservatives it restricts churches from giving to the homeless good work liberals and atheists starve the homeless seems like a good campaign slogan for the next far left presidential candidate
socialism,removed,how is this different than muh freeze peach
socialism,removed,this guy also said make communism brutal again does he not know what communism is because he insists that he is one of us
socialism,removed,is my avatar
socialism,removed,this guy is best example how racist mindset can be equally spread by those who oppose racism just because some black girl straightens her hair is not a political act stop mixing politics into private lives of people there is no such thing as the white suprematist idea of beauty only white suprematists believe that bullshit people are free to do with their body what they like white skin was considered attractive in japan long before europeans even invaded that country not to mention japanese society is itself extremely nationalistic and reappropriation of different external fashions into their culture is simply the way their culture always has functioned and japanese themselves are widely aware of it learn before you give an opinion what is going on is human image was turned into commodity and is governed by the rules of market and if the majority buys into blond hair wide eyed white girls with big breasts this is a mechanism of advertising and has nothing to do with someones political views capitalism is anticultural and japan if to anything is a victim of capitalist mindset i see a minor capitalist pig in this video trying shift the blame for mindless consumerism towards some evil rightwingers no blacks are as blackhating as whites not because its their choice but because the advertisement taught them to be there are studies dome about how modern society is conditioned towards racism through media this guy using the rascist mindset himself is the best example
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,reality check just a minority of leftists outside the usa adopt intersectionalism and most of them consider intersectional fights a hindrance and a nonsense that wont drive the society towards equality end of the reality check
socialism,removed,not everyone believe that there are trans not affected by gender disphorya for some being trans equals to suffering of some form of gender disphorya intersexuality or other biological or biological issues that go beyod the conscious process of selfidentification in a gender or another the first scenario is not a choice and should be defended protected and supported while the second being a conscious choice belongs to the personal sphere and is not a political or social issue you are free to identify yourself as you prefer but acknowledging your identity is not a given its up to the other individuals to decide if they agree with your selfidentification and this guy does not its rude and insensitive but i dont believe its ethically wrong
socialism,removed,since when did marxism become the same as politically correct culture actually
socialism,removed,i live in europe im active in the leftist circles and in some feminist circles i see the difference between the real world and the american internet the only intersectionalists ive met are mostly anarchists or authoritarian radfem with no clear political orientation you know intersectionalism is a rather new idea and its not an ethical imperative its just one of the many ways you can approach the fight for a better future and to achieve more equality but its not the only way in the usa if youre not an intersectionalist youre some kind of freak but in europe its the opposite because its not a mainstream idea in political circles
socialism,removed,the place where you get kicked out for saying spook because in america it is sometimes a racial slur
socialism,removed,i cant believe i quit smoking just so that this post could give me cancer
socialism,removed,yes and on the other end of the spectrum you have people who dont stop screaming about safe spaces there needs to be a middle ground no homophobes and also nobody who makes the left as a whole look like screaming pseudoliberals
socialism,removed,i mean what i said it true but im just curious
socialism,removed,wow impressive if only your commie friends were as good at escaping helicopters
socialism,removed,so just an asshole then
socialism,removed,as opposed to the misogyny of ignoring centuries of feminist though and womens lived experiences to declare that woman is an internal feeling completely divorced from the physical and social reality of the female body
socialism,removed,terfs absolutely disgust me sorry for understanding how misogyny actually works i guess
socialism,removed,the female body is the original means of production and male attempts to control it are the basis of sexist oppression there is no womanhood separate from the female body
socialism,removed,i kinda gave up on them when they declared war on the word spook
socialism,removed,just pointing out how bad it makes the left look and is a good dividing factor that lots of idiots eat right up
socialism,removed,mudslime dindu no thank you
socialism,removed,its because of the managed economy imposing imperfect competition upon the markets if the markets were free employees would get much better benefits and advantages perhaps you should rethink an ideology you adopted as a year old
socialism,removed,oh no they dont get free shit they dont deserve fuuuuuck
socialism,removed,the far left thinks the same
socialism,removed,yeah well if its antiamerican and youre in america leave
socialism,removed,a youre telling me if i was to burn the nation or party flag in the soviet union kampuchea when those two nations existed or now in china or the dprk id not suffer some sort of punishment under the law b why cant i be is this a closed boys club is it
socialism,removed,a restrained man who was still not complying and possibly reaching for a gun even after being warned to stop moving did you leave the audio off when you watched this i am reserving judgement until we get better evidence did the store have cameras did the body cams pick up anything useful before they fell off did this man even have a gun
socialism,removed,sponsored by adidas
socialism,removed,but the brexit is the greatest victory the left has had in years
socialism,removed,the eu helps decompose the ancient remains of nationalism and encourages cooperation between different nationalities and the supranational state it might hopefully once become will be a basis for a great socialist state unlike the current small nationstates
socialism,removed,better liberalism than fascism
socialism,removed,no reason they were told he was threatening people with a gun and he repeatedly ignored their verbal instructions seems reasonable to me
socialism,removed,not really the eus goal is to unite europe as expressed by the often repeated phrase ever closer union by that they mean federalization and that is better than separate countries in every way its better for capitalism sure but its also better for socialism because its provides a whole european framework for a government basically you need only revolution instead of
socialism,removed,in the video they told him to get on the ground times and tapered him he still didnt go down tackling seems the next logical step i think shooting him was an extreme overreaction and completely unnecessary since they already had him pinned men should be able to restrain a third without lethal force at that point especially trained police that doesnt change the fact that alton disregarded instructions from the police and was carrying an illegal firearm
socialism,removed,i dont know the whole story but from what i can tell yes its because someone accused him of threatening them with a gun and yes he should obey because they are cops thats what the police are for people like alton and you apparently who disregard that authority because fuck the police is why your country sorry if you arent american im making an assumption here has such a shitty relationship with the police if you have cops yelling at you to get on the ground comply especially if you have nothing to hide then later after everything is settled you can sue them or press charges against the person who falsely accused you or whatever if you dont want to do that ask yourself if its worth dying to say fuck the police
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,wow didnt realize there were som many adidas fans here maybe you should start a fanclub wearing a huge adidas logo at an antifa demo just seems weird to me like wearing a trump tshirt at a bernie demo or a swastika to a synagogue an odd thing to brand yourself with buying clothes is not the same as buying adidas or nike or any of the other megabrands with clothes there are options with other things like cellphones and computers maybe not so much and all your downvotes cant make me understand why anyone with remotely similar views would brand themselves with a big corporate logo especially at a time and place like in the photo
socialism,removed,yep everything is black or white minimally paid child labor is just as good as any other labor and putting an advert for adidas on your chest is just as good as not doing it might as well shoptilyoudrop until the revolution since of everything is equally corrupt and bad for everyone im gonna go pour a bottle of champagne in the sink
socialism,removed,how dare you interrupt our circlejerk
socialism,removed,snowden did manning didnt she indiscriminately downloaded as much information as possible and then dumped it a lot of it wasnt even war crimes she was just a mentally unstable person hung out to dry in a sensitive position
socialism,removed,i dont think we will be very efficient if we let everyone manage themself not to mention teamwork would go down the drain im of course completely against letting the current people keep that much power and would prefer selfmanagement over this but i still dont believe that this would be the most optimal choice we could pick
socialism,removed,people are eating trash their pets andor starving to death but you think theres plenty of food to go around and everything would be fine if the workers could truly seize the means to production really must be nice to ponder all that from your clean bed in your safe house typing away on your iphone asshole
socialism,removed,hmm kinda funny how its ok in other places with free markets though huh blame it on anything else
socialism,removed,ill take the opposing side for the sake of it here youre saying that american terror victims dont matter more than syrian which is true when you back up were aliens watching us id imagine theyd have no reason to believe one is better than the other at the same time the us is a country that needs to mind its own business and this is one way of doing it i dont know why being born anywhere should give you access to everywhere and its simply a matter of managing resources even in a onestate world or a nostate world at what point can i affect someone how far away can or should i be to put it in new perspective what would your opinion of me if i said fuck it im going to norway her er det så jævla dårlig and then just went over started consuming their stuff and having opinions about norway while not having contributed as much as other people
socialism,removed,this was a point i already addressed its not that were not taking in enough refugees not that we arent giving enough welfare to refugees its that we make any distinctions between american people and syrian people or any other people there is no justification for prioritizing the people that were born inside your special imaginary lines
socialism,removed,i wouldnt call what hes doing trolling but hes locked in and that isnt changing if it helps i understood your point and can abide by much of the sentiment
socialism,removed,and why arent people flocking to africa those are predominantly poor countries why are they poor unless youre a racist in which case get out of this sub the answer is national boundaries and the actions of states
socialism,removed,you know exactly why they didnt mention it
socialism,removed,probably because this is a terrible idea creating value and being able to reap the earned rewards of that value is not private tyranny whos going to sign your paycheck if nobody wants to be entrepreneurs
socialism,removed,predominantly also refugees would be concerned with average wages not gdp
socialism,removed,entrepreneurs create nothing the value of any product comes from the labour of the workers that created it that is simply delusional employees cannot create a company if a company did not exist yet there cant be employees of it there has to be somebody who takes a risk to start a business and when they do they are the laboring worker creating value in products a product they created no less whos value could not be realized without them thinking of it and executing it originally a collective of workers couldnt and wouldnt start a microsoft thats ridiculous what is exploitative about people choosing freely to accept a wage for a job
socialism,removed,lmao do you enjoy showcasing your economic ignorance
socialism,removed,nigerian gdp is higher than sweden yeah and it has times as many people whats your point
socialism,removed,economic migrants what
socialism,removed,isnt the end game of socialism that everything is run by the state wouldnt support for that end up being nationalist as well at least until the entire globe follows suit
socialism,removed,jason unruhe
socialism,removed,would you preferentially treat your family over another person outside your family friends
socialism,removed,i certainly believe there is still a place for private ownership and wealth then youre not a socialist
socialism,removed,i mean this in the most respectful way possible why do you as a soc dem think were anywhere close to the same page it seems like we hardly agree on anything much less the ownership of private property literally one of the biggest things socialism is against
socialism,removed,then youre a social democrat not a socialist why do you think full social ownership wont work
socialism,removed,you know that shits bad when a libertarian socialist wants to send them to the gulag
socialism,removed,youre a social democrat not a democratic socialist
socialism,removed,a riot is the language of the uneducated granted the uneducated are often unheard this is for a good reason nobody wants to converse with ignorant people
socialism,removed,basically a silent demonstration to tolerate condone riots
socialism,removed,i just noticed that this thread has been linked to in ranarchocapitalism
socialism,removed,thats some real intelligent discourse there see what i mean youre the kind of person you has to riot to be heard because nobody will talk to someone only mentally capable of slinging ad hominem arguments
socialism,removed,thats completly true there needs to be a major overhaul of the educational system in this country but the solution is to fix the educational system not to condone rioting
socialism,removed,of course he wouldnt agree with liberal nonsense he was a staunch conservative
socialism,removed,you remember extremely incorrectly
socialism,removed,your point his widow and children have confirmed numerous times that he was a conservative being a capitalist does not make you a ocnservative and vice versa i believe bill gates steve jobs and warren buffett clearly prove that
socialism,removed,what a fucking load of bullshit a riot is the language of people who want free shit
socialism,removed,and i must say tonight that a riot merely intensifies the fears of the unheard
socialism,removed,no im actually subscribed to this subreddit for shits giggles theres a lot about socialists that i find amusing comical at times ill ask hows that socialism of theirs doing in venezuela its stuff like that i find to be funny socialism sounds good in theory on paper but when theory is applied to reality it doesnt seem to work dont get me wrong theres some things about socialism that can actually work but you never want to go full socialism ignore me my being critical of any thing you might agree with that i dont shouldnt hurt you
socialism,removed,yeah throwing rocks at cars attacking white people and looting stores is okay now
socialism,removed,lol most of the democratic socialists in america are liberals
socialism,removed,okay tell me what socialism is
socialism,removed,rioting may be necessary at times but not this time our govt is saying the guy had a gun and refused to drop it what are the police supposed to do
socialism,removed,lemme just burn loot attack innocent people until the video comes out
socialism,removed,i think i may not understand the relevance to what has happened in recent years with regards to riots and protests for the killings of black men by police i understand that conditions are bad for most black people in america but then why is the catalyst for the protests the killing of a black man by police arguably justified when there are more black on black killings and how does the shooting of a protester by a civilian aid the cause in any way a riot might be the voice of the unheard but what is the message
socialism,removed,whose failure though
socialism,removed,everyone hears what niggers are complaining about its just that no one cares because niggers arent human
socialism,removed,exactly how are they unheard they have the right to vote now the shooting was already national news the protests were being covered by the media and the mans family was already on tv what was gained from going from peaceful protest to violent riot who gained a voice
socialism,removed,lenin would have sent these clowns straight to the gulags tho so i think its funny that you quote him here
socialism,removed,maybe if you would stop mansplaining for five seconds and listen instead of talking you would at least understand why it is so important to her
socialism,removed,nigg thugs white people can be thugs too it just happens to usually be black people what are facts racist now
socialism,removed,free speech when they like it lets kill em when they dont welcome to the left enjoy your stay and the ls youll be taking for the next four years
socialism,removed,of course open carry
socialism,removed,folks i suggest we go to rpoliticalrevolution and upvote the crosspost made there that is advertising this ama it will be a good way to pull some progressives sympathetic to socialism into our sub and introduce them to socialism beyond bernie since after all hes a socdem
socialism,removed,too exclusionary should be addressed also seems to be a culture of reactionary violence who decides who is a socialist and whose not bunch of bullshit
socialism,removed,lol you sjw commies think youll be able to do anything make sure to bring your teddy bears for protection
socialism,removed,lol at your username oy vey they know shut it down you damn commie
socialism,removed,all forms of socialism lead to communism doesnt matter how you say it or word it
socialism,removed,virtually none youre at the mercy of the central government
socialism,removed,have you seen him could take a while for him to starve
socialism,removed,when dealing with fascists always come armed and shoot to kill
socialism,removed,most of third wave feminism is bourgeois a generation of upper middle class collegeeducated whites who have turned an equality movement into self aggrandizement and personal vindictiveness
socialism,removed,if you cant find a job that pays more than a year in the us youve got to take a long hard look at yourself and you decision before you start claiming its a societal problem
socialism,removed,i dont think its particularly bad to be classfirst i think holding that class iniquity is the most pressing concern is a defensible point of view what i think is truly indefensible is the nextstage some primarily whitecismale go through where they decide that as a result people focusing on other inequalities are wrong and must be opposed
socialism,removed,id rather have every single murderer released out onto the street and every prison in the world destroyed than what weve got going on now
socialism,removed,so because this is obvious bullshit is that the reason you chose not to expand on this point thought so because wars have never been fought just for the hell of it people arent exploited because some one thinks its fun this happens because as long as there is property any thing can be justified if the reward is big enough this hasnt changed from feudalism to capitalism and will not change until we achieve socialism not sure how any of this ties in with capitalism sure capitalism by it self might not directly make things better for the exploited class however the exploited class can make things better for them selfs under capitalism in the western world every social progress we have had like the right to vote shorter work week healthcare or better wages has been fought for yes it is true that western states are terrible and are exploiting the third world and this is nothing new with capitalism china and india people are unionizing more than ever and things are slowly getting better in the whole of asia im not saying capitalism is good im simply saying that of all the things we socialists consider progress of them has happened during the last years of capitalism and maybe socialism will be achieved within the next
socialism,removed,which is why some vegans believe in bombing animal research facilities or lighting farms on fire as a vegan myself i just wonder if we should target the meat and dairy eaters who drive the demand in the first place
socialism,removed,a you will be blamed for anti semitism b labor is only marginally better than the likud skinheads c one state solution
socialism,removed,a you will be blamed for anti semitism b labor is only marginally better than the likud skinheads c one state solution
socialism,removed,a classfirst mindset would do this sub and the whole left a world of good
socialism,removed,honestly i feel like no matter what jewish people do many people here will call it ethnocentric social chauvinism and nationalism if israel suddenly became actually fully communist and gave palestinian lands back to palestine you would say something like theyre faking it its all revisionist all while supporting the actually ethnocentric and nationalistic dprk look are there ethnocentric jews yes ofc there are ethnocentric everythings but not literally everything the jews do are nationalistic i mean come on the people on the kibbutz arent the ones in government advocating for takeover of palestine theyre just smalltime quiet workers who live on a commune blame where blame is due the nationalists on both sides are to blame not the jews currently living on kibbutz who just want to live their lives in peace without having their country take over more land and without having constant bombings from the other side where they live
socialism,removed,gruesome killing of white civilians both women and children reddit leftists think killing literally anyone is justified if its in the name of revolution never mind the fact that the goal of socialism is to create a more just society nope just gulag everyone who doesnt follow you without morals i doubt that most people here have read any moral philosophy not that you need philosophy to tell you that killing children is wrong
socialism,removed,its absurd to me that a politician with a year history of corruption and so much blood on her hands is considered less evil than the other option who just isnt politically correct
socialism,removed,conservative communists lol well youre a dipshit communist
socialism,removed,place your bets now will the socialists here defend this condemn this or ban us and pretend it didnt happen
socialism,removed,ty
socialism,removed,ive never visited it before but ive heard its filled with brocialists and overall not very good leftists
socialism,removed,die leftists
socialism,removed,you guys outnumbered them and still got crushed six of your guys stabbed one of theirs how weak are you guys lol
socialism,removed,trump is antitpp anti naftawants to normalize relations with russia and maybe is telling the truth i was originally sandwrs but now i am very sorry but id rather support him than clinton also a bit of context i think voting is rigged anyways i just hope i am wrong but anyways i mean watch the earlier videos of him talking about it he sounds sincere but i mean he is part of the wealthier elite anyone but hilary but my opinion doesnt matter my state will go red with or without my vote
socialism,removed,if this is what a handful of us can do with knives just think of what a few million of us armed with rifles can do you leftist want to play you will be psychically removed
socialism,removed,i think overall they are a force for good an image board for socialism was definitely needed to at least provide some kind of counter to pol ideally though chan lefists would try to carve out space on pol which gets extremly high numbers of users people there claim that the reach of pol is equivalent to cnn its arguable that pol is the mainstream in some regards back when had the news board there was still loads of racist shit but there was more balance and there was less of the assumption that the board culture was extreme right and bigoted so leftypol is a good thing but they need to make moves into pol because the platform is tiny in comparison
socialism,removed,its a convenient way of shutting people down based on who they are or who their ideas are vaguely associated with without ever having to actually engage with the argument put forward classic idpol
socialism,removed,the admin and mods are fully blown gamergaters as well hold up i gghazi into the garbage can of ideology it goes the wage gap isnt real pay gap and wage gap are different and patriarchy by most definitions also isnt real either im still confused by feminisms insistence on focusing on trivial womens issues instead of glaring mens issues which is why the mrm came about in the first place im not opposed to it just skeptical if you think efforts to keep politics out of video game culture as in a politically correct expectation like that the comic book industry is plagued with and journalism basically boils down to the above have been tainted by reactionaries you must also admit feminisms well is poisoned from the second wave on it has been plagued by transphobia which has only partially left it toxic malebashing still essential blaming masculinity which is a poor undialectical way of looking at things which tends to blame hormones and gender as much as social expectations whitebashing lgbt sectarianism acehets arent lgbt bisluts arent lgbt etc seeing sexism where it isnt as well as the fact ive noticed that making a point that doesnt make any empirical sense at all will still get you praise if its about feminism actual tumblr post with hundreds of thousands of notes its no coincidence that we describe healthy teeth as straight and white and also im salty about intersectional feminists sticking their dirty tendrils into issues that arent about them and making it about them like gang violence and capitalism and colonialism puerto rico that being said yes channers largely misunderstand or dont care about feminism so they resort to contrarianism
socialism,removed,in this case the antifa guys made the crew look good they were practicing free speech the antifa tried to censor them with knives and violence its becoming a parody of itself after all suppressing free speech is straight out of the fascist handbook
socialism,removed,in this case the antifa guys made the crew look good they were practicing free speech the antifa tried to censor them with knives and violence its becoming a parody of itself after all suppressing free speech is straight out of the fascist handbook
socialism,removed,the left represented by people who share the fascist aesthetic censoring free speech is a pretty fascist aesthetic it all makes sense though che guevera also killed anyone who disagreed with him as well as gay people
socialism,removed,edgy
socialism,removed,no socialism without feminism no feminism without socialism socialism and feminism are fundamentally at odds in my view feminism is about furthering women ahead of men while socialism is about equality
socialism,removed,the idea that women are oppressed compared to men we are all equally oppressed by capitalism which is not related to patriarchy which does not exist in the west is the greatest fallacy of the modern age women excel in every area women rank higher in every statistic women spend a huge proportion of household incomes women control a huge proportion of the development of children women do better in schools as schools have changed to be more conducive to the education of women women face almost zero punishment for their crimes the overwhelming majority of people in prison are men when this happens to blacks its considered an atrocity when this happens to men its because men are violent
socialism,removed,men certainly are oppressed men are overwhelmingly the majority of the prison population for example
socialism,removed,feminism as you can tell from its name is inherently about women it has nothing to do with general equality thats called egalitarianism
socialism,removed,that is not true mens issues are not rooted in the system of patriarchy because that doesnt make any sense patriarchies dont oppress men there is no patriarchy in the west the west is highly biased towards women not towards men women are already liberated
socialism,removed,women are not oppressed men are
socialism,removed,lmao
socialism,removed,says the edgy online teen socialist
socialism,removed,im pretty sure the allied troops were trying to fight a war and take back a country invaded by another state false equivalence
socialism,removed,i cis female scum got called a brocialist on numerous occasions simply because i am strongly opposed to tumblr style feminism which is thinly veiled matriarchy nothing but a group of liberal misandrist cancer i call myself an egalitarian not a feminist since modern feminism has become the tumblrina style bullshit now im fully against slut shaming the objectification of women equal rights for lgbt and whatnot but the whole id pol bullshit and the people should be able to walk around naked and similar liberal cancers are terrible im very antisjw and people dont realize sjw is an insult directed towards people who say all of these things but do nothing to address actual problems such as poverty classism and whatnot they are liberal scum and they are not comrades in fact even when i was a liberal i couldnt stand them probably gonna get downvoted into oblivion to say this but most socalled brocislists merely oppose this dumbass sjw movement which doesnt give two fucks about the socialist movement they are the people that will vote for hillary just because she is a woman just no i hate sjws tumblr is cancer i prefer people who actually care about class struggles instead of people that hate all men has never heard of class struggle and is only helpful for the lgbt equality movement but nothing more they are liberals at best and that is what i feel people think a brocialist is you know people who realize tumblrinas are nothing but reactionary libshits whose only help is seen in the liberal lgbt movement i am a female egalitarian who fights for equal rights for both men and women and actually cares about class struggle and ending poverty
socialism,removed,anyone who disagrees with me is a fascist hurr durr le online pseudo socialists of the world unite hurr durrr
socialism,removed,is the best way to fight fascism is to be fascist
socialism,removed,no one is forced to drive an uber if theyre doing it its because they believe it to be in their best interest

socialism,removed,go die in a fire
socialism,removed,sjws the thought of pouring molten iron on your soft liberal skull fills me with joy
socialism,removed,bad idea to give them the attention
socialism,removed,lol left coms
socialism,removed,if socialism can be so easily undermined by capitalism and always is doesnt that just prove that socialism cant work id analogize this to saying that my mouse trap would work if a mouse activated it but none of them are so therefore its the fault of the mice and not the trap
socialism,removed,well with brexit its another good indicator of the failure of communism
socialism,removed,fuck you
socialism,removed,are you saying that someone cannot both believe in free markets economics and in helping those in need without compulsion or profitmaking morality how do you explain the existence of charities
socialism,removed,since the implementation of a socialist utopia requires a transition from a state to anarchy is it not at least a valid criticism to say that socialism has failed repeatedly since it has never been able to effect this transition successfully
socialism,removed,i support and understand the message here but this is why grammar and punctuation is important
socialism,removed,not a joke but i made up some communist pickup linesive replaced any hes or shes with comrade to keep things genderneutralalso most of these are pretty raunchy and could bee considered distasteful you have been warned hey comrade how about i seize the means of your reproduction oh yeah comrade youll have marx on you by the end of this hey comrade capitalism isnt the only thing going down tonight are you an oppresive pseudodemocratic neoliberal regime cause i wanna destroy you the workers of the world arent going to be the only ones who need unchaining after im done with youthis ones pretty kinky again i apologize if any of these sound mysoginisticoffensiverapey but considering that the context of them is seduction and not threat and the lack of identifiable gendered language i dont think any of them are too bad

socialism,removed,youre in favor of continuous infighting you just think it should be directed towards one of the only middle eastern countries that offers minorities a high level of human rights
socialism,removed,yes israel has killed tens of thousands over like years thats true to compare like half a million people have died in the syrian civil war in the last few years i was responding to your million claim

socialism,removed,care to elaborate on this claim against canada
socialism,removed,residential schooling was largely a catholic operation overepresentation is a prison system is not evidence of racism fore example blacks commit more crime and are therefore more represented in the prison system
socialism,removed,no one is saying he deserved to die but when you take someone elses private property you run the rest of that person defending their property
socialism,removed,i think we need to take a step back here this is the dark side of humanity in general we allow these abuses as groups we turn the other way as its too difficult to accept or because were afraid of reactions we need to aim to create a society which protects any and all whistle blowers both public and private if we want to prevent these systematic abuses of power
socialism,removed,its comments in this thread that make me realise how young and naive people in this sub really are

socialism,removed,anyones trash if they do something like this
socialism,removed,did you even read all of my reply i clearly ask how this is different from discussion of similar nature like exploitation because of disability race religious belief sexual preferenceetc they all get lost in the sheer volume of posts are you suggesting that feminism is any different from these in value please refrain from saying what i care about when i have not spoken of such thing my statement is clear and you are deviating with personal attacks when i have not resorted to such thing lets keep it civil i can see how well you have learned to use the teaching of socialism to repress other peoples opinions and point of view with opinions on what they are thinking without asking dont think for me tell me your points of views not what you think my point of view is dont impose your bias on others marx the father of socialism promoted analysis and objective discussion not telling other what they care or dont care about in the analysis of society that is irrelevant ridiculous that you would use such methods on a socialist subreddit i expected this from mainstream media not here stop trying to find a meaning behind my question that isnt there there is nothing to be honest about my statement is simple how is feminism any different from other forms of exploitation or aspects of socialism that also get lost in the depth of this subreddit why isnt it better to make it more relevant in this subreddit rather than making a new one you want to impose something without any proper argument for it that there are some people who have different views on the subject doesnt make it more important than the subjects where most people agree
socialism,removed,well i dont know about capitalized wordsrepublicans are not necessarily republicans as that denotes a club or movement that may have coopted the word and i have doubts that a commenter on reddit rsocialism has the intellect to define such attitudes anyway

socialism,removed,for socialists clinton is clearly preferable to trump i know she is a bourgeois politician and imperialist but a lot of opposition i see to her such as from the berniebros seems to be based primarily on the fact that she is a woman
socialism,removed,yes i understand some of those words bitch when i have the time maybe ill learn some of this shit lolol so the fed buys and sells federal bonds is that what you mean
socialism,removed,im voting green because i think their values are in the right place for the most part and theyre very accepting of socialistscommunists i also think their visibility is good their organization is strong and ive met some really fantastic people at meetings there are a lot of anticapitalists however there are a bunch of socialist parties out there running candidates if youre more interested in that my biggest problem with them is they all have different ideas how to instigate and maintain their version of socialism and i dont think any of them are gaining much traction because theyre splintered into factions here are some more leftist groups running candidates you might be interested in though httpsenwikipediaorgwikisocialistequalitypartyunitedstates httpsenwikipediaorgwikipeaceandfreedomparty endorsed jill stein
socialism,removed,stop making me feel accountable for my own failures its all somebody elses fault
socialism,removed,hahaha this post is supremely retarded if you idiots ran a society you would be dead of starvation in a month if you didnt murder each other for breadcrumbs first go ahead ban me idiots
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,hello sirs i am a capitalist and i am here to expose my ideas and hear what you have to say i am here with a positive objective and thats to exchange points of view thanks for respecting different opinions it would be easy to solve if we applied the private property rights to this field anyone who pollutes the air which i breath is violating my body and damaging me therefore in a free society with a free market pullution would be banned humanity would start spending and investing money on renewable energy and with a few years all our lives would work with electricity and renewable energies no one would pollute and our planet would be safe
socialism,removed,the people from thailand respected and loved him he did very good economic politics which helped a lot poor families and farmers the population grew a lot and poberty ratios went down all tduring his reign i demand some respect
socialism,removed,nice arguments
socialism,removed,except we dont actually know for sure that zimmerman is a murderer which is why he was acquitted
socialism,removed,my bad ive been bitched at by socialists before for being anticlinton i never understood it because liberalism especially neoliberalism is just as much the antithesis to socialism as conservatism is they just split the fascists into two parties to trick people into thinking one is better than the other like why they let farright extremist groups like the kkk and the like continue their extremism but you get a farleft extremist group and theyll literally drop a bomb on your hq
socialism,removed,i dont care if youre old young male or female dont come at me with a knife and you wont get shot
socialism,removed,you dont live so you have no idea what is going on pkk murdered over in turkey include one of my relative who was a teacher in hakkari city go search the internet tons of women children and babies ohh man
socialism,removed,you dont live so you have no idea what is going on pkk murdered over in turkey include one of my relative who was a teacher in hakkari city go search the internet tons of women children and babies ohh man
socialism,removed,remove everyone that disagrees with me sounds like something a certain german dictator has said
socialism,removed,is this a good place to post pictures of women with cat ears
socialism,removed,thanks for the laughs this was very funny all around hail victory
socialism,removed,wow thats pretty crazy
socialism,removed,if only socialism worked which it never will
socialism,removed,you best be careful because when you attack a strong aryan man youre gonna feel what every other race has felt when they had messed with us
socialism,removed,gas the kikes race war now
socialism,removed,its almost as if a true communist society is impossible to achieve without a overbearing central cohesive force
socialism,removed,americas gonna be so great you pansies lmoa
socialism,removed,people who deny partisan history which is taken for granted by most of the population sound similar that doesnt really say much about the merit of their points though and is just an appeal to emotion on your part
socialism,removed,so the answer is to eliminate all competition and give everyone trophies
socialism,removed,its funny because we dont actually have an ideal free market or capitalism system its corrupted but when capitalism gets corrupted you have rising standards of living and billions of people moved out of poverty when socialism gets corrupted you have stalin or mao
socialism,removed,your are degenerate
socialism,removed,this so called socialist just called stalin a counterrevolutionary smh to the wall with you
socialism,removed,this is true when a country starts to move from freer market capitalism towards more socialism feel free to argue we have moved towards more capitalism and i will prove the opposite simply by googling the expansion of govt and the welfare state
socialism,removed,you are all a bunch of fucking idiots but dont worry youll wisen up once you get out into the real world and get a real job if that ever happens
socialism,removed,can you please explain how their purpose is to record illegal activity but theyre also attacking your democratic rights if youre only practicing your democratic rights you have nothing to fear
socialism,removed,how is this a quote promoting socialism each year gets worse in a socialist system thats why they all go broke and turn back to capitalism
socialism,removed,nonironically larping and calling people comrade in a socialism subreddit lmao
socialism,removed,a subreddit that bans authors for drawing sfw catgirls in their free time is a subreddit in decline
socialism,removed,hmm maybe that government regulation thing isnt working out to well
socialism,removed,can you please explain how their purpose is to record illegal activity but theyre also attacking your democratic rights
socialism,removed,yeah obama and his socialist policies are really hurting the future of america
socialism,removed,read the picture then apply it to america
socialism,removed,thats like saying a rapist isnt a rapist because he doesnt rape everyone he only did it a couple times
socialism,removed,man youre just a liberal even comparing stalin to a protofascist did you learn nothing from the information ive provided showing stalin was not a fascistdictator god even your family were kulaks
socialism,removed,heres a sneak peek of rfullcommunism using the httpsnpredditcomrfullcommunismtopsorttoptall of all time httpimgurcommxrllqt im a bot beep boop httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
socialism,removed,so we are going to take money away from the ones that are doing well im sure that the ones receiving it deserve it im just sorry that i didnt spend my smoking weed and eating cheatos maybe then i could afford some of the things that the folks on ebt and wic can
socialism,removed,well who do socialists im using that term loosely because it seems to get tossed around alot like for instance i consider myself to be a socialist but not your type of socialism support then
socialism,removed,dont you realize that karl marx spent his entire life in london with jewish capitalists
socialism,removed,you need to take econ
socialism,removed,uncle peter cummed
socialism,removed,you disregard whatever you want your argument is garbage businesses hire people based on demand but if high taxes prevent them from turning enough profit to spend on hiring new people then guess what is this not grade economics same as any other cost like say wages when you increase the minimum wage to the point where a business cant make profit then they not only cant hire new people but in some cases employees get replaced by machines its very simple take a minute to think things through before making a comment
socialism,removed,yeah but obama panders the altleft who hates white people theyre all dicks
socialism,removed,absolutely no fucking anime
socialism,removed,your protests are facist themselves
socialism,removed,of course thats why the soviet union just went from strength to strength
socialism,removed,each of those is a previous mod who was doxxed and wanted to make a new account
socialism,removed,well venezuela certainly knows all about this
socialism,removed,rjanitorwatch
socialism,removed,stalin would be very proud of you guys silencing your opponents is a brilliant strategy
socialism,removed,a speech cancelled is a triumph of free speech
socialism,removed,sure but the speech was cancelled because apparently there were threats of violence
socialism,removed,what a shocker to have authoritarian mods in rsocialism im so surprised ––
socialism,removed,you make it seem so easy to decide what is free speech and what isnt its very hard and complicated lets just say both sides dont exactly have a good history of being able to do it well
socialism,removed,what are we doing to do about that start doing real life shit and stop with the fucking bullshit reddit drama also if you could step down as head mod that would be great
socialism,removed,cannot happen then we dont accept your superficial changes we have already compiled popular support against your regime can you not see that you arent even wanted here anymore you lamented your status as volunteers so step down and let others volunteer
socialism,removed,okay so instead of the complete resignation of all current mods how about all current mods must stand for election and if they lose they will then be expected to resign the community understands the needs for broad and inclusive representation but you must understand that steps must be taken to restore faith and trust in the mod team as well as subreddit management issues without all of the current mods at least facing the community on this such a reestablishment of trust will be impossible you see
socialism,removed,to add onto that the leadership should represent the population if the subreddit is male its only expected that the leadership will be too
socialism,removed,he is not a transphobe at all i think your argument was way to far of a stretch and before you call me a transphobe my best friend is transgender and i wholeheartedly support them
socialism,removed,i am noticing a distressing trend of any and all criticism being labeled as brigading by outside communities it bears a number disturbing parallels to other political ideologies and failed ideologies of the past the bottom line is a large portion of the user blase flat out doesnt trust the current mod team and every single step taken from the irrational strike yesterday to slandering anyone who openly criticizes as one of these outside brigaders reeks of little more than theater im just telling you what needs to happen for the community to trust the leadership again take it for what it is or dont it makes no difference to me but just know that the current mod teams actions have done more to damage the image of socialism and leftism in general on reddit than any of the reactionary and protofascist subs ever could the intentions are irrelevant the actions are the only things that matter tldr this is why vanguardism doesnt work fam you cant impose liberation
socialism,removed,heres a sneak peek of using the of all time httpiimgurcomkymaeelpng im a bot beep boop httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
socialism,removed,lmfao this sub is a fucking joke
socialism,removed,i mean he may have deserved the ban yes he does and i think he doesnt well apply for a mod position during the election with that as your platform people who publicly defend bigoted comments on here dont deserve to be banned and see what happens you simply banned him like that yeah i did what i was supposed to do as a mod you think i should give him fast food or something with even a condescengind and smug reply how dare i feel good for banning a bigot today
socialism,removed,the unsatsifactory survey results what the fuck is this are you fucking kidding me we must use our position to encourage as many nonmen racialised folks and members of anarchist tendencies as possible to be nominated ffs there are quotas to fill jesus
socialism,removed,how about the mod team owns up to the fact that they have a near total disdain for the user base and everyone in it your concerns about a fair election are little more than a red herring there are numerous tools and resources available online to do it and they have existed for years as have democratically controlled online communities but now when it comes to this subreddit and the mods in power its suddenly completely impossible to do who are you trying to convince people the mod team doesnt care about you they dont care about your opinions they dont care about your perspective they laugh at you behind closed doors and mock anyone who disagrees with them httpsiimgurcomsesgqicpng httpsiimgurcomxdxzxukpng
socialism,removed,like how the mods have been harassing slandering and defaming anyone that speaks out against them allow me to play on the worlds smallest violin for you
socialism,removed,trans people are workers of course they are and pronouns can be a workers issue id like to respectfully put forward that there are workers issues that transcend gender and yes they are just if not more important just now
socialism,removed,gulag brocialists
socialism,removed,wow you really are a bunch of americans imperialists here all right im leaving not that ive been here long i guess i should rather organize with real people who dont send you to a bangulag for any disagreement bye
socialism,removed,hey alex whats up
socialism,removed,yes yes more infighting this proves literally everything wrong with socialism the eventual collapse into a hierarchy and lack of power for the average citizen if you cant even keep a subreddit true socialist then why the fuck should anyone give you a government the day a socialist society actually doesnt hit the eventual stage of hierarchy is the day i will become a socialist
socialism,removed,the workers issues are the workers issues it doesnt predicate on their pronouns and shouldnt focus on them either the defining characteristic of a worker is that they are a worker by trying to divide workers in terms of what persons or pronouns they are or use you are in fact weakening solidarity and playing in to capitalist hands whose golden rule has always been divide and conquer so where we at now
socialism,removed,heres a sneak peek of rfullcommunism using the httpsnpredditcomrfullcommunismtopsorttoptall of all time httpimgurcommxrllqt im a bot beep boop httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
socialism,removed,did you send him to the gulag
socialism,removed,we need more moderators anyway so an election is prudent however given the unsatsifactory survey results men and nearly white and the lack of ideological proportionality within the team as mods we must use our position to encourage as many nonmen racialised folks and members of anarchist tendencies as possible to be nominated consequently there are quotas to fill which means i dont think race or gender should be a factor in this just elect the best of the community if they happen to be white and male what are they going to do sabatoge all of socialism someones skin color or genitals should not be the reason they are turned down from a position
socialism,removed,video offering alternative places to moderators literally ignoring their user base
socialism,removed,the current mod team is not calm principled dependable steadfast or evenhanded in a moment of random passion they banned a woman for drawing catgirls comics then threatened her on social media for trying to speak out then made a joke about going on strike when they get called out on it and they ended it with saying anyone who supports catgirls are sexist channers were in this mess and the laughing stock of reddit you wanting to reform is great but i dont think it can be done with the current mod team we need administrators that are able to handle problems and treat people fairly and letting redditors with old accounts and ones who arent plagued with reactionary bs or less than a week old could vote in reliable replacements im not saying we should make a straw poll or make a google doc or something lets just have an election like we used to weve done it before and i dont know why there is such opposition towards doing it again
socialism,removed,were being infiltrated by counterrevolutionaries ussr early rootless cosmopolitans ussr late kulaks ussr early trotskyists ussr fascists ussr late leftypol brigaders rsocialism of january brocialists rsocialism of january oh how history repeats itself it seems more likely that authoritarian socialists need to have a fictional enemy in order to stifle any dissent
socialism,removed,focusing on these issues doesnt distract from class struggle i see what youre saying but i think i disagree any movement has a limited amount of resources and in any situation resources should be allocated in such a fashion as to maximize impact while yes other struggles do aid the economic class struggle the reverse is also true so the question is with limited resources which should be focused on for maximum impact for the good of the whole
socialism,removed,see this isnt helpful i feel like i laid out a good argument yet your only rebuttal is a dismissive brocialist fuck please if you have a good counter argument make it i would love to hear it otherwise you are not contributing to the conversation you are only hindering it and you are contributing to the exact problem i am discussing here
socialism,removed,literally as a leftypol user i dont think that it willfix itself but i do think that the limited resources socialistscommuinists have in the us need to be focused on the class struggle
socialism,removed,if you work at mcdonalds dont expect to make a lot of money this is why kids usually work low paying jobs if you cant afford to pay for your kids meals then get a better job its a pretty simple concept dont go demanding a higher wage without willing to do more that is capitalism and that is why western countries succeed this is also how nature works if you cant compete then you dont succeed quit asking for handouts and make yourself useful also companies dont make shiny new gadgets here anymore because they cant afford to because of high taxes and shitty national policies have you noticed all these companies willing to start working in america again since trump was elected allowing a company to decide when it is right for them to automate their business is better than forcing them to i agree it would have eventually happened but does that mean we should increase minimum wage to the point that small companies cant compete anymore you seem to be against large corporations but socialism works against small business only capitalism allows small companies to thrive name one socialist nation that is doing great
socialism,removed,for all the tone policing support you really go out of your way to be rude to people on the internet
socialism,removed,let me give you some definitions dismissive feeling or showing that something is unworthy of consideration slur an insinuation or allegation about someone that is likely to insult them or damage their reputation now please explain to me how your use of brocialist fuck is not a dismissive slur
socialism,removed,lmfao
socialism,removed,i saw we merge rthedonald theyre good people
socialism,removed,why not socialism is about what the people want and obviously the people are mainly white men are you saying us white men dont matter now that the majority and the rule of the people that happens to be mostly white men doesnt matter now
socialism,removed,it is thats what the surgery says
socialism,removed,oh man this sub is just a gift that keeps on giving shine on you differently abled diamonds
socialism,removed,we need more moderators anyway so an election is prudent however given the unsatsifactory survey results men and nearly white and the lack of ideological proportionality within the team as mods we must use our position to encourage as many nonmen racialised folks and members of anarchist tendencies as possible to be nominated consequently there are quotas to fill which means top kek dont worry guys its only bigotry if white men do it its totally not racism if we do it
socialism,removed,the nazis were socialists national socialist
socialism,removed,rioting is a triumph for free speech now smashing shit so your opponent doesnt get to speak is a victory for free speech wow
socialism,removed,socialism is the answer to this i mean with socialism everyone is in the sweatshop yay equality
socialism,removed,very true most toys are manufactured in socialist china and most toys are consumed in capitalist america fuck socialism
socialism,removed,you are not forced to work under capitalism fucktard you are forced to work under socialism since they make you work for the government in a capitalist society you are free to not work all you please but since this is the real world not your fantasy you wont have any money as a result
socialism,removed,i bet people in communist russia wouldve loved that as well
socialism,removed,we cant just hold an election the people might vote
socialism,removed,be careful logic frightens socitards
socialism,removed,heres a sneak peek of rcapitalism using the httpsnpredditcomrcapitalismtopsorttoptall of all time im a bot beep boop httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
socialism,removed,it means a conservative with more nationalistic ideas than the average con so protectionism immigration restrictions etc unlike normals cons we arent considered centreright instead just right wing
socialism,removed,i did change it lol i forgot it was the anarchist flair
socialism,removed,nice hyperbole bud fact of the matter is that the liberals you continue to mock are the ones that commited this act afterwards a homeless woman defending trump is bullied for her beliefs and instead of providing any support to her they cackle and sneer at her position im ashamed to have called myself a socialist
socialism,removed,legalize the killing of homophobes
socialism,removed,the town where you live may have many people whose families had terrible things done to them under that symbol does your town have a similar influx of polish people to other areas in the uk to a good chunk of europe this is a symbol of harsh oppression of course
socialism,removed,it would be better if they formed a human chain to direct whites into the sea
socialism,removed,i doubt youd comment so passively if black people or women were the ones targeted though right
socialism,removed,in what ways are black people and women subjugated are you one of those people who stereotypes all white people especially white males as privileged regardless of their poor socioeconomic standing rural upbringing far from services such as public transportation and access to only a fraction of the scholarships and such afforded to women and black people only i just like the dank memes
socialism,removed,so socialists are racist and sexist
socialism,removed,unironically having a mao avatar and calling other people fascist the commendation of destroying property makes me a fascist stay triggered
socialism,removed,also i think its important we understand and explain the history of the hammerandsickle well some of us do and it was insight it sounds like you could use do you know what that symbol means to people who have had lives destroyed by people who marched under it those people are still alive today do you know how many generations that pain will be felt your second paragraph above which reads like a textbook citation doesnt appear to cover this material the symbol is dead forever honestly find a new one
socialism,removed,regardless of his views sadly hes just an incompetent politician he cant keep his party together and he has zero chance of being elected hes the leader of the labour party the official opposition and the conservatives are currently in power the conservatives had huge internal issues after brexit with cameron resigining and theresa fucking may becoming prime minister thats really bad shes probably more incompetent than corbyn and just generally a cunt yet labour still didnt capitalise on that and gain any momentum i dont expect the conservatives to be very popular by the next election in but labour is starting from behind and theyll need to have made a lot of ground to stand a chance at being elected anyway id be shocked if corbyn was still the party leader by then hes extremely unpopular in the party and is only still in control because labour now lets the public register to vote in internal elections his shadow cabinet is completely useless because anyone competent has resigned by now and he had to pick from the small pool of ministers that actually supported him
socialism,removed,leftist claim they are for equality sees a homeless person in the streets and instead of giving that person a meal or help they circle around and attack her implying this had anything to do with trump and not everything to do with the manner in which the people here act down with muh fascists property as well as the ones in the video cackle at a homeless person being abused by the system i suppose a point doesnt need to be made when you can claim there never was one to counter nevertheless its entertaining to speak with my fellow leftists
socialism,removed,he has nothing on this guy much better speaker and has what i think is a better message
socialism,removed,well if there ever were a major political party candidate that i could see myself supporting id be more than happy to jump behind them i was all for supporting bernie i sympathize with this sentiment but we have to face reality here there will not be a single state that goes to a third party candidate hillary clinton or donald trump will be the next president i dont like it either but that is whats going to happen i disagree with clinton on damn near every issue but she is a qualified candidate and would be able to do the job just fine a clinton presidency would mean a lot of centerliberal policy that pretty much everyone here will scoff at for good reason but it would be a pretty standard presidency nonetheless and who knows she might surprise us a little she has a good bit of ambition and actually wants to do a good job as president she cares deeply about the way history will look back at her trump does not he doesnt care much about anything else than getting a rise out of whatever crowd is in front of him in the last debate he got one big hoorah or whatever the hell from the crowd and you could just see it in his eyes and in his body language thats what he was there for he doesnt give a damn if his policies will amount to anything he just wants to feed his ego in every way that he can whenever he can and also give himself some more tax breaks while hes at it theres a reason why hes still throwing twitter tantrums weeks out from the election and it isnt because he has a winning temperament its because in more ways than one hes a broken man this is a man who says words dont matter while continuing to bash rosie odonnell for something she said a decade ago were talking about a man who has had his entire policy regarding russia puppeteered by putin without even being vaguely aware of it hes easy to manipulate a verifiable buffoon and a hothead this is not the formula of a winning president it is the recipe for catastrophe and of course he casually spews fascist rhetoric and denies it on a daily basis trump has absolutely no place to be in a position of power so with the reality being that one of these two people will be president you have to choose you can vote for clinton or you can vote for a party and just hope clinton wins or of course you can vote for donald trump and get curbstomped with the other fascists
socialism,removed,im not really sure where this person is racist in fact they explicitly said they believe theres only one race human doesnt sound very racist to me
socialism,removed,i like bernstein because he thought that socialism can be achieved through peaceful means through legislative reform in democratic societies im not a revolutionary you cant build a good country on the skulls of your people
socialism,removed,i just see gay rights activism as unrelated to socialism its a lifestyleism gay rights activists can be from any ideological background like preppers or ppeople who use menstrual cups they are certainly not a sexual or racial minority and i dont see anyone advocating purging gay rights activists or gulaging them like has been done in the past to tatars
socialism,removed,seriously is this the fucking state of this sub the to top comment is some shitpost about a tendency none of you nerds obviously understand if you bothered to look into left communism youd see that while activism is disregarded as a revolutionary tactic its not discouraged and left coms arent kicked out of left com club for engaging in activism i swear half this god damn subreddit just joined in on the ultra bashing trend while not reading a single piece of communist left literature which coincidentally also coincides with the fact that those same people also havent read a single piece of theory in their entire lives anyway also yeah ultras are the sectarian ones maybe ill just link back to this thread the next time that meme is being spouted
socialism,removed,ive always wanted to ask a true believer socialist how do you not get discouraged socialist countries always go broke and spiral into corruption and poverty venezuela capitalism seems to breed the most social mobility and quality of life usa how are you never convinced that this socialism shit just doesnt work my take mother nature is capitalism in its purist form socialism is anti science
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,i didnt know much about this but after quickly reading through this threat and other bits online this is a fucking shit show im not saying you should kick out members before an investigation has concluded but you stand by the victim and not by the accused you also sure as shit do not just do an internal investigation also i understand many of you probably have more information on his than me but the bullshit generic gross excuses in this thread just make me want to fucking vomit you want to slander assault victims when there was no proper investigation then to the fucking wall with you run over to rthedonald as they seem to love rape apologists there
socialism,removed,strike is a work stoppage caused by the mass refusal of employees to work wikipedia you need help guidance on how to stop working
socialism,removed,those people are wack
socialism,removed,organize real violent protests id gladly show up to occupy wall street and crush the rich
socialism,removed,solidarity is a four letter word
socialism,removed,too often i see socialists communists and other leftists allowing the perfect to be an enemy of the good to paraphrase voltaire
socialism,removed,its tough working everyday just to pay the bills i would suggest moving to a monestary or fishing commune in mexico hope you feel better
socialism,removed,hahaha this cant believe some of the brainwashed tards on this sub are actually cheering it on
socialism,removed,i just saw a nike ad with serena williams with the words best female athlete typed out but female crossed outmaking her the best athlete ever idk what kind of trendy feminist bs that is but even from a apples to apples comparison its not even possible to measure its simply to convince buyers that nike is feminist but they are feminist to a fault in fact id go as far as to say thats insulting to male athetes
socialism,removed,hahahahaha i can believe in socialistic economic principles without believing in the stupid blm cuck shit and i supported sanders before trump just lol if you think hillary is the better option i feel bad for you
socialism,removed,i feel like theres a paranoid denial of the fact that feminism is in fact often misrepresented by people claiming to be feminists the sjw phenomenon isnt a made up thing there really are irrational people out there who exploit legitimate struggles of people for opportunistic reasons and convince themselves that they are true fighters for the cause this isnt to say that sjw feminists are the majority i would say that the insufferable opportunistic sjw you see in videos make up a small minority of those who identify as feminists but they are loud and often overpower the silent majority if socialist feminists want to win people over and unite the proletariat they have to first acknowledge some of the legitimate grievances against the sjw phenomenon which are currently being heavily exploited by viciously reactionary demagogues
socialism,removed,also hes a pc sex registrant so even without the mediapublic lynch mob which the harsh laws are supposed to appease hes got a statutory civil death if he has a child hell never be allowed to go to a soccer game parentteacher conference etc so its not like theres no lifelong punishment
socialism,removed,i believe in equality both men and women should get leave when they have a new child both should have to register for the draft both should be punished equally for crimes i do not believe in safe spaces and other sexist buzzwords such as mansplaining or male privilege men are far more likely to be homeless since most welfare programs prioritize women they are also far more likely to be sent to prison and for much longer for the same crime plenty of other things but this thread is already an us vs them shitshow being brigaded by both radical feminists and men who have no clue what theyre talking about tldr equality isnt favoring one group over the other if we want to be equal we have to be equal on all levels not just the ones that are beneficial
socialism,removed,or it might be that not all socialists have the same opinions hmm curious indeed 🤔🤔🤔
socialism,removed,because the feminists that are the loudest tend to be stupid as fuck i cant take an upper middleclass girl at an ivy league school who complains about male privilege seriously they alienate the general public from feminism and left causes in general so fuck them its only natural that people like these protesters get hate from the public
socialism,removed,feminists are terrible people
socialism,removed,if you arent an mra you arent a socialist same thing see how stupid that sounds just because i disagree with the movement doesnt mean i disagree that men and women should be equal
socialism,removed,when men sit we spread our legs to air out our balls because its uncomfortable if it gets to hot down there some crazies think its to establish dominance over women
socialism,removed,yeah it could be but its not an issue in the same way that unequal pay is an issue our balls are sensitive to heat if we need to we close our legs like on a crowded train
socialism,removed,the anita sarkeesians and lena dunhams of the world mostly shitty people that just throw thats misogynistic at everyone everyday feminism also invited people to an event called then there are these lunatics its really not true that sjw feminists are just strawmen
socialism,removed,uncomfortable underwear can cause a need to occasionally
socialism,removed,literally worse than the holocaust
socialism,removed,well i wont say i hate feminists but i dont trust them not this current generation of them anyways blame my eighth grade teacher a nasty harpyonly word that does her justice of a woman telling a room full of white boys everything wrong in the world was because of white men this woman in the name of her ideology tried using her position to make a bunch of impressionable year olds hate themselves for being caucasian and having a penis i was already borderline suicidal at the time im fully in support of equality in the eyes of the law but i dont associate with anyone who spews hate against people for something beyond their control nor people who tolerate that amidst their ranks so i might say there are individual feminists i despisefor the same reason i detest racists there are trends within the movement i find troubling but i also recognize that a few people are not a whole movement not everyone can make that distinction
socialism,removed,both of my parents have been involved in cooperatives and communes and so i was raised with socialist ideals liberal as fuck
socialism,removed,feminism is one of the things that i really hate about the left dont get me wrong i am a communist and agree with most economic issues but what sjw do is just stupid all they do is whine on the internet and try to force their believes on everyone and everything pushing ridiculous ideas in such a ridiculous way will just make people hate you and the entire left
socialism,removed,coops arent socialism but theyre certainly based on socialist ideals once again my parents arent socialists but the ideals they raised me with lead to socialism youre arguing semantics and its childish
socialism,removed,once again arguing semantics ideals meaning the base beliefs which lead one to be a socialist because america is capitalist insititutions which hold these ideals eg a cooperative owned by socialists would have to act within the bounds of the system and thus cant truly be socialist
socialism,removed,because its not a formal essay and honestly i was cursing in it anywayand i use cuck as an insult
socialism,removed,coming from a communist
socialism,removed,id have you up against the wall with the niggers and jews too you so no hard feelings
socialism,removed,it is totally a utopia and will never happen sorry im anti capitalist too asshat the economy should be regulated by the state for the benefit of the nation not private enterprise what do you mean by brown people im not even white
socialism,removed,ill fuck most people as long as theyre not righties but id prefer my real partners to be commies im a commie
socialism,removed,i lived in leipzig and met families who had family members disappeared by the stasi go to hell for even posting this shit
socialism,removed,rahowa this planet is ours
socialism,removed,wew lad
socialism,removed,oh i thought that upastaofmuppets was talking about using violence against peaceful protesters i would knock the hell out of someone that was going throw tomatoes at me who wouldnt
socialism,removed,religion is the opiate of the masses comrade
socialism,removed,throwing tomatoes at someone assault advocating ethnic cleansing belief big distinction buddy
socialism,removed,im not saying being a nazi is a good thing its not what im trying to say is that knocking people out because of political views is not what this country is founded on
socialism,removed,the nut jobs that want ethnic cleansing will be sorely disappointed when that doesnt happen the current administration could not even come close to doing that seeing as it would start a civil war and it is a crime against humanity you also cant act like everyone thats a trump supporter is a nazi and start punching them because hurr durr they are probably a nazi lets nearly beat them to death with flag poles and baseball bats and one of these days one of those people with baseball bats is going to get shot you cant assault people because of your political opinion
socialism,removed,i dont give a shit about socialism celebrating violence is inhumane stop pretending like you have a higher cause that everyone has to suffer for even the liberals on the front page have said the same thing and even named this sub with disgust turns out that normal decent people think that beating people with metal poles is wrong reevaluate yourself how would you like it if i defended the shooting on that canadian mosque theyre fascists here to kill us and take away our rights better fight fascism with fascism also dont tell a woman that youre into this shit big turnoff
socialism,removed,oh you forgot he uses violence to suppress free speech oh wait thats what the liberals are doing isnt fascism using violence to force your point of view and beliefs onto others dont be the first one to cast a stone in living in a glass house
socialism,removed,then nut up and actually commit to violent resistance
socialism,removed,and fuckers like you were the ones who were cheering that literal humanitarian disaster on and demonizing as a fascist anyone who said hey maybe communists subverting countries by force is a bad thing for humanity
socialism,removed,wrong our leader is in the white house making america great again
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,actually i vote libertarian gary johnson although i did think about writing in harambe as thats how serious i took this election but its nice to see you label me just coming for a few more down votes
socialism,removed,he was a very learned man
socialism,removed,yes and about if you count per kilo and not per head so you should totally go ahead with that revolution thing asap
socialism,removed,isnt he gay thats an extra level of fucked up i wonder if the gay thing is an act he basically seems like the nazi ambassador to millennials and something like that would definitely make him more palatable although i do feel a little shitty calling his sexuality into question
socialism,removed,youre sure they werent wavering over the horrible optics of seeing unconscious people being beaten in the head with metal poles cause i mean that looks terrible on the news
socialism,removed,naw he was a good dude snd completely correct
socialism,removed,i would rarely say this but i hope someone kills this awful excuse of a human being just toss him in the middle of the protestors and tell them they can do whatever without reproductions fuck this nazi puke
socialism,removed,whats wrong with outing illegals theyre breaking the law
socialism,removed,and in any case who jokes by making a nazi salute if thats your idea of a joke its pretty sick highschoolers you guys are getting really bent out of shape about this its kind of pathetic
socialism,removed,so were they ridiculing trump saying he was a post about this the first time there was a good guy
socialism,removed,dont pass up on this oppportunity socialists this is finally an opponent that you can take in a fair oneonone fight time for some antipubertarian action
socialism,removed,lol he outed him hardly outed who was buying that this was a girl for a second i mean come on seriously why should the delusion be entertained he has xy chromosomes he is a man wanting to be a woman convincing yourself you are a woman pumping yourself full of female hormones does not make you a woman it makes you a man with a mental illness dont give me that trapped in the wrong body nonsense theres no scientific evidence for it when i was i told my family i was a moose they entertained it for a while then told me to stop being silly
socialism,removed,absolute nonsense every news website i read described it as a heated protest when in reality it was a full on riot of morons who didnt even know whowhat they were protesting against i saw no mention of the girl that got pepper sprayed out of nowhere or the video i saw where someone hit another girl with a pole real big of you guys btw i did see one bit i enjoyed when some of you mongs surrounded a guy who was nothing to do with any of it and started attacking his car at which point he just drove off through the crowd while you lot went aaaaahhhhh shame no one got caught under the wheels mind theres no place in society for people that attack people that arent even involved in the issue theyre disputing could have been another reginald denny
socialism,removed,most people arent originally illegal the usa as a country was much more open to immigration prior to the and centuries many are but not a majority even today most immigration is legal only million of the current million immigrant population is illegal currently for reference
socialism,removed,well i guess its time to unsub from this shithole i guess i was mistaken that this would be a place for reasonable discussion and not mindless sensationalism youre all about as delusional as a trump supporter
socialism,removed,extremism can go both ways son i urge you to take another look at this thread and try not to let your emotions cloud your perception
socialism,removed,there is middle ground its called being rational do you have proof that he was going to do this the letter only says that hes done it in the past and that they have fears hell do it again milo is an asshole to the fullest extent but he still has that right to speak freely as an asshole until the moment that he commits these acts or actively incites harm what do you mean by no middle ground does that mean that the actions of antifas is okay with you is going to the extreme of attacking people who agree with him okay thats not socialism
socialism,removed,not an argument
socialism,removed,im not human and im not worthy of an argument because i believe everyone should abide by the law
socialism,removed,well heres a slow clap for you taking your first steps in becoming the thing you claim to hate socialism is not antifascism and antifas are no different than the neonazis im going to stay right here in middleground aka the land of rational thinkers good luck to you
socialism,removed,disarming people who are most in need of defending themselves mentally unstable unstable prone to change fail or give way not stable i dont want a loose cannon who hallucinates people as dragons to have a gun do you ableist piece of shit ableism characterizes persons as defined by their disabilities and as inferior to the nondisabled bigot bigot a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions well that certainly describes one of us unless you plan on disarming police and the military not completely but i do leos should only carry tasers for personal protection swat should have guns but not tanks not the military though but nukes probably arent the brightest idea disarming workers is still treason military personal are workers so are you for or against disarming the military aka workers disarming workers no disarming crazy people yes
socialism,removed,all leftists weak and then violent ones are dumb
socialism,removed,hey uemperorxenu hey ugigimoi
socialism,removed,thanks for brigading trump shill
socialism,removed,sorry but i disagree with you ive lived in germany when neonazis were doing the same thing antifas are just another hate group if the concept of finding another solution other than violence is lost on you then congratulations youve become the fascist that you claim to hate
socialism,removed,so youre solution is the only right solution mlk managed to change the views on white supremacy without resorting to violence youre justifying bigotry hate and violence because you feel that the other group is full of violent hateful bigotsokay makes no rational sense
socialism,removed,nazi lol you use taht word a lot you really like to suppress people by screaming nazi at them its how all of your kind operate its pretty pathetic you preach free speech unless its offensive which isnt free speech at all you are closer to a nazi than your opponents ever have been
socialism,removed,false you are far more nazi than any of them they arent trying to suppress your rights p
socialism,removed,youre retarded its hard for you to stay on point i see i expect no more from someone who hurls out nazi at every opportunity
socialism,removed,pretty funny how youre trying to make yourself seem like the weak defenceless person who cant protect themselves against the vicious alt right and at the same time youre vouching for autists like antifa who punch women and children in the street and act tough while ignoring images of people clocking them back
socialism,removed,my wifes africanamerican boyfriend goes to a mostly white college im worried for him and all my fellow comrades of color stay strong everyone
socialism,removed,then i guess israel is perfectly reasonably building new towns and cities wherever they might please because borders are arbitrary correct no israeli is illegal
socialism,removed,mein gott the humanity
socialism,removed,antifa at ucberkeley attacked a starbucks because its owned by a jewish guy how are these guys not the nazis here
socialism,removed,encourage people about the benefits of liberalism in your area people usually only do things for their own benefit so suggest one together we will lift the world comrade
socialism,removed,kill your local nazi
socialism,removed,is the leader not contributing more than the average worker
socialism,removed,a national leader should be having all of his needs met and then some its a very stressful and taxing position and as a result you have to keep the person happy throughout not to the kind of excess you see amongst most politicians these days but certainly a high standard of living
socialism,removed,is wealth a zero sum game how do i benefit at all by someone else being fettered
socialism,removed,because he seems hell bent on preventing a labour government from getting into power in the next decade
socialism,removed,anarchocommunist utopia sounds grand but we need to work with what we have right now first unfortunately that is a world were never going to see but at the very least we can put things in motion for future generations going straight from what we have now to anarchy would be a shitshow
socialism,removed,its almost as if being a ceo is more work is a position with higher demand and lower supply and as a result deserves higher pay
socialism,removed,crab mentality this is what happens when you base your economic policy on ideological activism while ignoring economists
socialism,removed,can you post a pic of yourself
socialism,removed,this is one of the dumbest ideas possible pay should correlate as much as possible to the value that somebody produces some people produce near infinite value why should their pay be limited by some random number i suppose this is good if one does not believe in a concept of justice
socialism,removed,implying the poor do
socialism,removed,ive an even better idea take people and let them earn what theyre worth to society o omg
socialism,removed,yes httpsenwikipediaorgwikistevejobs httpsenwikipediaorgwikithomasedison httpsenwikipediaorgwikinikolatesla why should these great inventors have their incomes capped by people who rely on their inventions i understand the need to help people in society and the importance of taxes for benefiting society however to just make punitive taxes is contrary to justice
socialism,removed,see this is not true the creation of a business or a business idea or an invention is itself an invention if you make a business and create millions of jobs and make millions of peoples lives better thats excellent and you are doing more than any one worker by an infinite amount why should you be paid near equally to them
socialism,removed,thats a pretty big oversimplification if the source of business and jobs leave the people this is supposed to help will feel it the hardest
socialism,removed,a capital drain has a negative effect on the economy though and somehow the social benefits structure supporting you and other socialists needs to be refueled but sure fuck rich people yea
socialism,removed,people struggling with motivation and work ethic is something that happens in every place on earth giving our political leaders the resources and tools to overcome these difficulties is not a sign of weakness its a sign of humanity and unless you can personally attest to lenins living conditions his daily diet his exercise regimine you dont really know what makes lenin well lenin
socialism,removed,keep on dreaming mate one day your totalitarian state will be a reality
socialism,removed,has a lot of dprk apologia and the questions are generally run by tankies
socialism,removed,come again
socialism,removed,when you hate people richer than you more than you care for the poor
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,guys all corbyn has to do is swing to the centre the simpleminded proles are scared of the spooky leftists we need more centrist politicians
socialism,removed,make sure to list all the real world examples of this effect
socialism,removed,i see a few problems based on some of the top comments cap the highest wage to some set product of its lowest wage very few people beyond at or near the cap will get there on wages alone investment is the mechanism for producing wealth at the top while labor is the mechanism for producing wealth at the bottom capping labor without capping investment is impotent you will solve virtually nothing corporate salaries will be converted into equity before they bring up everyones pay i dont think anyone will really mind if all the millionaires leave read and let me know if that still stands wealthy people pay into services they rarely use if they ditch the middle class foots the bill the leader of a nation should make no more than the average worker of that nation this is absolutely ludicrous do you want an average worker to lead the nation you want someone educated trained and experienced all of those cost money and a few more things that have been completely ignored in reference to point above if you are capped at a certain total income you have no reason to invest beyond a certain point and are better off spending it frivolously rather than have it taken by the government all investments beyond the cap will be liquidated in a mad dash to get any return on their money causing massive inflation business failure bank failure and the rich sitting on every liquid dollar in existence value is based on a curve of all demand not just low middle or upperclass if you completely remove the entire upper set of the demand curve you fundamentally alter the basis for defining value in goods and services couple this with point and youd see an economic disaster cash reserves as seen from in the states would expand rapidly as corporations would be allowed to sit on cash until policy changes because individuals could not hold any money if you include corporate cash reserves in your cap then you can kiss every valuated business goodbye along with of your corporate tax revenue youd basically be converting every business into a nonprofit organization tldr no more business no more taxes no more services
socialism,removed,i mean ideally wed have a society that doesnt even have money but full communism isnt happening for a long time how would you even determine who gets to live where without money
socialism,removed,those are words i asked for real world examples
socialism,removed,the reason why you dont understand this is why youll never make anything close to it
socialism,removed,im not interested in sidetracking or debating those individual points i asked for some real world examples some verifiable events with names and dates that happened or are happening in the real world that demonstrate your proposed general rule adversity of the rich resulting in gains for the poor because in my experience if things are bad for the rich they tend to be even worse for the poor as for your point about war arms manufacturers and other beneficiaries of war are a tiny subsection of the rich when your country gets ravaged by war most people rich or poor will suffer for it
socialism,removed,aw did the autistic cucks get triggered
socialism,removed,lol rsocialism feebs are so used to being coddled by their corporate jew benefactors that as soon as something slightly different seeps through the cracks they have an aneurysm remind me of those baptists that felt traumatized after janet jacksons wardrobe malfunction same weak sheltered disposition by you bourgeois brats
socialism,removed,why have democracy the vanguard can tell us what to do and they have the guns to force us
socialism,removed,thats great maybe upolciu and other polish immigrants in uk will learn you dont invade other countries with your immigrants especially those who doesnt want you there some may learn some may not
socialism,removed,yeah i have no reason to make myself look even more intellectually lacking than i already have on reddit and so i give you my fare well
socialism,removed,i think we socialists need to step back a minute first of all what have you done to advance socialism or at least some degree of social justice in your country posting on reddit and occupy didnt do shit che guevara posters dont help the proletariat secondly the world will always be capitalist i dont want it to be but unless there is a mass disruption in the world like climate change will likely bring where countries cease to exist than there will always be capitalism you cannot have separate competing countries and expect any form of stability im not saying give up im saying be realistic do you think bernie sanders wouldve gotten the support he did if he was planning on abolishing capitalism in the us what if he just ran for president as an independent green see bernie sanders is what people call intelligent he knows the dem party is fucked he knows the world will never be marxist in the near future but he also is i believe a humanitarian before anything else this is why he is trying to support the most progressive candidates with a chance of winning he can hes made it his life goal to alleviate the suffering caused by capitalism hes voted against our stupid wars violations of civil liberties etc this mentality that because hes not marx reincarnated hes some how an evil bourgeoise overlord he just wants to help working people in the quickest most pragmatic way he can not care about ideology i believe he is a marxist in his perfect world but would rather focus on helping people and bring as much fairness as he can rather than bringing about a revolution that may likely never come just remember why we all were attracted to socialism we believe it is the best way to help humanity we believe it is the only system in which there can be peace equality and sustainability so if someone wants to legitimately make the sufferings lives better than why do we attack them for not being a strict marxist would america not be a better place with free healthcare and education would the world not be a better place without warmongers bombing every inch of the globe i know its cliché but pragmatism is sometimes the best way to help the people who need it the most it doesnt mean you have to surrender your principles we just have to be patient and do what we can when we can
socialism,removed,no sure as shit didnt work for lenin
socialism,removed,i get it man and i dont disagree with any of your points really im just saying sure liberals arent socialists and on the grand scheme of things theyre just as bad as the staunchest capitalist in that the system is never fixed but at least they care about suffering and we can work with that im not even a big bernie sanders fan other than i think id get along with him personally i just dont understand the attacks he receives from the left you make a good point about him runningendorsing the green party still capitalist just less pragmatic than sanders but if it didnt work and hillary lost and donald trump won sanders would have probably felt responsible people think its cute to say clinton and trump are just as bad theyre not you are being willfully ignorant if you think that if anyone has to explain why trump is infinitely worse to you youre being a child sanders saw this and i believe looked at what the democratic party did to suppress his campaign and fully understands third party difficulties to where he could not risk having trump if you saw he did not seem happy about it at all i think if it were kasich or even cruz he wouldve risked taking the chance with green but our country is fucking dumb liberals are stupid babies conservatives are certifiably retarded now we have donald trump very close to the whitehouse the man does not know anything about fuck all he is dangerous people think its funny or not gonna happen but this is how every fascist came to power clinton is terrible but not in the same way she and other democrats will continue the work thats been going on since this isnt ideal but we can deal with it as we have been dealing with it all im saying is ideologies are just that ideas if you cant implement them theyre worthless if you cant point to one way being a socialist has helped anyone youre effectively a capitalist by not doing anything to remedy it so yeah food stamps and a pension arent ideal but theyre better than starvation and homelessness if you removemitigate the class factor in health and education youve done something contrary to what the capitalists want i personally was raised a socialist my parents were from italy and both their parents were communists in italy before and after great uncle was killed by fascists as ive gotten older ive realized my parents and grandparents have done nothing other than feeling morally superior with their socialism they know what needs to be done sure they even did some cool shit back in the day but none of them have done shit in the grand scheme of things because they were too attached to their ideologies if anything didnt fit in their socialist wet dream it was garbage they love to poke fun a the religious sheep but being an ideologue is just replacing religion with ideas ideas are great have them spread them start the revolution but in the mean time people need help and dont have time to wait for it if some liberal corporate or not wants to send poor kids to college where they can learn probably end up being more socialistleftist than when they came in this is why conservatives hate education and grow than im with them if some libertarian wants to close all of our overseas bases and end the wars im with you brother i want peoples lives to get better more than i want my utopian communist society
socialism,removed,awesome news cant wait for the tears on your end lololol
socialism,removed,lol the comment wasnt aimed at you specifically or saying i was more righteous it was meant to be self reflective but since you asked oh so sawant saved the city of seattle from the capitalist swine i missed that you spoke about some ideas and occupied a majority of young idiots who are probably now gonna vote for gary johnson to smoke pot in the street and scream we are the percent cute and that did what exactly ooh you live in a working class neighborhood stick it to the man bet they have a cool hip bookstore huh gotta love gentrification as for myself i was raised a socialist ive worked in africa se asia middle east south america and the pacific as a volunteer nurse with numerous organizations actually saving lives not talking and writing about it ive seen year old sex slaves and child soldiers so forgive me if i dont give a fuck about the newspapers you sold so what are you the feminist going to about the little girls i saw with their vaginas torn up due to constant rape you gonna organize a rally im sure theyd appreciate that meanwhile ill continue give them actual care not trying to be a dick but youve done nothing but make yourself feel better because you think youre some sort of enlightened intellectual sure some americans have it hard but no where near the levels elsewhere in the world the fact youve dedicated your energy to them and not the true victims of capitalism shows your whole world view is based on your privileged american life
socialism,removed,lol kind of off topic but im convinced belichick has molested tom brady when i see them together it reminds me of a movie about romans where some senator has his little boy companion lol so i imagine colin wouldve gotten it up the colon
socialism,removed,cow
socialism,removed,im not trying to defend him as im not a bernie supporter but i feel people often forget what senators and congressman know and dont know when asked to vote especially on war its also important to know who bills are written and often there are many good and bad amendments to any given bill yugoslavia do you understand what was going on in yugoslavia and bosnia etc at the time jesus whos gonna vote against stopping ethnic cleansing libya same thing people were being slaughtered and it was during the arab spring where there seemed to be some hope for change in the muslim world at the time not a great vote but its complicated afghanistan while i believe was the wrong choice i understand and can forgive the vote we were told that taliban supported terrorists attacked us not a damning vote to me and as for funding iraq thats not about agreeing with the war thats making sure troops are funded and have what they need bush was sending in hummers wrapped in canvas in the beginning as for palestine and israel hes a jew who lived in israel and has family there obviously at least a little bias that being said ive never heard a candidate speak about the conditions of the palestinians the way he did and called for redirecting military aid to israel to palestine for economic aid the crime bill is tough because crime in and was insanely high and what we were doing was not working obviously also if youve read the bill there were some gooddecent parts in it the point is he seems to have been more concerned about the causes of crime than anyone else in congress the nuclear waste thing really splitting hairs now it didnt happen so no harm done it was also meant to be small low level things read about nuclear waste and how its disposed of its fairly safe if done properly a lot of antinuclear sentiment is propaganda by fossil fuel companies just because some people in texas protest about nuclear waste doesnt mean they know what theyre talking about really its about context of the vote its easy to say that bill was a disaster years later but as they say hindsight is like i said im not a bernie guy just a facts and context guy
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,zimmerman continued to follow martin around which presumably frightened martin somehow a confrontation started which escalated to fists and like the chickenshit coward he is zimmerman pulled out a gun and ended the fistfight thats murder or at least manslaughter you dont get to start a fist fight and then pull out a gun when youre losing
socialism,removed,the only things stalin did wrong were dying and not khrushchev purged
socialism,removed,yes they are you fucking idiot specificly the communist party so you are saying that its ok to bomb a right wing office but its not ok to do it to the left tbh its not ok at all to blow up shit
socialism,removed,stalin is the reason why communism even exists if it wasnt for stalin hitler would have crusaded against world communism with a burning fury and the us would have helped him the us mostly accomplished what hitler wanted to do anyway but communism survives and it wouldnt be so if stalin hadnt bravely defended it and the gains made by their revolution
socialism,removed,whenever jill stein sounds stupid in an interview i think about this were this guy shows how she was edited to sound like a retard so when oliver shows a clip of her saying something stupid i cant help feeling like there is some foul play
socialism,removed,if you want to destroy the establishment then vote trump if he wasnt antiestablishment then the establishment wouldnt be trying so hard to take him down
socialism,removed,are you stupid or something do you think any one here likes clinton any more than you do
socialism,removed,indeed the only way to overthrow capitalism was to overthrow capitalism and replace it with state capitalism that would hopefully turn into socialism but that ultimately wouldnt because deng and khrushchev even though we dont subscribe to great man theory or anything yeah stalin wouldve built socialism had he lived long enough because he just like really really had the masses and their interests at heart like a lot indeed capitalism wouldve been defeated by state capitalism yes
socialism,removed,how did he assault martin
socialism,removed,but zimmerman had cuts on the back of his head martin had an abrasion on his knuckle and besides a bullet hole no other wounds cases like trayvon martin and michael brown are bad cases to rally around for minority rights since they are so murky
socialism,removed,the holocaust was tragic but i dont know what that has to do with socialism

socialism,removed,as a fascist who frequently browses this subreddit and agrees with many marxist or otherwise leftist critiques of capitalism im going to suffer a quick ban to say that i have the exact same experience as you do most of my friends are mls and anarchists who have kindly decided not to bash the fash when it comes to me i love talking to far leftists because they are almost always heavily engaged and informed on politics and economics and thats really important to friendships for me i dont know i understand that we have massive differences but it frustrates me that we theres so much animosity between our camps even though i understand why its there ive come on the rsocialism discord a few times and had quite a few enjoyable conversations with people despite identifying myself as a fascist too them i know you think all fascists are evil violent and oppressive and i dont doubt that i have ideas and principles that fall under those umbrellas to you but i swear to god when it at least comes to street activism and general face to face interaction i dont believe in suppressing you tearing down your posters attacking you or otherwise violently engaging with you nothing that leftists say do and believe would stop me from being friends with them it saddens me i cant be afforded the same treatment anyways i know ill be banned but i hope someone reads this you guys are cool

socialism,removed,myth
socialism,removed,honestly i see far more antibrocialist rhetoric than i ever come across what you describe i also feel like people who use the term brocialist use it to be quickly dismissive and condescending of someone instead of debating them this would be fine for blatantly ridiculous opinions eg faraltright type stuff but i think immediately denouncing a person or plague as you put it for the opinion that people should unite under class struggle should at least come with a qualification also i dont really know if i agree with terms like brocialist and manarchist anyway theyre clearly gendered insults none of the quotes you posted are even necessarily a male position and seem like they could disenfrachise a lot of men from socialism in general for the record i dont even know for certain what my full opinion is about particular intersectional ideas but i dont think one side is such an extremist position to warrant the purge le brocialists stuff oh and obviously im not defending the things in your post like transgenderism is just a fabrication but peoples ideas of brocialism seem to cover a wider base than that
socialism,removed,downvoted and reported this has absolutely nothing to do with socialism
socialism,removed,what does this have to do with socialism bad cops can only exist in a capitalist regime the quality of this sub is so shit sometimes
socialism,removed,i dont have to refrain from talking about anything especially when a leftcom is taking the side of settler americans over mexicans many of whom are indigenous and suffered at the hands of the spaniards who they eventually threw out and subsequently had their land taken from them by the imperialist americans also lol at white tears in this thread

socialism,removed,heres the thing fuck off
socialism,removed,i have always assumed europe is racist because it is a very traditional continent they do not want foreigners coming in and messing with their culture so when it happens there is a backlash against it like what you are seeing with denmark it is even the same with france where you can become a citizen if you know and show enough of their culture to not be foreign it is less of a skin thing and more of a cultural racism through europe though i mean that is all just subjective observations i have made idk

socialism,removed,i agree so why does socialism need a gun to force them to be kind
socialism,removed,kill the paranoid schizophrenic murder the fuck out of anyone who isnt getting the help they need so we dont look like assholes for not doing anything seriously people this not how you win that man was insane capitalism didnt help him and sub culture used him as a terrorist socialism has a duty to care about people like that because nobody in the universe else does he was still psychologically disabled also if he ever gets out do you think he wont feel justified in his insanity to him whites are oppressed by blacks get funded by some elite mysteriously dropping money into their account and really need to fucking die to stop their rampages you are being had dont be the accidental propaganda department of the fascists because your empathy turns off looking at a madman also no this isnt a race thing there were plenty of insane people shooting at white people too making the struggle of the blm movement fail saying lolz that was ok is not going to convince someone who just wants to earn their bread and not have the streets run with blood which is a sentiment shared by all workers and why the current system endures do not play into the hands of those running the show do you seriously think they are dumber than you
socialism,removed,wow kill everyone why dont you then kill the blm people who got violent kill the worker kill kill fuck that system it does not work its definition of failure there is one way to utterly destroy your enemies make them your friend and show them the error of their reasoning full blown pro holocaust nazis can be reformed i did he is now just another violent asshole who deals drugs and beats his siblings for not giving him a cellphone charger his evil now has no meaning his ideology no strength and his mere survival is a testimony against nazism and its hypocrisy that man was lumpenprolatariat that is how you kill nazis sure the weak must always resort to murder but strength comes from what you can take not what you can dish out strike at the heart comrade we set hearts on fire and snuff them out anything else is just what the bourgeoisie do and it will not win us workers they do not struggle for just another asshole with a gun to loom over them with dead fish eyes
socialism,removed,your argument against that being what come on fellow worker show you are educated not just agitated in germany it was quite common to see the agitated communist run with the nazis next week the worker innately knows this because he deals with radicals daily agitation is a nice way to get cannon fodder but in a civil society with little revolutionary potential all you will achieve is to drive fascist victim narratives there is no breaking point because the balance of power cannot be shifted from the ones who control the society remember the nazis the aryan was the most oppressed most stolen from most lied to most impoverished human on the face of the earth of course he had to strike back for in this wrestling for power he who does not compete doesnt live our only defense against fascism is empathy communication and education sure its feminine but it still looks intimidating on a man the working class knows its women after all the fascist will not allow the power of knowledge in the hands of but a few he will not show kindness to his enemies unless they are strong he will not speak the truth if the truth harms him we can do all these things and while filling up pot holes on the way to progress with bodies is a functional strategy it doesnt work when there are people with something to lose
socialism,removed,there is literally to post about this the one that got locked down because there was a huge disagreement on idek the most that i read all the comments was a lot of people want used violence to extinguish fascism and fascist and some wanted to use nonviolence and were called a liberal but most of the comments i have forgot did someone post this out because the first post got locked and bombarded or is it just coincidence
socialism,removed,yes all fascists were mentally ill hitler too i havent seen any diagnosis beyond a condeming one that shows he was a dedicated fascist fuck off
socialism,removed,hahahaha youre a fucking retarded socialist i knew you were brain damaged
socialism,removed,what does this have to do with socialism i understand that the situation between israel and palestine is a difficult one and that many socialists are active in other political fields but this is a sub for posts about socialism
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,your entire ideology is predicated on cooperation and you cant agree on what you stand for
socialism,removed,then distinguish yourselves every other body of thought has done this already
socialism,removed,good
socialism,removed,good
socialism,removed,why do socialist support the antisemitic hamas israel till communism otherwise stupid people will blame jews for the fails of capitalism
socialism,removed,da fuck theres like police shootings a year blm is definitely not needed
socialism,removed,most peopel in palestine elected the current goverment if there would be states im sure there would be war between these states and you and other socialist have to admit that israel has a special position as a state because the only reason for its existence is to protect jews who are haunted everywhere especially in the middle east by the way i am sorry for my english i try my best to write without mistakes
socialism,removed,antizionism is antisemitism since world war jews need a state where they are the majority they are hunted in every other state so if you think there should be states in conclusion there would be war because palestines are mostly antisemitc just read the charta of the hamas
socialism,removed,so you defend hamas and say they are not antisemitic i read this one httpsenwikipediaorgwikihamasantisemitismandantizionism i am proud to be a zionist as i said there needs to be a state for the jews and this is the form of zionism is support because in other states there will alyways be people who wants to kill jews or wont help them like in i know what the israel lefitist movements says this but thats not argument and i dont think they negate the existence of israel like many socialist do btw its funny that antisemitsm is not in the nos in this subreddit because there is much antisemitism in socialsm especially in germany
socialism,removed,and im in the middle east
socialism,removed,oy vey shut it down
socialism,removed,theres no scientific definition of where life begins and as such theres no definition of where it stops being her body the question is not of if it is life everyone agrees that there is a distinct life the question is of personhood which is a philosophical and not scientific question is personhood achieved at the fusion of eggsperm at birth some point between or as some have suggested only after some phase of childhood development that final criteria has lead to some arguing for legalized termination of postborn individuals who have not yet met certain developmental criteria some followup reading here httpsenwikipediaorgwikibeginningofhumanpersonhood
socialism,removed,only solution to the abortion question is one that remains valid whether the fetusbaby is a person or not otherwise youll be stuck in eternal debate with religious folk
socialism,removed,theres no scientific definition of where life begins and as such theres no definition of where it stops being her body this is a personal problem that the woman alone faces dont these kinda contradict the first admits that the baby might be another person who faces the dilemma doesnt it the nonreligious humanrights concerned criticisms of abortion are dismissed easily because they fundamentally rely on the same logic as religious argument im not sure thats true how is conceding that an unborn child might possibly be a person religious this isnt a subjective question its an objective one that people disagree on
socialism,removed,there are a variety of views on it therefore its left up to the person who actually has to deal with the consequences of the choice all im trying to say is that there might be another person who has to deal with the consequences something which you stated the sentence prior but dont consider the second half of that sentence clarifies what i meant pretty well not exactly abortion isnt exactly a subjective question neither prolife or prochoice people will just say well thats just their opinion will they theres nothing religious about enforcing objective ethics
socialism,removed,you realise the whole race vs race thing is just a lie perpetuates by the media and terrorist groups like black libes matter right
socialism,removed,theres no scientific definition of where life begins and as such theres no definition of where it stops being her body scientific claims are not the only meaningful claims youre on a forum dedicated to taking a positive stance on a political matter after all the nonreligious humanrights concerned criticisms of abortion are dismissed easily because they fundamentally rely on the same logic as religious argument that is the universal imposition of a morality based on subjective belief presupposing moral antirealism will only get purchase with people who know shit about ethics after all the whole point of the socialist rejection of liberalism is imperative for the universal imposition of a morality given the acknowledgement of certain moral claims eg capitalism is bad which is only excusable if moral claims are factual and nonrelative really there are good defenses of abortion appealing to relativism is not only a terrible one its one that endangers the rest of your convictions
socialism,removed,its hard to assert that embryos are not people as people is poorly defined
socialism,removed,the nonreligious humanrights concerned criticisms of abortion are dismissed easily because they fundamentally rely on the same logic as religious argument that is the universal imposition of a morality based on subjective belief as opposed to objective fact and as such theyre refuted by the same arguments but at no point in your comment did you mention anything that was objective cant you say that the abortion argument is based on subjective matter as well in that case what is the objective fact that the prochoice side argues to be clear i am prolife but i do want to better understand a prochoice perspective
socialism,removed,to be honest im not trying to box you into any school of moral thought its just that your comments here display a lack of familiarity with the metaethics of abortion which is the relevant knowledgeset when making any assertion about it for instance the scientific conception on the beginning of life is not and never has been a point of contention in the moral discourse over this topic that matter is trivial fertilization the interesting question is when personhood is achieved or when if ever a developing fetus could gain a right to life that overrides a womans right to bodily autonomy youre correct in that these are philosophical questions but nothing about that fact implies they are subjective on the contrary the overwhelming majority of moral philosophers would strongly affirm the objectivity of the truthvalue of moral claims which moral claims are true is far more contentious there are strong moral arguments for abortion the violinist argument if youre concerned about natural rights and most variants of consequentialism if not everyone should read practical ethics at least once adopting naive positions about the subjectivity of all morality will do little but put you in a position where you cant say anything with conviction
socialism,removed,uhm this article is complete garbage of course men with the capabilities to house a woman for sex will happen its a womans own decision to go along coercion the stupid bitches falling for any of that probably dont know the meaning of the word i dont see societys problem here i see stupid peoples problems here fucking ridiculous reddit is going gah gah for this fb article
socialism,removed,this sounds cool i think this works in the usa too
socialism,removed,rape culture has never actually worked
socialism,removed,the very few times i feel like capitalism is my complacency with exploitation and ruthless oppression
socialism,removed,men forced into homelessness and absolute poverty crickets women invoke her female priviledge and avoid homeless by prostution omg outrage
socialism,removed,but not enough to help the homeless right
socialism,removed,how often to you donate your time and money to the homeless
socialism,removed,it usually is something like if you got an orgasm you liked it therefore you consented individualism isnt about your individual will it is about that hidden personality that is actually you hidden beneath the moral construction of what you think is you by the same logic all commmunists are thieves underneath the idea of an equal society is only the surface and it will inevitably show if we implement a communist society it will regress to barbarism as peoples real intentions surface at the core everyone likes to be raped and rape others so some people actually think
socialism,removed,worth adding that most women cant afford loosing their jobs over this so in the end it will be a small but hopefully loud group and the government will think this over again
socialism,removed,i dont see what would be so bad about losing your top aids
socialism,removed,why is this acceptable but hussein in iraq was shut down is it because theres nothing in it was us other than to stop a mass murderer as if that isnt enough to intervene
socialism,removed,cant tell whats more whack that this elected official boasts his desire to emulate hitler or that the jewish lobby is more offended by a failure to repeat the dead meme than a promise to kill more
socialism,removed,then why is capitalism the best way to launch people out of poverty eg south korea
socialism,removed,oh ya lets see how great socialism is doing in venezuela you dense fool the easy path isnt the best one china has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty since it embraced capitalism many african countries are filled with too many protectionist policies and instabilities to work currently without significant changes still thrir economies are rapidly growing same with india its doing absolutely fantastic poland has been doing very well since capitalism kicked in too look it up communism didnt do a fucking thing for the chinese in poverty the usa is an example of a bad country how fucking naïve are you head encased in concrete and then stuck up your rear so oblivious oh my
socialism,removed,you are mistaken there has been years of that already and venezuela went from a country that used to make its own food and services see pepsico subsidiaries that were expropriated companies like los andes cafe america cantv just to name a few etc that were taken over and are not producing to this day to relying strictly on exports polar is the only company left producing and it is on the verge of collapsing
socialism,removed,the country is about to fail
socialism,removed,best of luck running that factory
socialism,removed,have they been seizing factories and giving them to the workers for years yes they have tens of thousands of workercoops were given grants by the government to run workerdriven factories look it up goes back years and years
socialism,removed,sounds like you should probably fill it out
socialism,removed,toughen up sounds like the paper is there to weed weaklings like you out of the company so either get over yourself or leave
socialism,removed,hahahaha lol youre such a pathetic cowardly faggot who nearly had a mental breakdown over a flyer
socialism,removed,how is that socialist paradise going lol
socialism,removed,lol now there was no change there was no revolution it failed its just a capitalistic state calling itself socialist come on people learn to accept the failure learn to understand that socialism doesnt go much farther than venezuela look i was an anarchist with socialist views once i even participated in student movements and created blogs and online radio stations in favor of socialist views but once i had kids and went out to the working world i noticed that the main issue with socialism is that people have to share the same views for it to work and most of the time it fails in the process of making people share the same views on the other hand capitalism doesnt need people to share the same views to make the economy going i dont have to share your views to do business with you and that is very important to make a system work
socialism,removed,i see no violence here this is just being antisnitch and snitches are a bad thing
socialism,removed,more like sleeping half the people in front of the vz building here are asleep
socialism,removed,what is she homeless
socialism,removed,meh id be down for banned all religious garment id like to ban religion as a whole its pure evil in my eyes
socialism,removed,do you think fascism should be banned
socialism,removed,hey laws are laws if they dont like the laws they can get the fuck out of the country and return to whatever war torn shithole they came from
socialism,removed,its a solution to immigrants coming into a country and not assimilating trying to turn it into the place that they are fleeing
socialism,removed,they dont actively stick them there wanting to live near people like yourself and the economic status of most of these people just leaves very few options racist landlords dont help ghettofication is a huge headache for the government why would they help it along
socialism,removed,they should give up the parts that are incompatible with our soceity like the hate of gays and disdain of women oh and the killrape kuffar parts too just like christianity has left its violent parts behind
socialism,removed,i visit plenty of good communist websites theyre just not in english there is also the problem of a lot of sjw idiots calling themselves left while not even thinking about the problem of capitalism who wants to be associated with the guy covered in shit
socialism,removed,there are numerous branches where gay clergy is not a problem ofcourse there is still progress to be made but theyre way ahead and with the decline of members it will have to change even further or it will disappear and cease to be a problem at all ive never heard of an openly gay imam
socialism,removed,its not police brutality when russia does it
socialism,removed,its not against international laws when a former russian stooge does it
socialism,removed,so what nk is our enemy so this is good propaganda
socialism,removed,seen a lot about this posted what people dont understand is this is the result of a frances own very particular values around secularism the idea being that every french citizen is first and foremost exactly that religous practice is meant to be solely confined to the private sphere and not be involved in the public sphere similar bans apply to the wearing of large crosses etc its not a specific targeting of islam as much as a general attitude to relgion in general admittedly the laws are far from perfect and consistent but to frame this as islamophobia is in my opinion wrong the reason so much tension arises between islam and the french state is due to a specific contradiction between ideas of islamic universalism and french laïcité secularism
socialism,removed,the french state has traditionally played an important role in promoting and supporting culture through the educational linguistic cultural and economic policies of the government and through its promotion of national identity a core part of french culture and one theyve been working to cultivate for decades is that body parts male or female are not inherently sexual and it is completely natural to display them this is incompatible with the muslim idea that the female body is sexual and should be hidden from view another core part of french culture is that public life is secular nonreligious and that when you are in public you are french first no matter what other subgroups you belong to this is incompatible with the muslim tenet that your religion must be displayed openly because the french state enforces french culture the state is bumping heads with their muslim population a vocal minority that refuses to adapt to the culture where they live i think socialism is great thats why im in this sub but france has operated this way for hundreds of years and i think most people hating on the burqini ban must be doing so from a place of ignorance
socialism,removed,america is finally doing the right thing kkkurds are just filthy renegades who are disloyal to assad and the axis of antiimperialism
socialism,removed,whats your nationality youre awfully defensive of the bourgeois modernday white russian
socialism,removed,its the right thing to do erdogan is a bey and friend to the russian federation america may redeem itself of imperialism if it keeps this up
socialism,removed,its the right thing to do erdogan is a bey and friend to the russian federation america may redeem itself of imperialism if it keeps this up
socialism,removed,which one
socialism,removed,kkkurds deserve it erdogan is a friend of tsar putin and must be critically supported against kkkurdih imperialism
socialism,removed,social imperialism is justified imperialism eg when russia does it
socialism,removed,if the french are so culturally secular then why dont these cops take an action to promote secularism this forced unveiling is antagonistic and oppressive which will lead to further rejection by french arabs instead the cops duty here should be to hand the women a pamphlet on the benefits of a secular society and give her his phone number and tell her to call if she ever wants to talk about it and then walk the fuck away and never say a word to her again or something along those lines modern policing is so fucked
socialism,removed,wait what about this is related to socialism
socialism,removed,antisjw is not brocialist i hate sjws idk why the left doesnt realize sjw is a sarcastic term to describe those who dont actually give a shit about any form of liberation except idpol i despise sjws they are a disgrace to the left and before yall get all triggered and downvote me to oblivion because you dont know how to use the term correctly let me tell you that first of all telling people to triggerwarning everything is ridiculous and is trivializing actual ptsd triggers these invented weird genders are stupid too because they assume gender even exists in the first place he she they pick one i refuse to use a weird one because i refuse to acknowledge the existence of gender i use she for linguistic simplicity but i dont identify as any gender because i dont believe it actually exists and do not call me a brocialist because im actually a girl and i am fervently fighting against patriarchal oppression the objectification of women fighting for equal pay and such there is a war against those who dont believe people should be able to do whatever to their body there is a war against the patriarchy what there isnt a war against is this stupid omg you looked at my boobs that is rape idiocy which trivializes rape and this whole liberal ridiculousness that is sjwism sjws are as shit as the cpusa and i hate them brocialists believe that feminism is not needed feminism is needed not fucking liberal sjwism downvote and yell at me to oblivion but i will not budge
socialism,removed,it´s a blatant double standard if you ban the headwear of a religious group to oppose those who force women to wear it you take away the freedom of choice from those who wear it voluntarily just as much as it is taken from those who it is forced upon i don´t know who advocate fascists not having free speech no one i hope if you take away freedom of speech from someone because of their political view you do not take their freedom of speech you take away freedom of speech period
socialism,removed,lol whatever you say someone who doesnt understand terminology
socialism,removed,cool story bro keep supporting those filthy liberals
socialism,removed,lol muslims natural state is to be split from any other group
socialism,removed,you do realize muslim women are not allowed to marry nonmuslims right
socialism,removed,we gave our governments the perfect reason to take our rights by letting them invite in millions of muslims u invited in the paradox of tolerance democracy and freedom checkmate the elite says
socialism,removed,you hate liberalism
socialism,removed,islam is fascism its a political cult that causes nothing but segregation and even within the cult they are segregated the entire doctrine is inherently aimed at expansion and the will to power
socialism,removed,islamophobia is the new blasphemy that once was used by christian fundamentalists to shut up securalists philosophers etc bet theyd wish they had liberals doing gods work like you are doing allahs work lmao who needs jihadists when you got people like you
socialism,removed,bernie has houses keep tellin yourselves hes all about equality youre all useful idiots
socialism,removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch ill have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on alquaeda and i have over confirmed kills i am trained in gorilla warfare and im the top sniper in the entire us armed forces you are nothing to me but just another target i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my bare hands not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it youre fucking dead kiddo
socialism,removed,because forgive the idiom because i know it is a terrible misappropriation of blm used to belittle the targeted killing of black men and women at the core of it all lives do matter or more appropriately life is precious while i dont agree that every life should be equally mourned you can still feel sad for the families and victims yeah white supremacists are the scum of the earth but should we go out and kill them punishment yes murder though i guess i just feel like a more pacified option still exists
socialism,removed,maybe im just paying more attention but i feel like the names of many of the black victims are very well known and fairly decently covered most people probably wrongly view cops as protectors or the word hero is bandied about every now and again and that will generate more outcry than the black targets because they could for the most part always point to something wrong with them as they are getting targeted by police in the first place i think we are in total agreement that it is wrong that the dallas cops are lauded as they are while the actual victims are not as much i just dont think the right course of action is more violence
socialism,removed,did anyone read the article the evidence for him being a white supremacist is nonexistent he like donald trump on facebook and had a iron cross tattoo that every skateboarder who liked independent trucks has probably worn on a tshirt httpwwwindependenttruckscom
socialism,removed,so what gated community are you living in comrade if the cops suddenly stop appearing for work then my neighborhood will quickly become the property of the mexican and salvadoran cartels this sub is infested with keyboard gangsters like you who talk a good game but somehow vanish when shit gets real
socialism,removed,my god the degree of cognitive dissonance here is really staggering all of these year olds in their bedrooms in their gated communities talking about the revolution in such tough guy belligerent language then turning off their laptops and grabbing a capri sun from the fridge get your ass to downtown los angeles after dark and talk to me about what a badass anarchy socialist you are youll be pissing yourself running for your life and dialing simultaneously all these people live in a fucking fantasy world
socialism,removed,bwahaha thats funny i know what you mean my high school flag was the stars and bars nobody really took it seriously but it was part of the old traditions i knew a few light skinned hispanic guys who ended up as hammer skins for a while gang membership isnt about racism usually its more to do with a sense of belonging and just survival in rough neighborhoods the people that im seeing who are calling this police shooting some sort of victory are really bumming me out i was hoping for a call for unity where socialist principles could be enacted democratically not more bloodshed too much to hope for i guess
socialism,removed,there you go with your logic and a historical perspective
socialism,removed,no how do you expect the revolution to happen how many people will have to die in the parts of town where you would not dare travel before youll be satisfied you live in a fantasy world
socialism,removed,its hypocritical we need to know who the racists are that work in the pd
socialism,removed,i think all humans deserve to be mourned no matter how despicable simply for the potential they held
socialism,removed,ok fair enough in terms of the media coverage of the general killings there are the murders that make the news but i know thats indicative of a much larger dataset just to play devils advocate though not every cop killing gers publicized either i am by no means a police or fascist apologist i guess i just have a more pacifist approach before violence i do fear we are approaching a tipping point of racialsocial tension where violence might be necessary
socialism,removed,dont try compassion here this thread is full of violent vitriol and anyone who disagrees with an instant death penalty is down voted
socialism,removed,i personally mourn their deaths because they are all human beings that have been corrupted by either mental disease indoctrination hatred fear or a mixture of those i mentioned we should not celebrated coldblooded murder because this officer was one out of five lives taken by a terrorist this is pathetic that you allow your views to block out basic human empathy and you should take a hard look at how your beliefs affect how you view this world murder is not a thing normal human beings do and we should not celebrate it
socialism,removed,big talk from some neck beard behind a keyboard get over yourself and your pseudomovements you are just an asshole celebrating a murderer who killed completely innocent officers in cold blood go fuck your self buddy
socialism,removed,the good news is ill be retiring within the next years and the socialist get to take care of me with their tax rates i was hoping it would happen sooner so i could retire sooner go back and become a professional college student but at least my advanced years will be comfortable thanks millinials i dont know how youre going to pay for it but im looking forward to it
socialism,removed,then the same can be said for all the blacks spewing antiwhite rhetoric kill them all thats equality
socialism,removed,sanders supporter and real socialist here my esteem of this subreddit just plummeted sanders is just playing politics it takes a real man and a great leader to swallow his pride to compromise in order to effect real change and im no apologist i wholly disagree with his decision to endorse hillabitch
socialism,removed,talking to rpoliticalrevolution might be a better bet
socialism,removed,they look stupid as fuck
socialism,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
socialism,removed,comrades who want to live off of my tax dollars
socialism,removed,that is an insanely oppressive policy so if someone posts or comments something that any of the moderators disagrees with then all they have to do is dig through the offenders history confront them about something that is vaguely contrvetisal and then ban them for it thats nuts if you really care about this sub dont have such a hostile policy towards users there may be many potential socialist activists out there who youve already banned or turned away due to the handling of situations like this people sometimes make comments out of ignorance you shouldnt actively punish people for that
socialism,removed,youre right under socialism all the children would be in the sweat shop yay equality
socialism,removed,or you could just like not go to his speech instead of acting like fucking idiots hes already said ignoring him is the way to beat him but these busy bodies cant help themselves
socialism,removed,the world would literally be a better place for absolutely everyone if all of you ceased to exist
socialism,removed,in order to have democracy you must be able to define your electorate theres no way to do that on reddit its open to participation from anyone then why have we allowed election on here before and why do we have open surveys
socialism,removed,were not fascists were just marxistleninists not that theres much of a difference
socialism,removed,totally apt analogy
socialism,removed,i know stalinists who are angry at the mods here for banning catgirls
socialism,removed,i just wanted to post in this retarded shit show of a sub for the novelty of experience your ban is an honor commies
socialism,removed,i dont know what that stuff is i still just dont see how preventing someone from speaking is a victory for free speech just let him speak most people wont approve because of how regressive he apparently is
socialism,removed,wow ballsy to post those archives under those titles like any of it is true youre a truly toxic presence and a detriment to socialism
socialism,removed,oh look another nonuser of this forum chiming in with an unwanted comment
socialism,removed,people should stop talking about trump and look at this httpimgurcomawfmqn
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,oh people who dont think identity politics wins elections got it thats me
socialism,removed,if you believe that better education will lead people to socialism well you need a better education
socialism,removed,this sub is proof that feminists are fucking delusional cunts
socialism,removed,sigh unzips
socialism,removed,this all seems rather ridiculous did anyone even miss the mods during their strike what were they hoping to prove this is not a real life state this is just an internet forum the worst possible outcome of no moderation for a short period of time is a slight increase in trolls who are either going to be funny or downvoted and some insults
socialism,removed,i honestly want toen believe that the mods are going tot change things but they havent given us any reason tot believe they will especially given the absurd way the leader of the petition was banned this shows just how childish some of the mods are if he wasnt banned for the petition like the mods claim then they sould have no problem with me sharing the original comment here and i encourage everyone to keep sharing the petition until things actualy change greetings everyone im glad this situation blew up because ive been trying to circulate a petition over the recent weeks privately through pms and more personal networking in order to help bring about support for a total rehaul of the moderation of the rsocialism subreddit id like you all to give it some consideration since i no longer trust the moderation of this subreddit to bring about comprehensive enough change to address a situation which i dont think they grasp completely a situation which they themselves created and will attempt to pin on phantom brocialists and reactionaries as it stands the situation current state of moderation policy is of dire consequence to socialism and the spread of class consciousness in general there have been two major events that have been underutilized due to this policy both the bernie loss as well as trumps rise and victory could have been huge moments for leftism on reddit as it stands whenever someone googles reddit and socialism together this subreddit is the first to come up but what do they get when they arrive a huge dose of stalinist repression and most likely a ban sooner or later by the moderators here how many on the fence bernie supporters one day decided to go to rsocialism after a lot of juggling in their head and were banned for this or that nonsensical reason oh yeah those socialists really are all the same the ussr was authoritarian like bourgeois propaganda teaches us and these folks act just like that these authoritarian policies stifle discussion and the stimulation of interest in socialism in general since i stress again that the first google result for people trying to find a reddit community for socialism in general will be led to rsocialism how many possible comrades will be lost through heavy handed moderation that will inevitably link the reputation of the movement as a whole to these self described stalinist moderators not to mention that your reputation suffers heavily across the web most recently exemplified by the rdw video and the completely out of touch reaction by moderator handsomejack who by the way deleted his account to escape public ridicule no doubt by the way bravo on deleting the thread and making it even harder to get anything of use out of discussion just another example of how the policies here are neither transparent nor accessible to the community httpsimgurcomaddbwz are an all too common sight here the policy reform proposals in the petition are simple and as follows but more detail about their implementation and their reasoning • the removal of all current rsocialism mods • the institution of a democratically decided and consistently applied moderator policy • new mod elections to be instituted immediately • the institution of a public and transparent moderation log in the form of a separate subreddit please consider this route and give it some thought we are concerned that the spread of class consciousness on a huge platform like reddit is being underutilized and stunted by these heavy handed policies how many socialists were unjustly banned that couldve contributed positively to the movement we are afraid this happens much too often and our proposals are what in our opinion could be the start of positive change to bring about less sectarianism and properly utilize this space for the advancement of leftism and leftist discussion the time has come comrades to regain control of our space anyone including lurkers who are banned and who would like to add their name to that petition are free to pm me thank you
socialism,removed,how is silencing other people is a triumph for free speech what is free speech for you guys
socialism,removed,i have some trouble believing youre sincere given your post history includes reactionary shit like posting in and comments like go back to
socialism,removed,there are only two genders
socialism,removed,encroaching on basic freedoms wouldnt know anything about that around here 😼
socialism,removed,all user here point being
socialism,removed,you are igoring the whole point he did this as a stunt an act whether to bring awareness at the reality of big pharma or to be a scapegoat for big pharma you have to decide which way you see it except youve already let mainstream media decide for you ill repeat what the comment pointed out so maybe youll make an actual intellectual decision of the drug is given to people that need it for free his aim was to bring awareness basically to be a hero acting as the villains of big pharma but in a completely smug and self publicizedpromoted way like he has been doing its satire an exaggeration his true nature is shown as he gives it away for free to people thats the dialectic what you let happen to you was you let the mainstream media only show you the smugness and all while conveniently not reporting on him giving it away for free to those in need hes literally sticking it up the ass of the insurance companies who along with big pharma and the ruling class are sticking it up the asses of every american hes a charicature of and a simplified view of big pharma ceos another thing you ignored in the comment was that its actually one of the cheaper kinds of the drug so theres all these drug monopolies with higher pricesbut the only ceo demonized and scapegoated the only one that is making himself available for interviews everywhere possible is the guy giving it away for free youve missed the whole point and its so sad tbh
socialism,removed,what if a socialist was going to give an speech and some fascists rioted to have it cancelled i think its scummy both ways dont you agree i think the beauty of free speech is being able to hear both sides you never know who may change your views in the sense that maybe if the socialist in the exemple i gave above was able to give his speech would change the view of the fascists
socialism,removed,this implies that all beliefs are equally valid of course if you say otherwise you might be a fascist
socialism,removed,yes ideas are subjective there is no right or wrong you may agree with one the other both or neither
socialism,removed,the left wing of american politics is a democratic socialist how is that not left wing is socialism nondemocratic
socialism,removed,here is a better article from nyt that this seems sourced from
socialism,removed,lol youre comparing doing something to saying something which are completly diferent free speech doesnt mean youre free to do whatever eg shoving people into ovens it means you can say whatever now i understand why you socialists and communists are against free speech lmao
socialism,removed,lets remember that the nsa is even older
socialism,removed,are they here legally
socialism,removed,the thing to know about this is a specific ideological subreddit
socialism,removed,hmm i wonder why hitler disliked jews so much surely it had nothing to do with an attempted communist coup
socialism,removed,by the standards of the typical internet socialist pretty much everyone in existence has said something imperialist reactionary or biggoted its just that the mod team waits for you to question their leadership or engage in wrongthink before they start the soviet show trials edit appearently insane is ableism this sub is shit edit not really an edit reposing this since i dont know if automod reapproved it or not
socialism,removed,perhaps thats why the dutch socialist party is shit all over europe including the netherlands we see farright racists come to power and still the socialist party isnt making any serious efforts to combat racism and racists
socialism,removed,if a person is blocking the roads why should they be protected by law when they get hit by a car you know because cars belong on roads not protesters
socialism,removed,i removed it it doesnt suggest anything that isnt already being discussed ad nauseum in other threads as such it was decided that it wasnt necessary to have another thread covering the same ground if you want to discuss this please go to the pinned meta thread which this idea has already been posted about and discussed with many other users
socialism,removed,so do socialists
socialism,removed,name a country that socialism has worked in
socialism,removed,when can we see a rsocialism sponsored debate between him and wolff on cspan
socialism,removed,every system of ownership is a system of oppression as long as there is ownership there will always be a reason to go to war or exploit people no matter what system of ownership it is however less wars are fought today than ever less people starve and less people die of disease we are not forced religion down our throat to justify a king we arent hanged just for being gay schools and littracy have helpt us expand our minds and led to many achiving class consciousness it is hard not to get angry when hearing obama saying this very politicly charged statement but when you calm down your emotions and start to think rationally you will see he is technically not wrong if you would seiusly rather live under slavery or feudalism than capitalism i think you are in the wrong sub
socialism,removed,socialism assumes people arent piles of shit thats why it keeps failing we need to evolve before it will work as intended all socialism does now is shift power from the private sector to the political party in charge
socialism,removed,implying socialism isnt democratic pls lurk more u mod
socialism,removed,some preemptive statements before i ask the questions that i want to ask in this thread i am a socialist i do think the police are on balance an oppressive institution of social control i generally side with the party who has been hurt or killed by the cops i expected this video to be a lot different than it was but other than immediately escalating it by yelling i will shoot you which i can sort of understand if the guy is carrying a weapon and you have good reason to believe hell use it instead of stop or something of the sort and other than cuffing him rather than trying to make sure he survives what did the cop do wrong here the actual shooting itself here seems completely justified and i have a hard time believing that the posters here wouldnt have pulled the trigger if someone who very well could be armed was running toward them like that it really is either that or potentially let someone stab or shoot you to death so whats the problem here i dont mean to be condescending but i really feel like many of the posts in this thread are knee jerk reactions and these type of reactions dont help the cause of socialism to be honest it makes socialists look a bit unhinged and thats bad for us
socialism,removed,thats a mighty fine blair quote we have here
socialism,removed,whenever this has been put into practice in communism the means of production has always been controlled by an elite ruling class just because they did not officially own anything did not stop them from making all the decisions just like the owner class in capitalism
socialism,removed,you understand that a socialist society would still have cops right
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,if i have an ideahobby that is profitable why shouldnt i profit from it because youre a shitty person who empathizes with elliot rodgers and tells women to get raped
socialism,removed,yes fascist turned socialist here national socialist ama
socialism,removed,fuck you op and fuck this sub
socialism,removed,i would dispute this tbh but this is such a blatantly petty semantic argument that it almost doesnt seem worth getting into
socialism,removed,even with those that are beating random people for being white im all about completely getting rid of racism but it doesnt seem like theyre going about it the right way
socialism,removed,i hope theres a sniper waiting in the rafters to take them both out
socialism,removed,his intention was to spread terror therefore its terrorism
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,topple the dictator
socialism,removed,some cute girl asked me if i was voting for hillary i told her i would rather kill myself welp guess i wont be getting any wasnt going too anyway though
socialism,removed,they guy stabbing people in minn last week the night club shooting in orlando the dallas cop killer etc etc all immediately labelled terrorism
socialism,removed,yes they do how could you even i dont even
socialism,removed,am i the only one to find this pic uncomfortable lenin not as bad as stalin was a piece of shit
socialism,removed,this is absolutely a terrorist act driven by his apparent nazi beliefs i would also attribute the same reasoning to terrorist muslims and their beliefs
socialism,removed,desperate times need desperate measures accelerationism belongs there i like it actually
socialism,removed,she is a hyper liberal who thinks the linch pin of patriarchy is video game boobs not capitalism
socialism,removed,they do when its political expedient for them
socialism,removed,sometimes a muslim inspired by the socalled is are branded terrorists despite their lone wolf credentials
socialism,removed,this was like a great statesman
socialism,removed,their prime minister modi is now treated like a great statesman title is redundant lmao
socialism,removed,you cannot paint an entire faith because of the gujarat riots and massacre
socialism,removed,good i hope it died screaming now we just need to get rid of the rest of them
socialism,removed,they always imply terrorism if its done by a muslim though they also indicate a search for ties to isis
socialism,removed,right where it belongs
socialism,removed,hello hippies
socialism,removed,people who are among the best at what they do get paid more than their peers how weird right
socialism,removed,gtfo you wannabe communist bastards
socialism,removed,this is not true at all most people at rshort can confirm this if wimen have lot of options they would alwats choose only the top men in terms of looks to have sex with this is because women do not mind sharing a man becauae if her inatincts who tell her to have sex only and inly with the alpha male wonen are still mammals
socialism,removed,the title is clickbait shit if you read the article the property in question was the cash when she left without consent it became a thief not that use deadly force to recover is any more sane
socialism,removed,fuck you asshole no really fuck you what you are implying here is not that israel as a state or the government of israel has to cease existing which is a broadly if debatable communist position but that the people in israel their very existence are the problem thats eliminatory antisemitism asshat and not i dont accept this as you know what i meant you knew exactly what you were writing
socialism,removed,he shot her because she stole his money after refusing sex its a stupid title and she didnt deserve to die either
socialism,removed,i want you to think about the questions i posed i dont say that this is some variant of antisemitism it might well be but it is at least questionable why israel is so much more important than other states and regimes how much did you hear for example about the crimes of the assad regime which i use as an example because it controlled a neighboring state for decades compared to the real and imagined crimes of the israeli state ever heard of the assad sr regime murdered more people there in one month than the israeli state did in both intifadas put together ever heard of it ever heard jill stein or anyone else call for a boycott of syria before go figure
socialism,removed,yeah finally this has of course not been going on for at least years since the six days war facepalm people who think that they are breaking taboos while saying stuff that has been part of left rhetoric for decades should ask themselves if they are just uninformed or maybe victims of antisemite stereotypes
socialism,removed,if she walked out the door without the money and he shot her he would have gotten a life sentence right if so it wasnt about refusing sex implying as this headline does that texas law allows killing escorts who refuse sex is exploitive on the part of gawker and probably dangerous this law is absurdly horrific because it values money over human life there is plenty enough to be angry about without distorting the issue
socialism,removed,enjoy your globalism and being run by a oneworld government after all when has communism ever successfully dissipated the state
socialism,removed,one thing ive noticed in rsocialism is a tendency to have lots of discussion critical of bourgeois feminism—women ceos lolol— but whenever theres an opportunity to engage in discussion about and develop proletarian feminism the silence if deafening exactly this i had to yell at the mods in rsocialism carrot chat for a full half hour yesterday to get them to actually ban someone concern trolling about eeeeeevil bourgeois college campus feminists undermining solidarity he is back in their chat now and i am banned for attacking him i was mean they desperately need a cultural revolution of their own
socialism,removed,lmao hey meedina i was actually wondering do you remember greykos other account name the one he was banned under yesterday i think it was theturbo with maybe starting with a d
socialism,removed,you are not alone in thinking unions dont do much for you in the blacks were forced to join unions that supported jim crow laws some unions have basically become a way for the capitalist class to channel anger and dissent into a mode that keeps workers in poverty check out the socialist equality party they are a party that advocates the direct control of the means of production rather than through unions
socialism,removed,just like how its won in laos or venezuela
socialism,removed,so theyre eating dogs because venezuela is still too capitalist why have the citizens of fully capitalist nations not been reduced to eating dogs
socialism,removed,i like how socialism has been attempted dozens of times now and has ended with misery and death every single time socialists are basically the same as alcoholics and gambling addicts just one more drink just one more bet just one more attempt at socialism
socialism,removed,if trump becomes president we are on the road toward a new civil war it wont be much of a war considering the metric fuckton of firearms we have to use against your sticks and stones
socialism,removed,good luck were armed with actual firearms not the fucking sticks and stones you losers employ as weapons and wont hesitate to use lethal force in defense of our lives if you want to take a nato round through your heart for throwing rocks at trump supporters thats on you we wont start the fight but you better believe well fucking end it employ violence against us and youre liable to lose your life in the process youve been warned
socialism,removed,well one could hope that we could get them most of them to immigrate to voat or something along the lines of that do you not realize that reddit was up until recently what voat currently is reddit was in fact founded as a bastion of free speech and only became a safe space for the left after being purchased by liberal media giant condé nast reddit was our safe space so to speak and you fuckers invadeddestroyedpillaged it like the cancer you are if we moved over to voat its not like you would allow us any peace over there you would end up infecting voat as well
socialism,removed,remove non elites so the world population is comprised of elites
socialism,removed,while being opposed by the us imperialists you mean the us imperialists that buy of their exports and provide of their imports was that wrong should we not have done that
socialism,removed,they cancelled all elections indefinitely i think that makes them a dictatorship
socialism,removed,they have nationalized of the largest nonoil businesses in venezuela food cement electronics steel textile chemical fertilizer glass tourism banking insurance and of course oil those are not a few key industries those are all the industries now they are defunct and venezuela starves
socialism,removed,so your solution is just to let them all starve in the name of socialism
socialism,removed,maduro has indefinitely cancelled all elections in venezuela he imprisons political prisoners he released some today how is this not a dictatorship
socialism,removed,and we will flush them out there the answer is not to allow them a forum fool
socialism,removed,bullshit since when is identifying criminals and illegal behavior banable
socialism,removed,we need this information out there clear proof the corporation is trying to fake violence so the police can open fire disgusting
socialism,removed,tired old identity politics having its last hoorah it was clear to anyone paying attention that this type of politics had become a diversion from class based politics by the eighties or earlier but it was not until the that the neoliberal project took it up its colorsthe united colors of benetton sanders was an attempt to rescue the democratic party from this but the democratic party was already too far gone now we know
socialism,removed,you are now a brocialist noncomrade
socialism,removed,looking at trumps economic plan i could not in good conscious vote for jill stein it will begger america while enriching the hillary is a cunt but trump will be a disaster
socialism,removed,i frequently read rsocialism and its currently on the front page
socialism,removed,socialism has nothing to do with the other or so words youve just put up there next to it we want to end commodity fetishism not debate it
socialism,removed,can we not let this comments section devolve into racism against cuban americans i am tired of seeing leftists characterizing all cuban americans as reactionary batista sympathizers many users on this sub are cuban american including myself and would like to see an end to the stereotyping please
socialism,removed,fuck fidel castro fuck socialism and certainly fuck this sub
socialism,removed,defending them isnt worth a second of our time as socialists im new to this sub and confused are you serious or is that some sort of irony
socialism,removed,even though a lot of them have reasonable arguments they seem to have a tendency to get to angry to make their point sp ajcry the problem is that too often they become angry on silly or petty things or at best not the most important things income inequality and say bathroom rights for transgenders are both issues but one of these two is way bigger of an issue than another still that stereotypical tumblr warrior would happily spew hate on the question of bathrooms but wouldnt care much about the income thing and again that bathroom thing is at least a real issue theyre too happy to make a fuss about unissues too unfortunately
socialism,removed,yeah i picture my stupid ex girlfriend who spent most of her time on facebook raising awareness about things in other words she reposted other peoples opinions without researching them to all her friends that already shared that opinion
socialism,removed,first thats racist denying people of your support based on their skin color how nice second you do realise that there are other countries besides the us right i really hope youre some random troll
socialism,removed,he owned a butcher shop how awful
socialism,removed,im pretty sure usituationistprank isnt part of the bourgoises
socialism,removed,you cant procommunist arguments are retarded
socialism,removed,i dont see anything wrong with that to be honest people criticize christianity all the time why does a religion that compels some people to terrorism get a pass now listen im preparing for all the responses i will get but i want to have a sincere and open dialogue among leftists about the refugee crisis i dont see how the united states is under any kind of obligation to take in these refugees especially since they have a horrible track record in terms of committing terrorist attacks and other crimes in the nations that take them in these people do not have a right to be in the us its a perfectly reasonable policy to refuse anyone entry into the us based on their geographical origin if the people from that origin have a record of bringing in crime were seeing it in europe and were seeing it in america many of these people cling to an antiquated and oppressive ideology that is incompatible even with western liberal values they are antiwomens rights antilgbt etc why let them in what purpose would this serve yes these people have been victimized by capitalist and imperialist governments but that doesnt give them the right to come into our countries and not assimilate cling to views we consider reactionary and oppressive and open our cities up to more terrorism i suppose the big thing here is whats the solution what should we do
socialism,removed,hey guys come over to rcommunism before you accept and please keep an open mind
socialism,removed,tbh though islam is seriously fucked antiwomen etc way more than any other modern religions
socialism,removed,tip your fedora
socialism,removed,this is just sad you bring up race and gender and are so eager to deny your support to those who do not match your criteria meanwhile socialism is not about sex or race and never was you have marx flair so let me quote from marx the communists are distinguished from the other workingclass parties by this only in the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat independently of all nationality in the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole for a marxist there are no blacks and whites but theres working class and those who exploit it dividing working class to blacks and whites to cishet and uh whatever is the antonym for that instead of uniting them helps no one but those who exploit said workers while not being a marxist myself i completely agree with this particular stance
socialism,removed,rmuhcoops
socialism,removed,sure but communism has never worked will probably never work i have always held the belief that communismsocialism is great in theory we can strive for it in an ideal world but sadly in practices it will suck the must out of most people with any ambition or they will move abroad thats one reason america was the home of the smartest people after wwii and soviet was left behind greed fame and status drives people ill be honest if i knew that working as a barista would earn me the same benefits and living condition as the doctor who spent years educating himself yeah id go for being a barista a lot easier i am a christian and i believe communism is fine in theory but i also am a realist and understand that humans are assholes fidel castro is a fine example a man who stripped his people of all their properties while he himself lived a luxurious life at the cost of his own people living poverty
socialism,removed,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium
socialism,removed,also id like to point out everyone downvoting me i dont really care about my reddit score but its hindering my ability to answer fast enough since it has put a restriction on how much i can post thats sad to be honest i have not insulted anyone i have been polite i have only come in here to debate and learn challenge my view of the world instead of silencing me through internet points if you wanna have a circlejerk where no one will debate you on your view of the world you can ask me to leave but id like to learn and debate with people who do not share my personal belief that is how i learn and grow thank you
socialism,removed,i cant figure out which one of you guys are worse the he didnt kill tons of people to fuel is tyrannical regime or he was justified to fuel his tyrannical regime
socialism,removed,i dont think there is a pure capitalist country but the difference is we have seen mixed economy work in europe and in america chile is a country that has grown immensely since going from socalism to mixed economy basically mixed economies have been successful in their own right socalism or communism has not worked anywhere there is not a single socalist country that can even compare to the worst of a european country or if there is please enlighten me yes there is countries that has failed with mixed economies i am not arguing against that but we have also seen the system work
socialism,removed,you are literally as in literal meaning of literally are reading in my words the opposite of what i wrote there i quote from marx the communists are distinguished from the other workingclass parties by this only they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat and you reply with stop being a brocialist who purports to help only one section of the working class how am i even supposed to argue with you if you disregard what i just said so easily and assign me the views which are the opposite of what im holding
socialism,removed,the prerequisite to accomplishing class consciousness for the entire proletariat is overcoming the barriers of racismsexismableismetc i wholeheartedly support this and let me tell you supporting some parts of your countrys working class like those who are economically underperforming blacks or latinos and calling the others deplorable white male scum as in this thread above is not only literally racist but also alienating af ant thus is not how you achieve your goal im not in the us and how easily you guys replace the class conflict with the race conflict even those of you who say they are socialists poor white working man and poor black working woman have more common interests than the said poor white man and some white male millionaire but somehow you guys tend to forget that
socialism,removed,i guess my reply would work for your comment too
socialism,removed,youre denying the particular problems faced by female proletarians lgbtiqa proletarians and proletarians of colour i did not deny anything its you who are assuming that i do quite nice of you isnt it who do you think i am a trump supporter come on im not even in the us quite the opposite for me its sad how you guys are happy to deny any support to some parts of your countrys working class based on their gender and skin color and find ok to call them names this is racist and also wrong this is what i wrote in this thread above and not the things youre accusing me of
socialism,removed,why shouldnt he be able to go to colleges and talk about his ideas isnt that what college is for
socialism,removed,why is inequality bad the only reason someone works hard is to create inequality
socialism,removed,is anything non prosocialism instantly removed guess we will see what of socialist believe raising the minimum wage wont raise the price of other goods not here to argue just to see a show of hands
socialism,removed,yeah fuck the pope and fuck anyone who wants to suck his holy dick
socialism,removed,aside from the sheer lunacy that he spews everyday i hate that he uses twitter like this this is not like fdr with his fireside chats its complete unedited unthought out garbage yeesh have some fucking tact baby president man
socialism,removed,as someone who served in the military and believes that america can be that shining light im not down with flag burning and would never do it myself but either were a free country or we arent you cant have it both ways
socialism,removed,im going to have to play devils advocate and remind everyone that a lot of people are really scared right now the very ones that we are trying to agitate against are the ones that have agitated the general population into the frenzy that lead them to elect trump we cant forget that instead of agitating more putting cup against citizen and alienating ourselves further let us attack the situation not the badge or the centuries of oppression it in our eyes represents we need to let the general population know that we do indeed stand with the police provided that the police are truly enforcing values we agree with right now they do not but the general population does not see a difference between not supporting the situation as opposed to not supporting police we need to further define those lines and once that is accomplished we will win
socialism,removed,imo its that kind of rhetoric that push people away from us what about police in a socialist state you cannot really believe that literally all crime and the like will disappear under socialism thats unrealistic the sad reality is that police are a necessary evil but if you redefine what it is they protect and serve which right now i agree w you is a bourgeoisie agenda then problems going forward will be minimal not absent but minimal
socialism,removed,these people are lying to you cuba is a democracy as much as north korea is batista and castro were both dictators and the world is a better place with dead dictators
socialism,removed,but as cops they are by definition in direct opposition to the socialist cause see now this is where i agree and disagree at the same time right now as it stands i agree that police are being used as a tool to oppress many things not just the socialist cause however it doesnt have to be this way and we shouldnt look at it with the perspective that this is the way it has to be when conversations like this arise we must champion the cops as individuals are not bad people but then continue with but some of them do bad things how do we correct it this i think makes both parties happy as we are not pushing away the general public who we need nor the police as a whole who we need but rather we are saying that there is room for improvement and we think we have the best solution to make everyone happy
socialism,removed,mobile is a pain that being said while i am in agreement that anarchy is the end goal realistically speaking we as a society across the globe are a long way from being able to get rid of government all together that will take generations and i think even at times i underestimate the damage capitalism and its predecessors have done to human nature so while i agree with you in a bigger picture anarchy down the line i disagree that well be able to dissolve the state in our lifetime and we should focus on the stepping stones well need to get to in order for future generations to achieve it
socialism,removed,because irrespective of any good he might have done he was also a warmongering dictator whose actions contributed to bringing the world to the edge of annihilation not to mention an appalling human rights record or little things like quashing freedom of speech and freedom of the press sure no reason to not like the bloke there right
socialism,removed,i seem to see some major hypocrisy here am i to believe that fidel castro would have tolerated people burning the cuban flag i am trying desperately for someone to explain a socialists stance on freedom of speech and control of dissent from the government please someone explain it to me
socialism,removed,therefore if someone disagrees with pure equality then they are not for the people or by the people for the people by the people relates to the elected representatives of the people who stand for the people of their constituency having been elected by the people of their constituency ie a representative democracy it has nothing to do with pure equality the very notion of which ludicrous purely and simply because we arent all born equal some are smarter faster stronger prettier etc than others equality should go as far as to try to reach equality of opportunity be the best you can be but any further than that only results in raising up the lacking and oppressing the worthy
socialism,removed,classic fascism to squash dissenting opinion
socialism,removed,i feel like i am viewing things as they are though as it stands now and in the foreseeable future as far as im concerned without the police we are going to lose a revolution on american soil and even with it will be a long difficult road generations before us have been distracted and with that distraction the bourgeoisie have grown strong and have given their enforcers the tools to keep us oppressed what they i feel have neglected is the fact that many of those enforcers are workers in and of themselves and are too being oppressed in one way or another once we convey that message in a non alienatingself destructive manner not only will the police come to us in numbers we couldnt have anticipated but rather the general population as a whole will come in full force
socialism,removed,what does he think america is cuba venezuela north korea some other socialist country
socialism,removed,we should consider the possibility that he isnt careless but instead quite calculating and profoundly manipulative seriously just imagine for a moment that comments like this arent off the cuff blunders but conscious ploys to bait the media and shape the political landscape in his favor its far from impossible and just think of the kind of danger we are all in if thats the case this is basically the assumption upon which i now operate i think the risk of deluding myself into a false sense of security by believing trump is just dumb and reckless is way to too high
socialism,removed,tfw castro has caused tens of thousands of people to flee cuba because of his violent and oppressive regime then a subreddit of people try to find a way to pretend like he was actually a good leader in order to stand out and appear informed
socialism,removed,i mean he can talk but he cant vote i agree with the sentiment but come on dude
socialism,removed,if they had made one would you not just insult them and say that its not enough
socialism,removed,are you trying to impose your will on me
socialism,removed,i will on november
socialism,removed,idiots who spout that need to be on the wrong end of a noose specifically the blunt noncircular end having been tied around a pike and impaled through said idiots
socialism,removed,what a very mature and normal sentiment people with that kind of logic are definitely the type i would trust to run my country s get it together this is real life not a joke be an adult
socialism,removed,and youre an adorable little piece of gulagbait
socialism,removed,strikes are one of the most effective weapons for workers if not to reform to send a message to bosses that it is workers who hold the real power
socialism,removed,will you be protesting dnc corruption
socialism,removed,edgy
socialism,removed,these people honestly seem more concerned with fighting white privilege on an individualist scale as opposed to organizing to smash the white settler colonial foundation upon which that privilege springs forth from the former requires collective struggle along revolutionary lines and a fight for selfdetermination for oppressed people in the country
socialism,removed,why who would work retail or be maids or farm hands why doesnt everyone deserve cushy well paying jobs
socialism,removed,holy shit are you guys for real save this comment so you can see how retarded you all are come the
socialism,removed,what are you protesting
socialism,removed,great idea all for it sort of in a key position so i wont be able to actually strike i have to be in the office but im gonna do everything halfassed promise
socialism,removed,because its nonskilled labor
socialism,removed,peaceful proteststhe police didnt do anything to deserve violence
socialism,removed,how is it fascist when he was elected on top of that he has no previous indication that you can look at that would show he is an actual fascist he flipflops on everything and everyone and even flipped today on repealing the aca none of this makes sense
socialism,removed,hell yeah now whats the end game whats our goal surely showing the government heads were just a bunch of ass pained cry babies cant be the conclusion to this wonderful and revolutionary idea
socialism,removed,to strike at work requires a job kinda important
socialism,removed,im sorry but what are we protesting
socialism,removed,i know ill get hate for this but the last thing that we need to do is divide this country any more than it already is i voted for hillary too but trump won and americans need to help him succeed because theres nothing we can do now to change the fact that he won
socialism,removed,why dont you just grow up
socialism,removed,lol how old are you people or should i say young
socialism,removed,you commie faggots need to get a life
socialism,removed,people downvote but yall know half the strikers will be out there for this reason and this reason only
socialism,removed,soros
socialism,removed,so you can call the cops or what
socialism,removed,lol how stupid do you have to be to recommend this to newbies
socialism,removed,youd think hed take advantage of his situation mr chomsky you have a long and storied history of critiquing american politics and denouncing its system what do you have to say for id vote for hillary
socialism,removed,what a bunch of crying babies who have never had a hard day in their lives and have grown up with everyone gets a trophy the forefathers and the great men who made this country great would turn you baby asses over a knee and give you a much needed spanking like your weak parents should have done when you were children
socialism,removed,lol settle down
socialism,removed,ight but he wasnt backing her he talks all the time about how our government on both sides are shit shrinking him down to id vote for hillary is wildly disingenuous to what noam has done and what he actually said
socialism,removed,the united states is extremely lucky that no honest charismatic figure has arisen every charismatic figure is such an obvious crook that he destroys himself like mccarthy or nixon or the evangelist preachers if somebody comes along who is charismatic and honest this country is in real trouble because of the frustration disillusionment the justified anger and the absence of any coherent response what are people supposed to think if someone says i have got an answer we have an enemy there it was the jews here it will be the illegal immigrants and the blacks we will be told that white males are a persecuted minority we will be told we have to defend ourselves and the honor of the nation military force will be exalted people will be beaten up this could become an overwhelming force and if it happens it will be more dangerous than germany the united states is the world power germany was powerful but had more powerful antagonists i dont think all this is very far away if the polls are accurate it is not the republicans but the rightwing republicans the crazed republicans who will sweep the next election –
socialism,removed,you guys are doing exactly what you say you hate
socialism,removed,im imagining you would need a job for anyone to care
socialism,removed,i thought the image was just a joke maybe you guys should make it look better
socialism,removed,his social policies are of course shit but the pope praising communism is nonetheless a big deal
socialism,removed,because they do a brainless job a monkey can do i currently work in retail
socialism,removed,just a question what do you guys plan on accomplishing
socialism,removed,most of them dont go to school or work anyway
socialism,removed,orange and passion fruit is my favourite
socialism,removed,that first part of your comment is exactly why its their own fault trump won and theyre being children about his win show up to vote next time if you actually care
socialism,removed,realistically this will achieve nothing it will only make things worse and encourage the police and other forces to be even more aggressive and authoritarian than before
socialism,removed,ok neosoviet unions
socialism,removed,we learned this year that facts do not matter why not muddy the waters
socialism,removed,cringeanarchy
socialism,removed,nothing is injustice about this past election people are insane and delusional what is not going to school going to accomplish
socialism,removed,half you motherfuckers dont work anyway so i highly doubt the effects will be felt
socialism,removed,leftcommunism bordiga to all the newcomers please dont
socialism,removed,they also have devices to pick up brainwaves so its best if you wrap a layer or two of tin foil around your head so they cant read your mind
socialism,removed,cool so you strike but what are you asking for i havent seen this question answered reasonably in any modern movement it has to be specific really specific or send this over to
socialism,removed,if a picture of a guy with a mask and a flair is too scary for you then just stay in your college campus safe space the marshmallow left is dead
socialism,removed,get back to work you lazy pricks
socialism,removed,no socialism is a conservative trap because it is an impossible ideal and even if people are organized behind asking for more social programs it doesnt bring many jobsincome back it is not possible to convert to full socialism from capitalism basic income is the first step in addition it is the least easy social program to dismantle because everyone gets the same amount of money and with appropriate taxes it is possible to fund both basic income and the other public institutions especially with the increased tax revenue from all that spending converting to socialism starts with basic income i dont see any other alternative
socialism,removed,hillary didnt win so repeating a similar history has been averted
socialism,removed,you arent going to do shit pussy
socialism,removed,if you think this is going ro be like youre a retard
socialism,removed,literally nothing compares to the revolutionary zeal expressed by writing comments on an irrelevant internet page for teenaged nerds
socialism,removed,sorry i just actually know what fascism is and can tell you this wont be anything close to fascism sorry im not brainwashed by staying in an echo chamber of regressive ideas my whole life
socialism,removed,sure the problem is that it takes a narcissistic douche like assange to run something like that either that or a bureaucrat without a soul dude gets threatened with drone strikes by people who can actually make good on those promises
socialism,removed,i know what you mean its a ropey and tldr but basically king leopold was a cunt
socialism,removed,that much cocaine could kill a lot of people in a variety of ways and maybe some in that network did
socialism,removed,whyd you downvote me you cucks
socialism,removed,thats not how an economy works you cant just dictate that
socialism,removed,so how will new things get invented how will we become more efficient
socialism,removed,huh people dont act much out of the kindness of their heart
socialism,removed,libertarian shouldve clarified my apologies
socialism,removed,huh people want it but nobody wants it enough for themselves to be able to go through with inventing it
socialism,removed,tragedy of the commons
socialism,removed,he who lives by the sword is destined to die by the sword socialism has to be democratically legitimate or it is not legitimate at all
socialism,removed,okay this is why economists dont take socialism seriously
socialism,removed,abolish nafta take jobs from people dont pay taxes give them to impoverished people who do get us out of wars we dont belong in put america back to work keep the common man armed and employed establish and maintain control of our southern border not accept new immigrants from destabilized region where documentation is sketchy and there are known to be terrorists temporarily not accept new immigrants from certain groups who represent a unique threat to national security while in every way preserving the rights of the taxpaying citizens who are already here not subordinate our needs to those of china and syria knowing that this is the nature of all politics definitely a fascist naw i think the clear choice is the naftaendorsing secondamendmenthating serial killer whos too incompetent to pour herself a fucking beer
socialism,removed,yes and it would be foolish to expect anything more from bourgeois election than to test the waters and see if we can make the us go beast mode again for the next years remember gwb thats why we vote for hilary and look elsewhere for the change no president could bring about anyway we had a good run with bernie maybe next time but in the meantime we have much more important things to do by supporting leftists downticket
socialism,removed,ill do it i will be the asshole if you are working a minimum wage and cant afford to take care of yourself you should not have a child get your shit together first too many people have kids too early and play the family card like the world owes them an easy life
socialism,removed,ill be laughing when clinton loses reelection in and drags the entire democratic party down with her in the downballot races resulting in republican gerrymandering of the congressional districts being strengthened after the census year and democrats not regaining control of the house of representatives until at the very earliest honestly hillary clinton is probably the worst thing that could have ever happened to their party i actually legitimately hope trump wins if only for their sake
socialism,removed,whoa one of the most regulated markets in the usa is causing big problems we need more regulations
socialism,removed,tell me whos gonna force them to adhere to their standards should we tax the same people who are blatantly breaking these regulations on a constant basis while they continue to lobby for these very same regulations to stop natural competitors nice downvoting there too lots of freedom in this place how oppressive you guys are towards speech to coddle sensitive feelings god i feel like more and more people are gonna wind up more autistic than i am
socialism,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikirentcontrolintheunitedstates this fucking subreddit wilfully blind lmfao
socialism,removed,of course cut back regulations that actively suppress competitors from entering the market
socialism,removed,its not like the community wouldnt be involved lol the whole point of socialism is that the workers and the community come together to create and distribute productsservices to people since we would be planning the economycomputers or noit is silly to think we wouldnt come up with neat nifty or random spurts of creativity its an inherently human thing to do when we organize and create things and focusing on profits actually harms the strive for it tbh acting like we cant compute our way out of things like that when we already have programs doing outrageous is also kinda wrong imo if you want though to argue about whether or not money is a good thing to use to foster creativity vs other things we can go over that tho

socialism,removed,heres my unpopular opinion not voting for hillary means that youre in a very privileged position where you dont have to worry about what would happen if trump was actually president its horribly selfish to be completely honest i can understand not wanting to sacrifice your ideals but the fact of the matter is that not voting or voting for some obscure third party gives trump a better chance of winning your obscure third party isnt going to win and there arent nearly enough self proclaimed socialists or communists or anarchists or whatever who would vote for said third parties to even give them the tiniest shred of publicity what youre saying when you say i will not sacrifice my ideals to vote for the lesser of two evils is i am in a privileged enough position where it does not matter to me
socialism,removed,the police literally did nothing wrong its never the policemen themselves to blame
socialism,removed,more social democratic policies from rsocialisms favourite social democrat
socialism,removed,this actually hurts their cause more than anything else people who cheer for these actions are idiots i am firmly against the work reform law and have rioted against it but this has gotten way out of hand from breaking into and ravaging a hospital to throwing molotov cocktails on police people doing their jobs fuck these idiots
socialism,removed,i bet hillary is not necessary
socialism,removed,worker ownership means nothing without that abolition of capital no it still improves many many lives what accomplishes nothing is a childish allornothing mentality
socialism,removed,demsoc logic basically accepts compromise in the senate for more that years
socialism,removed,remember when the greens were colluding with the other races not just the presidential election
socialism,removed,agreed id rather have a semifascist as president
socialism,removed,you only get banned if you post to subs that has committed doxxings and harassment except nobody was doxxed somebody posted a picture of themselves in the rsocialism discord and then somebody stupidly made a meme out of it stupid absolutely harassment maybe doxxing thats a bit over the top
socialism,removed,im okay with him supporting hillary because shell be far less damaging to the far left movement than a full blown fascist and bernie realizes that plus she supports whats popular for the most part so she will probably pass at least some far left legislation
socialism,removed,libertarian here so i can see where you are coming from i would love to be an anarchist but im too pussy
socialism,removed,basically in australian media in regards to millenials not being able to afford a house a shit cunt of a columnist stated that millenials cant afford their first home because they eat too much smashed avocado sandwiches at cafes
socialism,removed,please choose the lesser of two evils an abstention is a vote for trump please please please vote
socialism,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikigreatpurge
socialism,removed,they were targeting gays and trannies and stuff not sure how they lasted so long tbh
socialism,removed,my friend tried arguing with me that nazis of hitlers party were socialist because they were called national socialist german workers party i read more into it to make sure i wasnt insane and it basically said that their ideology was neither right or left but a mix
socialism,removed,yeah being consistent makes me retarded now
socialism,removed,is he wrong
socialism,removed,europeans certainly saw themselves as separate from asians and black people western civilization also conquered most of the world and developed much more technology than the rest of the world most inventions are from the western world
socialism,removed,its almost like a historical echo of the heights of socialist papers had a socialist uprising
socialism,removed,europeans absolutely saw themselves as a group that was more civilized than outside groups there was a sense that they themselves were separate from the rest despite them having divisions between themselves and is ability to conquer how we measure civilization its a pretty informative measure and going by technology progress you get the same results everyone borrowed some technology from other groups doesnt change the fact that the western world has dominated the world its really blatant and its been that way for hundreds of years
socialism,removed,fucking woodrow the real traitor of the left annndd then he was governor
socialism,removed,fucking woodrow the real traitor of the heights of socialist papers had a ton of socialist papers had a pretty easy place to instigate socialist ideas
socialism,removed,he was a rather militant point in utah that account for its percentage
socialism,removed,jesus even then percent of the country was retarded
socialism,removed,idaho is the pride of the heights of socialist papers had a pretty nasty racist even for his day and age

socialism,removed,ah i didnt know the annual cuckold convention was taking place then
socialism,removed,seems strange this is posted in rsocialism when the hammer and sickle is explicitly communist also didnt the soviet union enact strict gun control in finally they are implying that a white lives matter protest is racist ergo is a black lives matter protest racist
socialism,removed,oh please you werent doing shit before and you arent now theres going to be no bloodbath and literally nobody outside of this subreddit gives a damn about any of this no one is scared they are just ignoring this dumb make racists afraid shit
socialism,removed,am i supposed to be afraid of communists a bunch of edgy losers that have never lived in a communist country but think its great lol no one is afraid of you guys we have guns too
socialism,removed,they arent they talk tough on reddit but literally none of them have ever stomped a fascist lol
socialism,removed,why does every leftist movement focus on identity politics now get back to class and worker related issues
socialism,removed,leftist gun ownership is never gonna happen dont kid yourself

socialism,removed,you guys are fucking delusional you say that those on the right are fascists when a great many of them are trying to strip power away from government and return it to individuals you try to equate the right to nazis when hitler was a fucking socialist you know how i know that he was a socialist other than because nazi stood for national socialist german workers union because he ran on a platform of redistribution of wealth gun control and racial division just like you guys dooh and because he fucking said so im just an accidental visitor to your sub due to the traction that this post got and normally i wouldnt gate crash but the complete lack of intellectual integrity here made me feel the need to point out that you guys are a bunch of idiots who build your political ideology around easily disprovable lies that could only convince the most gullible andor uneducated members of society on behalf of all truthful thoughtful and productive members of society i would like to say fuck every last one you
socialism,removed,the nazis were the only ones holding american flags

socialism,removed,lol why would we do that when lefty politicians do it for us
socialism,removed,you realize other races are racist too
socialism,removed,you should probably read some progun forums most gunrights advocates applaud this type of stuff and wish it happened more
socialism,removed,i support gun rights but im still going to criticise when i see armed fascists or communists parading around in the street
socialism,removed,the problem is that many socialistsother leftists label anyone that opposes their views as fascist
socialism,removed,fash
socialism,removed,that map isnt a factual map
socialism,removed,whites can be victims of police brutality as well though
socialism,removed,maybe it fascinates you because you dont understand why they behaved like they did shit like appeasement and their behavior existed because they wanted to avoid another great war which obviously ended up as a failure stuff like anschluss and the abyssinian crisis were never about being a bulwark against socialism and communism they let these fascist regimes do whatever they wanted until they saw how much of a failure the policy of appeasement was
socialism,removed,i didnt see your lame response before i edited my post i edited it because the wording was bad
socialism,removed,but i thought the ussr wasnt communist
socialism,removed,once leftist gun ownership and carrying becomes more common the right is going to drop their talk about gun rights and start pushing for stronger gun control like they did when the black panthers were around this is the highest rated comment on this entire thread you are all protesting the status quo gun rights by violating gun laws to show how absurd laws acting like fucking criminals to showcase how loose gun laws isnt exactly convincing considering you cant even protest within the confines of the law
socialism,removed,ill go get my katana
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,no we wont you talking out your ass it wasnt the right that pushed back against the panthers
socialism,removed,im gonna laugh my ass off when one of these pussies threatens someone who actually knows how to shoot a gun when they die because of their own stupidity it should be a lesson to the rest of you violent commies

socialism,removed,castro was the embodiment of how a socialist revolution can be corrupted and fail to deliver any of the things it promised castro was a bigot and enjoyed luxury that his countrymen could only dream of he tore families apart destroyed livelihoods robbed the people and imprisoned and killed countless innocent people at least stalin lived in a shitty apartment and only owned a coat some painting stuff and a small piano dont recall him personally raping hundreds of women either castro lived a comfortable life with the things that he stole from others in the name of revolution any who idolize this wicked man reveal they are not socialists just anticapitalists

socialism,removed,why are we glorifying the life of such a terrible man he was more than a flawed revolutionary he stole raped imprisoned and murdered he betrayed the revolution he fought for even worse than stalin
socialism,removed,youre fucking crazy
socialism,removed,flawed i guess thats what we call someone who puts people to death for being ideologically opposed to you and your order its no wonder that so many americans are so violently opposed to socialism when its adherents would call a wanton murderer flawed

socialism,removed,cuban here improvements were made but at what cost yes the social programs and literacy was great but everything else about the situation pretty much sucks its like saying north koreas government is great the people are ignorant to their own quality of life because they know no better cuba would have gone socialist no matter what there was already a huge socialist push the one thing that went wrong is that the person at the forefront of the revolution got involved for selfish reasons and just wanted to rule a country for the rest of his life damn i wish my grandparents were alive to see this day hopefully something will change but i doubt it until raul steps down or dies that family needs to stop ruling the country and a democracy or true republic does need to take place

socialism,removed,good riddance
socialism,removed,is this one of those ironic subreddits or an actual one is there anybody posting here who is over the age of
socialism,removed,yes it is this sub claims to represent the socialist movement and its been hijacked by sjws this is not the place for that shit we are a movement that struggles to be taken seriously in much of the world and many who support socialism dont give a fuck about pc language i firmly believe that offensive language intended or not is simply a symptom of an ailing society lets treat the actual illness first and civilized language and behavior will follow authoritarian shaming and banning of certain language that is completely harmless to the vast majority of people is simply putting a bag on our own heads

socialism,removed,looking at this httpwwwstatisticbraincomnumberofamericanadultswhocantread it seems that a huge chunk of the people labeled illiterate are hispanic and includes immigrants who cant read english making it kind of a stupid metric as a decent number can probably read spanish fine the second highest group are africanamericans who already get the shit end of the us education and criminal justice system

socialism,removed,sorry never seen this sub is this a troll like the donald or do you guys actually believe in this if so can someone kindly explain to me your values and why you truly believe socialism is superior to free market i have a feeling that just like self esteem the meaning of words is skewed between people which is an unfortunate anomaly of our times its very convenient to skew definitions of words and concepts when advertising for a cause but not very helpful when it comes to uniting humans
socialism,removed,couldnt stump the trump though
socialism,removed,its startling how people are willing to become drones live off welfare become complacent and use socio economic factors as a crutch to explain away why they are oppressed it is also terrifying to think that poor people are owed something from the rich to see what i mean reverse the roles what if the rich demanded welfare from the poor
socialism,removed,may the old bastard rot in hell
socialism,removed,so if trump got rid of freedom of speech freedom of press and other civil rights but provided healthcare for all equivalent to what they have in cuba would he be a great leader oh yeah and he declares himself el presidente for life
socialism,removed,and the world is a much better place with both of those cocksuckers dead

socialism,removed,a beacon worth crossing the ocean on a rubber tire for
socialism,removed,in real life yes but the people here imagine its a complete utopia because they dont account for human nature of wanting to be on top
socialism,removed,there is no excuse for mourning the death of fidel castro castro in his infinite wisdom conducted over political executions via firing squad a tugboat named de marzo while carrying cuban refugees to the usa was attacked by one of castros boats and sank into the atlantic reluctant revolutionaries homosexuals jahovahs witnesses and other groups were rounded up and sent to umaps cuban renditions of soviet gulags cuba lived in terror for decades the world gained value when castro died cuba is one in a long list of examples of communism leading to widespread poverty and death
socialism,removed,is this a real comment or a joke
socialism,removed,and there family members were taken without notice and locked up in prison enjoy praising a tyrant

socialism,removed,get fucked scumbags may you all meet him sooner than later
socialism,removed,i am ubmrgould my timezone is utc i am on reddit everyday multiple times throught the day i am currently one of the active mods on ranarchism and even though it happens less for us i understand the tediousness of having posts hit the all our rules seem to be generally the same i would have to watch for small differences in the moderation before acting on some things but i would be happy to help clear reactionarys on here as well id like to see leftist subs continue to grow and helping with moderation here is a way for myself to be useful
socialism,removed,rest in agony to this murderous scumbag youre all pathetic for supporting a brutal dictator that murdered thousands interned gays and eliminated political adversaries

socialism,removed,thank god hes gone what an absolute dictator he was
socialism,removed,burn in hell commie bastard
socialism,removed,i dont even know if this happens i am not from america the reason why we hate leftist in our country is because nazis are a nonexisting problem leftist hurt more people every year than they do and they still go on the street to protest against nazis and destroy shit it just gets anyoing so are there any white supremecists that go around and yell thing like nigger and that put the head of blacks into a rope to hang them i doubt that this happend in any of the citys they did this what you now do is to get more and more mad you call each other names every side things they are right and now you even start to get with guns into the public for attention this is how it happend in my country and people didnt love the leftist they hated them they actually hated both sides but the nazis are not even really a threat to anybody in our country while leftist go around destroying shit every weekend thats the reason why trump won because people are anoyed by all this bullshit if an white sumpremicists goes into public to threatening minorities you call the police and you do the same with leftist that do this kind of shit you dont act like an edgy teen but ok why i am talking about this most of them are edgy teens
socialism,removed,from the mouth of the same man who locked up hiv victims in prisons then directed his parties newspapers to slander them as drug addicts and homosexuals to silence cuban citizens dissent the same monster who not only killed and locked up his political enemies but used his secret police to harass their family members i do not believe in hell but if i am wrong then may fidel burn in its fires for all time along with his supporters
socialism,removed,i fail to see the good in castros life
socialism,removed,finally this maniacal dictator is dead fuck socialism and fuck oppression
socialism,removed,good maybe michigan roads will get fixed also castro is dead good riddance
socialism,removed,terrorist and a murderer hes not wrong why does that hurt your feelings the fact that people here can just gloss over all things like him purging gays and executing people that disagreed with him by firing squads if appalling

socialism,removed,but shes still a dirt poor farmer
socialism,removed,castro was a terrorist and a murderer
socialism,removed,we have more rifles and our eyes arent cloudy with liberal faggot tears

socialism,removed,dumbass there will always be jobs they will just be more fulfilling like entertainment and the like youre just a lazy asshole who doesnt want to work
socialism,removed,castro was a demagogue who murdered those who dissented with him his legacy will be a bloodstain on history not a victorious revolutionary your placing this homicidal mad man on a pedestal and trying to whitewash the blood off his hands disgusts me after all no one man played so much a part in nearly causing global nuclear annihilation america is already becoming great again
socialism,removed,rot in hell you dictatorship garbage human being throw his corpse in gitmo and let the rats eat it
socialism,removed,be glad hes dead embrace capitalism socialism has failed every country its been in
socialism,removed,burn in hell fidel
socialism,removed,its funny how people frame anyone who opposed castro as a wealthy right winger when even some of his own supporters left after he became so extreme but hey anyone who has an antiamerican worldview gets their war crimes and atrocities covered up for the edgy marxists right
socialism,removed,try going to cuba and kneel during their national anthem and see what happens
socialism,removed,look two dead people that hated america socialism will never work but keep giving us something to laugh about
socialism,removed,rip fidel that is rest in pieces you communist piece of shit hope you burn in hell right next to che

socialism,removed,how does it feel to be typing that on a product that was made by the free market in a country that uses the free market that elected a billionaire businessman for president
socialism,removed,not so awesome when you consider he deprived so many of their basic human rights
socialism,removed,poor lgbt rights record at best careful anything but rote support for this murderer will get you banned here
socialism,removed,well i mean he put gays in concentration camps but its okay because hes socialist amirite
socialism,removed,rich trust fund kid is deeply saddened by a communist killer dying peacefully in his bed
socialism,removed,except for gays right castro
socialism,removed,the few good things that he has done get overblown and the atrocities hes committed get downplayed youll never find cubans on this sub because they hate their lives under socialistic rule but you can find examples all over reddit today of cubans and cuban americans explaining why people can get fooled into thinking he wasnt a monster
socialism,removed,thank you finally someone who isnt absolutely fucked in the head here he wasnt some sort of socialist saint he wasnt a good person by any means he killed many jailed his opposers and was responsible for a lot of the red scare im glad that piece of shit is dead
socialism,removed,no it fucking wont fuck him im glad hes dead
socialism,removed,anyone here read animal farm
socialism,removed,history will absolve him of purging gays i dont think so one can certainly argue the socialism capitalism individualism collectivism debates but castro created forced labor camps in the killed alot of homosexuals and his buddy che guevara burned books stifling the liberal pillar of free speech nbsp youre praising a tyrant stunts like this are why moderates dont take hardline socialists seriously whats next praising mao kill million people zedong
socialism,removed,rights of humanity httpbabalublogcomfidelcastrosgreatestatrocitiesandcrimes
socialism,removed,you know if you go around removing peoples posts for calling something dumb or crazy youre just going to end up alienating people sometimes i suspect your ilk of working for cointelpro trying to make sure socialism never catches on again
socialism,removed,good
socialism,removed,obviously he was a great guy and these people should all be in prison for opposing him fucking capitalist scum
socialism,removed,if you live in america then you should move to venezuela or cuba
socialism,removed,move to cuba then
socialism,removed,computers weve got mit bitches

socialism,removed,i love dictators who killed gay people
socialism,removed,well apparently he wasnt as good of a guy as ive seen some people saying and if you disagree look again at the people celebrating
socialism,removed,then leave
socialism,removed,deaths attributed to fidel castro more than executed with or without trial more than dead in prison more than disappeared
socialism,removed,deaths attributed to fidel castro more than executed with or without trial more than dead in prison more than disappeared thats why
socialism,removed,rip cruel dictator who cubans feared and took any chance to leave the country
socialism,removed,what a coincidence that in the cubans are sad that castro is dead and in a country with freedom of speech the cubans are celebrating who could have expected that
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,how could anyone doubt the sincerity of the tears of the cubans in cuba what possible reason would they have to fake it
socialism,removed,just dont mention the rights of his political opponents or rights like free speech or freedom to assemble or to openly practice religion
socialism,removed,they forgot the second part of the quote unless theyre gay just throw those people in concentration camps
socialism,removed,mass murder and economic ruination history is usually not a fan of that
socialism,removed,statism whether pretending to be socialist communist or capitalist is the mind virus responsible for these horrors when the state presumes itself a better judge of whats best for individuals than individuals themselves are capable of being the result is horror abuse and death
socialism,removed,if cuba and fidel were so great then why do cubans risk their lives floating here on rafts or all the cubanamericans celebrating that hes dead i guess only white kids from america can appreciate communism the people who live there always try to leavebefore a mod bans me why not have a actual discussion
socialism,removed,why should gay people be allowed to live free and not be in forced labor camps
socialism,removed,let us also celebrate the suppression if any free speech and press as well as the entire population living in abject poverty and not being able to have meat for the month because the rations ran out just talk go any of the cuban exiled who are celebrating in the streets of miami
socialism,removed,or we can kill those who are sick stupid and poor to make the statistics we have look great
socialism,removed,hes now in heaven killing homosexuals with stalin
socialism,removed,burn in hell castro
socialism,removed,history will absolve him of what the imprisonment of homosexuals the firing squads the famine theft and brutal interrogations of his secret police give me a fucking break the man was a tyrant who deserved to die decades ago fuck fidel castro
socialism,removed,are you all fucking retarded here castro killed and imprisoned homosexuals and political dissents everyone who opposed him got his property seized and their families killed by firing squads you all love jerking off to socialism while living in rich suburban neighbourhoods and drinking starbucks lattes i hope you get to live in your ideal society some day
socialism,removed,are you seriously going to keep pushing this religious behavior regarding word usage which not even the sub has a consensus on do you really believe a statement like we celebrate our stupidity literally upholds the subjugation of disabled people do you not understand what a homograph is and that the user isnt referring to disabled people this is why so many people outside the left have issues taking us seriously
socialism,removed,lol
socialism,removed,cuba reports yea they can report
socialism,removed,i am a retarded piece of shit so i believe that castro was a great guy and did not oppress the people of cuba che guevara totally did not believe in murdering the blacks and lgbt and loved everyone equally socialism is superior to capitalism even though capitalism has saved the environment more than socialism has through innovating various products that are less harmful to the environment due to consumer demand i am a retarded piece of shit and that is why i am a socialist
socialism,removed,yes its moronic
socialism,removed,ban me or whatever but yall are straight fuckin retarded
socialism,removed,satire
socialism,removed,hello im unihilistsfordespots and id like to apply as mod im in the pacific time zone and i have never posted here before for reasons i imagine the mods know but anyway uh i love the cwi
socialism,removed,hey famrades so im fairly new to this subredditand reddit in general i mostly frequented libcom and revleft but ive been a socialist for around years now as im sure many of the users around here can tell ive been extremely active as of late and try my best to offer criticism and foster discussion which can lead to a synthesis of interesting view points and ideas as far as ideologies are concerned im one of the rare ultra leftists around these partsso it seems i mostly identify with the communizer milieu but i heavily sympathize with trains of thought from various new left authors like theodor adorno and herbert marcuse and am a pretty big fan of international left communists like amadeo bordiga and antonie pannekoekdespite their differences my timezone is eastern standard time and my activity in this sub most likely will be fairly high especially as my universitys semester is coming to a close in the coming weeks im not one of the more agreeable users around these parts and im sure ive got in some sort of debate with most users in this subreddit at least once or twice but i feel as though someone who values in depth polemics and a critical analysis of the more traditional leftwing train of thought could shake the mod team up in possibly an interesting way anyway thanks for reading my application and i hope to see and participate in more interesting discussion on this forum in the very near future take care
socialism,removed,being a bit pedantic arent we
socialism,removed,welp time to increase socialism around the country guys i hope those moronic liberals learned their fucking lesson

socialism,removed,shrug i dont see how its not a legitimate question im sorry you chose to be snarky rather than welcoming because the latter could have produced a meaningful dialogue that may or may not have been fruitful instead im debasing myself with a plea that you treat me with the base amount of respect that every proven human being deserves im willing to do this because it may lead to a future where you or others accept that love and hope rather than snark and cynicism is the most effective way to talk about any ideal you hold dear
socialism,removed,so you want to commit treason in the name of communism so your a fascist

socialism,removed,fucking pinkoheads youre done
socialism,removed,and this is why regardless of who is president uniting the nation and putting it back on a good path is damn near impossible its one thing to disagree with a candidate and their policies but to actively work against a sitting president governor or mayor for no reason other than they dont fit your viewpoints is downright criminal
socialism,removed,just curious why dont you move to a socialist country if you are so fed up with america
socialism,removed,im curious as to why at least why now to quote john wayne when kennedy won i didnt vote for him but hes my president and i hope he does a good job personally i think trump as potus is appalling especially as the father of a young child who has to see this man as the leader of the free world and then be told how wrong it is to be a bully christ im one of those people that gets pissed off when potus isnt referred to as president suchandsuch doesnt matter which party or policies thats the president respect the position not necessarily the person or gtfo if trump does something as potus that warrant organizing like this then ill be one of the first to sign up but this sounds like bitching because youre butthurt organize for a purpose not feelingsimho

socialism,removed,and nothing else would change that would make him a job creator someone has to make the casket someone has to clean the street someone has to wipe the goo off of the bulldozer
socialism,removed,this is the reason people dont support socialism you sound just like chavez and maduro preaching progressive idealogies in order to swindle the venezuelan people into buying their bullshit but ultimately leading the country into full on socialism and watching it burn
socialism,removed,and the racist misogynist strongman i have a hard time listening to anyone so blatantly biased i voted for hillary but you still sound like a nutjob with this stuff his racist misogyny seems as based on reality as her funding isis ive heard the arguments i dont buy it as racism or misogyny like provoking tensions to the point of war i voted for hillary for a number of reasons but i and many other people believe she would be more likely to lead us to war putin today said hes on board with restoring relations with the us now that trump is president
socialism,removed,i understand that this accusation has been leveled against him yes i understand that some people have bought into it i know some people have bought into it so much that they refuse to see any other point of view for sure
socialism,removed,if anyone is in southern indiana hmu
socialism,removed,people are too sensitive white sjws are more upset with trump winning than minorities are
socialism,removed,it just seems to me that he hasnt broken any rules or laws yet there are moral rules that many feel he has broken but until the majority of americans agree with the minority as to the deplorable nature of these actions then theres not much that can be done besides educating the public i just dont think its right to grab our pitchforks just yet lest we become that which we fight against also the foreigners are coming to attack and if you dont hate them youre not a patriot not sure where youre from regionally but this has been very real since for most of rural america trump fanned the flames but he certainly didnt create it but i guess agree to disagree
socialism,removed,south florida here im really looking to start organizing for most of my life my crippling social anxiety has prevented me from doing work on the ground but this election has spurred me to conquer that fear

socialism,removed,republican controlled house republican controlled senate trump nominating a possible justices making republicans also control the supreme court if ive ever seen an exercise in futility before this is it we can sit back let the shtf and if things get fucky enough maybe those mouth breathers will come around my buddy was out last night said the bar cheered when djt won florida and someone shouted were not gonna be pc anymore fuck faggots so yeah even when trump colossally fucks everything up even when putins sipping tea in the rose garden even after all that were still gonna have a massive problem on our hand legitimacy can be down right scary think of the types of thought this fucker has legitimized
socialism,removed,at long last some glimpse of sense amidst all of tonights butthurt yes porky bought your sorry excuse of a party made an entire campaign built on shaming the supporters of the other guys with celebrities mass media and everything else they could throw at them likewise the correct the record clowns strategy never had any objective more ambitious than provoking certain emotional responses on the social media front and the result of all that hard work is before the whole world to see makeem angrier will ya what could possibly go wrong but of course the unwashed brainwashed who are still literally literaling will not blame the party who pulls the strings and the most hated clone of thatcher they could possibly find this is all bernìethird partiespartiarchycopsassangerussias fault the gospel of your immaculate goddess descended from the donkey olympus can only be infallible it has everything to do with people in the countryside hating muslim mexican nongenderbinary pansexual immigrants of color and nothing to do with the material conditions of those who live away from the city and a certain candidate or two pandering to those welcome to year its the economy stupid james carville campaign strategist of bill clinton i await the inevitable ban

socialism,removed,cry salty tears little cucks
socialism,removed,response to a comment this is hilariously pathetic go live in russia if you cant handle democracy dont people have the right to protest against governments they disagree with this sub has a particularly strong hate for trump in particular along with a similar hatred of hillary as hes just as representative of the bourgeois and ruling class as his rival also hillary did win the popular vote and only lost due to the ec what kind of democracy is that if hillary had won there wouldve been just as many demonstrations against her this unfortunately is the manifestation of the deplorable democracy that the us boasts a system where both parties are incredibly similar using identity politics to polarize the electorate and generate hatred for eachother in order to allow both parties to sidestep real issues and focus on shitthrowing in the us third parties are given unfair restrictions on funding on media access and are just outspent and outspoken at every opportunity the state reminds you constantly that third parties are a waste of time that youre throwing your vote away the establishment only wants you to think you live in a real democracy but they never want you to act on it american culture regarding politics propagates this lie that you have to pick the lesser of two evils rather than who you want and that in itself serves to provide real power to those who exploit it democracy is a system where the government is run by the people some of these people have chosen to exercise their right to protest whether it be against a system that lead dt to win despite technically losing or whether it be to capitalise on the emotions of the election to remind people that they dont have to submit to the establishment system if trump won because of a movement that sought to overthrow the establishment that they saw in hillary they should also seek to overthrow that same establishment embodied by anyone in their government trump has a unique opportunity to transform politics in the us but he alone wont change it all it must be a decisive action from the masses that have spent too long under a system that hasnt spoken for real people in too long
socialism,removed,well he should become a legal citizen then oh no im sorry thats racist
socialism,removed,probably because working class rights isnt what the working class wants anymore they got the rights and the jobs left now they want the jobs back which is why they all voted right wing populism

socialism,removed,sexist language is language that excludes either men or women when discussing a topic that is applicable to both sexes this includes using the word man to refer to humanity and using titles like congressman and fireman another common error that shows gender bias is assuming that the subject of all sentences is male i stand by my reasoning that neither of those words are sexist by definition of what sexist words are i shall await my ban but the media are still twats

socialism,removed,an immensely evil dictator you people should be ashamed of yourselves
socialism,removed,the hells wrong with you people castro most certainly didnt fight for freedom in fact it was completely the opposite
socialism,removed,i feel for the loss to the cuban people who will send the gays to labor camps murder the dissidents and keep the people in abject poverty through force and violence now

socialism,removed,you pampered morons have no idea what its like to live under a communist regime and having all your property taken away by your governement one of my relatives was in prison for almost a decade simply for protesting the government fidel castro was murderer and a thief shame on you guys for idolizing him
socialism,removed,i dont get it i thought real socialism has never been tried why are you praising castro if he didnt implement real socialism or was cuba a example of real socialism

socialism,removed,crazy how much of a gap there is
socialism,removed,not nice
socialism,removed,dont forget literally any cuban who lived under him will tell you it was a horrible place
socialism,removed,oh wow slatecom i doubt this is even remotely true
socialism,removed,you say dang youre right because castro was a tyrannical dictator who killed and imprisoned people he didnt like why are so many american socialists so eager to put despots on a pedestal when there are legitimate democratic socialist nations that dont pollute the reputation of socialism
socialism,removed,its probably one of the leading reasons all of the politically correct identity politics the left plays are the reason we have a fascist president elect in the us now
socialism,removed,the phrase celebrate our stupidity is not offensive to anyone it does not denigrate anyone op is stating a fact that collectively american society is full of ignorant people this is not a slur against them some people literally are ignorant to the ways of the world and ignorant to different viewpoints lose your thin skin the real world is a very tough place to be and nobody has time to deal with your nonsense
socialism,removed,is that an iphone box how can you call yourself a socialistcommunistwhatever
socialism,removed,a lot of those people arent implicitly racist they are tired of the identity politics we shouldnt be fighting tooth and nail for women or trans people or poc we should be fighting for every human being for human rights and dignity for all by continuing down the path of identity politics you alienate a vast majority of the population go tell some poor white minimum wage worker that theyre privileged and see how far you can make that conversation go identity politics is out pragmatism is in
socialism,removed,rsocialismisterrible
socialism,removed,excuse my ignorance but i always thought that venezuela was one correct me if im wrong i would like a genuine conversation
socialism,removed,you wrote that entire rant and ended it with a pity party for yourself i hate to break it to you but identity politics is dead if you think that being trans gay black brown white or anything makes you more important or less important than another human being youre wrong im allowed to be equally concerned about black people being targeted by institutionalized racism as i am middle class white people being targeted by economic terrorism committed by republicans in your mind youve created this dichotomy where anyone who doesnt speak with you is against you that isnt how the real world works
socialism,removed,lets have someone who thinks a homosexual murdering bigots death should be celebrated as if he was the second coming of jesus that seems to be a major criteria for this place the bigot club
socialism,removed,the pc police have coopted socialism and anarchism in the last several years when i first became interested in the philosophy over a decade ago it was primarily about increasing the rights of the workers and fighting for human rights and dignity for all peoples now its a shit show of everyone pointing out their individuality and how that makes their viewpoint unique and special
socialism,removed,my issue is that chavez did give the power to the workers he promoted the setting up of independent organisations of the working class initially in the form of the bolivarian circles and through the consejos communales or communalneighbourhood councils those organisations have been compared in their form and function to the soviets in russia in in that they represent potentially at least a form of dual power the groups of workers from around venezuela who are occupying and running industries on a collective basis after their capitalist owners either closed them down or fled abroad it was fresco which pushed the nationalization of the industry freteco has been in the spotlight in its demands for the nationalisation of sanitarios maracay a ceramics manufacturer under workers control in aragua province however the workers from that factory marched on caracas to present their demands and push them out suffice to say i always thought it was the shining triumph of chavez and the socialist revolution
socialism,removed,he is seizing the means of production with stalin now
socialism,removed,lol i love this its so completely ridiculous youre the reason that the republicans won the house senate and the presidency so for that i thank you
socialism,removed,full of liberal scum doesnt seem very civilized
socialism,removed,social democracy sure can accomplish a lot cant it too bad its still just capitalism no matter how involved the state is
socialism,removed,if cuba is so wonderful how come there are so many cubans in my state that had to risk their lives to get away unemployment rate of but the entire country is poor and has limited access to basic goods and services tbh the only things on the list that i found even remotely impressive were the ones about gender equality but women in parliament is a pretty moot point when the government is basically a mislabeled dictatorship please dont bother bringing up the embargo only the us participated and the general population hasnt seemed to benefit from trade with other nations communism sounds beautiful in theory but human nature always wins and human nature is greedy
socialism,removed,lol this is pretty weird dude
socialism,removed,firing squads detainment and prison for no reason for no reason ridiculous restrictions on personal freedoms including access to media and interneteven gathering in groups without a permit i lost some serious respect for her is kim jung un on the list i mean he really sticks it to the man
socialism,removed,most americans are too stupid to realize unions would help them they have literally bought into the idea that unions are evil the white working class literally is destroying itself for the benefit of the megarich
socialism,removed,saying stupid isnt ableist
socialism,removed,no but calling someone stupid is wildly different
socialism,removed,disgusting red fags you should all be lined up and shot down

socialism,removed,not for your queer and anarchists comrades who you shot and put into camps authoritarian punks fuck off
socialism,removed,do you know anything about marx he was a disgusting person who never bathed or bothered to look nice was always in debt lived off his parents money and never paid his housekeeper so basically owned the only slave im europe yea real great guy
socialism,removed,voluntary transactions between individuals where is race mentioned here
socialism,removed,do you know what kind of a person marx was
socialism,removed,karl marx was an anti semite can you have communism without racism no oh right because times were different back then i dont care what went on back then it was primitive and disgusting ok capitalism is private ownership of the means of production how else can you have free trade
socialism,removed,sorry my fault he was living of engels a friend and factory owner and his wifes money what a fucking hypocrite huh lives off the charity of a factory owner who makes his money off the labor of others yet hates the capitalist hes worse than a capitalist at least engels ran the business provided value marx was a filthy leech fun fact is cash flow never dropped below that of that of an average wage worker of the time much of his concept for communism came from his abysmal money management skills he was constantly borrowing money and was furious when he got his bills for the money he borrowed because they had interest due on them boo hoo money has time value you child dont want interest due learn to save i also read his communist manifesto a few months back actually it honestly just sounded like a whiny dude who hated rich people because they were rich he was a terribly neglectful father who lived with his family in disgusting filth and regularly denied his daughters the rights to education and careers and again lived in filth when he could have easily done better for his poor daughters also he fucked his housekeeper for a third kid and lied about it he also had a housekeeper who he didnt pay a literal slave i think i mentioned that somewhere else though so much for a legendary philosopher huh i strongly recommend you look beyond his own writings to learn more about how vile of a person he really was
socialism,removed,appreciating music is a little different than following his work to formulate your worldview can you give an example of communism improving the life of anyone i have a proposal maybe karl should have spent more time not making his kids miserable by abusing and neglecting them before trying to seize the means of production
socialism,removed,never truly says why shes getting evicted no backstory other than shes oppressed gib money
socialism,removed,and we should help because shes trans
socialism,removed,property rights is not capitalism
socialism,removed,anthropologist here biological race do exist we see it in dogs quite explicitely and in humans it would be called genetic population for example i could say that all m for the past several decades olympic gold medalist are jamaican and one might answer that no they are from jamaica canada usa and uk but actually all descendant of the mixity of jamaica who has a stronger explosive protein which allows them to run faster but not as much for longer distances xenophobic is the term that should be used in regards to islamophobia unless were talking about those ridiculous white trash whod think that by seeing the skin of a dude he can claim to know his religious background then yes that may be called racism which is a generalisation of a cultural trait on a biological one which doesnt mean genetical traits dont exist it just mean that some ignorance generalises wrongly
socialism,removed,fuck socialism
socialism,removed,commies pls gi
socialism,removed,and remember if a woman cooks and cleans afterwards shes just doing her womanly duty if a man does it he deserves a blowjob referencing that dumbass poster that went viral or even better a professional chef which is a maledominated profession in itself but women should never get repaid in any way for culinary labor 👀
socialism,removed,so youre saying my so needs to pay me directly for the cooking cleaning and direct care of our child in addition to housing me and putting food on our table
socialism,removed,this has zero to due with socialism
socialism,removed,humans are highly sexually dimorphic and likely evolved with the different sexes performing mostly different tasks i think its only natural and it can be more efficient if thats what you want to do as a couple
socialism,removed,my guess would be the hundreds of millions of people oppressed displaced or killed by various communist regimes im sure it will work out next time though
socialism,removed,my wife cleans and i hate to be addressed immediately
socialism,removed,but socialism isnt communism
socialism,removed,the revolutionaries on reddit are huge advocates for economic reductionism of kyriarchal struggles once they supported brexit it made me realize how little die hard revolutionaries actually consider intersectional analysis and their unwillingness to change their ideas because it would mean they would have to abandon their traditions it made me realize that if qwoc are not the center of analysis then we repeat their oppression under a different form it has happened in the soviet union and in maoist china the sad part is almost none of them will take responsibility for it they just downvote and moveon
socialism,removed,why do we let fucking multinationals mine here they give very little and always end fucking up everything
socialism,removed,no no no no there are a lot of idiots in this thread communism is equal distribution of work and all resources for everyone and only works in small communities socialism takes control of the sectors of society that concern public welfare these include publicizing and making available for everyone education healthcare banking and the justice system prisons among others it also seeks to give livable wages and good working conditions for the publicalong with social programs for those who need them another big difference is that under communism every one is garunteed a job with equal pay regardless of how hard they work doctors and mcdonalds employees would make the same wages socialism respects individuals right to property and to fair paying labor socialism is a structured people first policy that can be put into effect within our capitalist system communism thinks that people deserve equal resources when really people deserve equal opportunity
socialism,removed,lenin consciously chose to put down councils cripple the soviets you can handwave those choices away but they had consequences the worst of these is the swapping out of one ruling class for another lenin had no interest in democracy youre a major asshole seriously youre an asshole but i guess thats consistent with vanguardism if you believe you have the answers in spite of the people everybody else is just an idiot standing in your way so go fuck yourself
socialism,removed,the best thing for black people would be to teach them about the importance of family highlight the number of children born out of wedlock in black america and the challenges single black mothers face raising children particularly sons raising successful children isnt difficult give them a strong family and a solid education and half the battle is won this is why asians succeed where blacks dont they dont need more lessons in victimhood
socialism,removed,muh oppreshun
socialism,removed,tell that to the miners the mothers the construction workers the nurses the farmers etc etc because working class people are idiots right it is reassuring to know that the people apparently fighting for me consider me to stupid to understand basic english
socialism,removed,are you pretending the bolsheviks didnt work to subsume the soviets in the congress and that they didnt actively work to make the actual workers marginal you can pretend these things didnt happen and call me stupid for not accepting the same pretense that wont change the fact these things happened
socialism,removed,wouldnt it be better that he teach them to make better life choices than to battle an imaginary enemy
socialism,removed,so hes indoctrinating children to turn them into violent radicals
socialism,removed,lol guess this is what you do when you fail horribly at professional football how to sink your career in one game starring colin kaepernick
socialism,removed,that is a pretty stupid and idiotic thing to do isnt it
socialism,removed,when is racial solidarity acceptable in a socialist worldview
socialism,removed,while i agree that fukuyama is a fool please dont use ableist language
socialism,removed,fuck what that guy said below i have a very serious learning disability and thoroughly approve of such application of the word
socialism,removed,everyones comparing him to hitler and yet no ones calling for his assassination odd isnt it almost like you dont really think hes hitler after all
socialism,removed,why would anyone try to produce anything if the government can come in a seize it
socialism,removed,díaz pinochet chavez and castro are all bad
socialism,removed,why would anyone produce anything if the government can come in and take it whenever they feel like it
socialism,removed,i would leave a comment about how theyre just mad they cant hop the border anymore but then the secret police mods would get me
socialism,removed,well mexicos a dump so maybe focus on your country
socialism,removed,what the actual fuck is this subreddit the collective iq of these commenters seem to be in the teens somewhere
socialism,removed,because mexico can really talk about their great leadership right now lol
socialism,removed,they need to worry about their own president first
socialism,removed,nice work just disagreeing with me with absolutely no evidence or any type of argument otherwise fuck your politiical correctness people dont get special privileges because theyre dumbasses also the communism socialism misconception is what is stifling any actual discussion for a socialist system in america
socialism,removed,when you take literally hitler too seriously
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,so theyre a fan
socialism,removed,facism called out by socialism how ironic

socialism,removed,i hope she gets hit by a bus tory twat
socialism,removed,do you have evidence to back up your assertions
socialism,removed,fake and gay
socialism,removed,as a capitalist i tend to think this country canada has granted provincial and federal governments too much autonomy over our daily affairs we have an intricate mix of social programs and industry subsidiestariffs that do canadians more harm than good i mean look at our federal payroll taxes do you think i will ever get the ei that i contributed how about cpp why shouldnt i have the right to spend my money the way i want to its like in our quest to babysit people because we think the public knows how to spend private money better individuals do weve created a horribly bureaucratic and inefficient system i think its worse in canada than in the us when it comes to some of these social programs
socialism,removed,communism is not just not that bad it is the movement which will bring prosperity and liberty to those who do not have itthe working class as it has in the past im sure
socialism,removed,hmm comments wonder how many left coms are throwing hissy fits in them
socialism,removed,context is key wikipedia can be edited by anyone its extremely easy to change shot to assassinated still it happened almost half a century ago so well never know what truly happened
socialism,removed,it completely disproves your post though while cointelpro certainly shows the us government violating freedom of speech it also show that this is something they do to all sides left and right leftists certainly have been targeted but thats not a reason to trash free speech its a reason to support it twice as much and ensure that it is properly enforced
socialism,removed,the only examples i could find were david walsh taking the piss out of bourgeois criminal justice which isnt really the same as defending rape or molestation the first post in this thread is a decent response from my perspective it looks like petty intertrot drama but im admittedly prone to confirmation bias there p from the sticky on rsts it looks like this subreddit isnt clean either in any event i value legitposting more than shitposting so i guess my hands are tied rgd those other subs that said the claim that posting in those subs is promoting a toxic environment even for users who are not engaged in harassment is laughable in light of the full situation
socialism,removed,try rvenezuela they should have plenty of time to give you answers considering theyre standing in a line waiting for hopefully but not probably some food to eat
socialism,removed,goes up to poblacht hi im an anarchist gets called an anarkid cries posts about it on sts harassment gets banned from r soc

socialism,removed,apparently his boss came and smacked him in the head with a shovel and when he fell down someone got into a truck and ran over the poor bastard a union picket line wouldnt be stupid enough to have anyone walk really really slowly in front of a road entrance to a business because thats bullshit and unions would never stand for that crap because someone could get killed
socialism,removed,i was there protesting our boss walked up to us and yelled not only are you all fired but i fucking killayou all mama mia then he sprinted at us with a knife i luckily got away but poor lil ahmed here got pwnt

socialism,removed,¯ツ¯
socialism,removed,disgusting views here really suckerpunching often members of the working class who have been momentarily won over by a charismatic antiestablishment figure is fucked you guys gonna extrapolate this retribution across the million people whove voted for him being a trump supporter does not make you a hardcore fascist worthy of being twatted across the face when the national front or kkk turn up maybe you got a case then worst of all what does it achieve whacking a few trumpteers doesnt even register with the mass support his movement has you arent scaring anyone away from supporting him this whole thing just seems like a vanity project an excuse for individual violence
socialism,removed,draft dodger
socialism,removed,minimum wage minimum skill i just visited an out of state mcdonalds last week that had kiosks instead of cashiers due to a recent wage hike if you are working a job that requires little education and skill you should not get paid an hour thats absurd we need to focus on education and get more people discernible skills not raise the wages of low skill super market shelf stockers also the minimum wage is a minimum the lowest a person can legally be paid how does it make sense that someone should be able to live off of this
socialism,removed,i want to torture her in my basement and eat her skin when im done with her fucking liberals these days dont know how to fight fascism
socialism,removed,is that not an inherent flaw with socialism that eventually resources taken from everyone end up in the hands of the few rich that control the party
socialism,removed,i hope more than anything that the useful idiots would protest somewhere that has concealedopen carry laws instead they beat up women and children in gun free zones
socialism,removed,if you had of people screaming at you saying that youre an idiot for being a socialist and then take a bag of rocks to the side of your head would you change your mind about socialism just curious
socialism,removed,you mean all of those white folks rehearsed said muhammad alis coming all the whores get off the streets—all the whores all the whores muhammad alis coming everybody walk quietly and peacefully all hundred nationalities pretend you get along muhammad alis coming all the policemen take your guns off—i dont want more than two of you in the whole city muhammad alis coming yes they did do that they were soviets thats what they did they did atrocities that were at least as bad as the holocaust and then intimidated the civilians into telling people that none of it was real
socialism,removed,probably because they never had the chance to they were across the world from him they sure as well wouldve called him it if they met him they were exceptionally racist
socialism,removed,tldr communists who support mass immigration migrant crisis mexican invasion are useful idiot for global capitalists
socialism,removed,you know its a socialist when they cant spell our
socialism,removed,no its more like we see constant examples of the failure that is socialism especially from the younger people who run businesses and arent looking for a handout unlike many who realized their african gender studies degree isnt going to make them employable

socialism,removed,probably because they didnt speak english
socialism,removed,great rationale buddy im just gonna go around and attack people and call it self defense by your account that justifies my actions regardless
socialism,removed,people chanting trump as they beat the hell out of our brothers and sisters source and jesus fucking christ you people are either highschool retards or senile dipshits
socialism,removed,im all for people defending themselves when they need to defend themselves so far the only people who need defending are people being clubbed by rocks just for attending a rally
socialism,removed,its our you fucking retarded year old
socialism,removed,fuck all you faggot ass beta commies
socialism,removed,because trump supporters arent going out of their way to physically assaulting latinos
socialism,removed,seriously you are for rioting because you dont agree with a candidate for president
socialism,removed,perceived victimization
socialism,removed,actually socialism caused this crisis it wasnt the evil bourgeoisie or some mismanagement it was the entire system that setup venezuela to fail the same system you believe in just look at chile they dont have any natural resources but they are the most prosperous country in south america more importantly they are a country with a heavy focus on entrepreneurship and capitalism just admit it socialism doesnt work
socialism,removed,so your further left then bernie but your an anarchist im confused wouldnt being further left mean you want even more government control there is nothing anarchist about that at all
socialism,removed,what kind of fucked up version of defense involves beating up someone because they disagree with you if the very specter of someone supporting a political candidate that might possibly win an election and do harm while they themselves are not physically harming anyone represents a viable target for selfdefense ie politically motivated attack then by that logic someone from pakistan would be well within their rights to cut your head off if you ever paid any amount of tax that went towards funding drone attacks in pakistan you know actually directly financially contributing towards people being killed rather than just having different political ideas than you
socialism,removed,over correcting from the liberal leftist lunacy and identity politics i think feelssogoodman trump eat a fucking dick nigger

socialism,removed,the north vietnamese were fighting a defensive war against an invading army that wanted to overthrow their government for ideological wars that is the exact definition of legitimate self defense its the bullshit ideas that are dangerous are a threat and killing people who support those ideas is self defense that america used to justify invading another country attacking nonviolent political opponents is exactly the same tactics that fascists have used throughout history
socialism,removed,well communism sorry socialism keeps everyone just on the edge of poverty a socialist government would have a revolution anyways you know why part of the reason the ussr failed people want more shit and so do i hell without capitalism you wouldnt be on reddit right now
socialism,removed,pedophilia child sexual assault and or rape fuck that im for chemical castration and forced hard labour til death
socialism,removed,i didnt say that though did i i said youre advocating the same tactics which you are right unless youre saying its now not okay to be violent towards people who are violent just because they have a political ideology you deem to be a threat
socialism,removed,i dont think hillary is the most realistic or even the right candidate but nice try the amendment matters whether you like it or not political grievance is no excuse to attack an individual for hisher beliefs you might like to believe so from the bottom of your heart but that doesnt make it so assaulting others for their beliefs is counterproductive painting them as the victim and the attacker as the bully and rightfully so just look at the title of this thread bash the fash the cognitive dissonance is astounding you guys give trump a run for his money in that respect you can lie to yourself all you want but the object of violence is violence

socialism,removed,there is abstract theory and then there is the facts on the ground if you want to talk theory ill be ten times as radical as you can imagine you have no idea how far out there my ideology is im sure youd find my ideas quite insane i think family relations should be dismantled and replaced with a generalized system of polyamory is that radical enough for you i think the government should encourage people to take lsd and send it to them for free in the mail i think we should destroy the schools i think there is a simple stepbystep method to destroy the money system entirely and smash artificial scarcity my theories are radical as fuck dont give me this progressive liberal bullshit mao was a pedestrian compared to my positions im a postlsd communist i belong to the dance party you heard of it you want to talk about radical lets talk but i also understand that there is radical theory about how things might be someday and then there is the reality we are in today and the reality of how we get from here to there defense is for losers politics is a game not too different from basketball in that it is all about the art of the foul youve got to be inyourface but you dont do that by focusing on what the other side is doing you make them come to you its a lot easier to game the one who is trying to follow you than it is to game the one you are following because in the first case youre setting the pace and in the second they are im saying you have to blaze the trail not play follow the leader this progressive liberal labeling circle jerk that goes on in this sub makes it worthless to even bother posting here much of the time but i dont give a fuck where am i gonna spend all those freakin comment karma points anyway the point is worth making here and i dont mind if people dont want to hear it you cant lead by following who gives a fuck about what costumes the fascists are wearing this season ignore them and get on with doing something real shit is going down if you think legalizing cannabis doesnt matter and has nothing to do with socialism well youre wrong
socialism,removed,connect the fucking dots amigo artificial scarcity
socialism,removed,his body wasnt even cold and its already being used for political gain stay classy rsocialism
socialism,removed,this logic is now being applied to attack trumpsupporters but it could also be applied to attacking your mom shes a fascist because i say so so pelt her with eggs before she turns hitler
socialism,removed,no youre using his death for political gain right now as a disgusting lilywhite reprimand to stay respectful and not taint muhammad alis name with his own damn words interesting approach to strawman i just thought itd be a nice idea for the heat to leave the body before everyone begins spamming quotes from years ago
socialism,removed,i guess youve never been to a real funeral before where you remember peoples lives gasp funeral deathbed
socialism,removed,he already was nicknamed the greatest years before he made these comments in he was a celebrity its what helped bail his ass out in court he was overall famous for his gas dropping boxing skills his quick tongue and yes his politics also you claimed earlier that these comments were not controversial but they got him banned for years and stripped of his title yeah really blew over everyones head
socialism,removed,apart from all the republican debates he participated in and the debates with clinton hell be participating in the only way to stop him is to prevent him from speaking sorry i thought you people were supposed to be fighting fascism
socialism,removed,i guess starving million ukrainians isnt considered oppressive otherwise socialism would be included
socialism,removed,i dont think you know what the words controversial mean he was barred from boxing for years he was taken to court he lost he appealed the decision and it went to the supreme court they ruled in when public opinion had soured on the war and civil rights reached mainstream popularity youre whitewashing history
socialism,removed,it was pretty intolerant of stalin to starve million ukrainians and purge million in the military impressive considering he did all of this before the holocaust and topped the million jews that hitler slaughtered with a more conservative estimate on the holodomor in ukraine it could be up to million in reality but yes i agree we need to limit free speech
socialism,removed,sorry i prefer to get my news from sites other than the ones with the paintings of stalin and the other ones that literally say sputnik i stick to pravda and the new york times
socialism,removed,libertarian capitalist yes
socialism,removed,so you agree with censoring speech you disagree with and then backtrack and say im not sure where i stand you just said part of me thinks free speech needs to have limits pick one
socialism,removed,at this point voting is the most impactful action you can take in order to stop trump if thats what youre implying here protesting is necessarily but violent protest is just going to make more people move to trumps camp you can turn a blind eye to this fact yet reality wont change accordingly
socialism,removed,or voting duh
socialism,removed,instead of being anti be pro be prolegalization of marijuana be prosolar power be proactive in sharing media online be prolgbtq be prohomeless stand up for things you want to defend instead of playing the reaction game thats dumb im antifascist not pronotfascist being pro or anti is a matter of the question asked but the thing is there are lots of things that arent fascist ask the other republicans where nevertrump got them being opposed to something is insufficient you have to put forward a coherent competing vision that can garner support you really do have to be prosomething in order to win
socialism,removed,yeah no undermining the democratic process before the process has had a chance to fail is a deliberate refusal to listen to the will of the people reacting violently before there is a necessity will only make the calmer party trumps people look more reasonable you know what i think when i see a screaming mob no matter what they are saying i think that its just a matter of time before that mindless beast turns on me
socialism,removed,your lack of selfawareness is genuinely mindblowing are the fascists the ones turning up to the political rallies of their opponents and assaulting them or is that the so called antifascists seriously you condemn people for being unwilling to debate you havent proven this by the way youre just telling me theyre unwilling to debate then in the same paragraph justify shutting down peoples right to speak because you dont like what they have to say youre a goddamn lunatic and you sound like youre in a cult it warms my heart to know that your little socialist revolution is never going to happen
socialism,removed,at least we arent tumblr
socialism,removed,altrighters are indeed a reactionary movement when people see illegal immigrants and bernie supporters using violence and censorship against their political opponents as opposed to facts and reason they turn to a movement that is the opposite of that
socialism,removed,women dont like radical freaks such as socialists yourself
socialism,removed,socialism makes everyone equal by making everyone equally poor and lazy great right
socialism,removed,the best disinfectant is sunlight they say if you want to defeat fascism you must expose it for what it is censoring fascist ideas simply gives them more support if you really want to defeat fascism expose their dangerous ideas
socialism,removed,you guys keep mentioning fascism but all it means is a dictatorship that controls its peoples lives and suppresses opposition what does that have to do with donald trump if anything its the left who want more control over peoples lives and are the ones suppressing the opposition by branding opinions they disagree with as hate speech httpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryfascism
socialism,removed,socialism happened
socialism,removed,the rpolitics mods are seriously ignorant something all of reddit can agree on
socialism,removed,many millions of people would consider your rhetoric hate speech should your platform be removed
socialism,removed,theres no such thing as equality between the sexes what does that even mean
socialism,removed,socialism is not a new and refreshing ideology its been tried with catastrophic results
socialism,removed,no need for the s
socialism,removed,fuck you and everyone here you people are everything wrong with the world anti antifa needs to be a thing you guys are worse than the so called fascists you talk about
socialism,removed,and when i cant pay rent ive been raped and im unable to feed myself the last thing i want from a socialist forum is bros maybe spend less time with your socialist forum bros and youll better be able to pay rent and feed yourself
socialism,removed,lol nice parody
socialism,removed,but a protester throws a few eggs at a trumpette and suddenly all leftists are violent thugs dont be ignorant the egg assault was the least violent thing at the san jose rally people were literally being chased down and beaten people were being surrounded and sucker punched then stomped on people were hit in the head with a bag of rocks do not act like all they did was throw an egg
socialism,removed,thats what i thought you made a false comment and then get upset when someone calls you out about it looks like you need your safe space
socialism,removed,lol this is sad
socialism,removed,in socialist societies everyone becomes homeless together in solidarity
socialism,removed,in the uk it is illegal to be homeless all local governments have legal requirement to home everyone whether that is putting someone up in a hostel longterm or putting someone up in emergency temporary housing hotels homeless in the uk are almost all there through choice or are newly homeless and unaware of the options available to them in which cases they are not punished and are directed to the available systems this has nothing to do with capitalism and it seems like everyone has gone horribly off track because they dont know the british system
socialism,removed,i think theres something wrong with you i spent actual time homeless in the uk nothing i said is false if you want to actually contribute do so but dont just attack someone because you dislike the truth
socialism,removed,it astounds me that people on this website without experiences argue with those who have actual experiences theres nothing wrong with shifting people to where there are services available there are more pressing homelessness issues than the need to be close to whatever
socialism,removed,different councils have strikingly different budgets its not a single council issue its a countrywide issue it isnt palming them off its shifting them to where there are immediately available solutions due to better available budgets in that area it doesnt help them i never said it does help them theyre making a conscious personal choice to be on the street instead of homed though i know because ive seen it begging is a separate issue that im not really very well read on i dont know what legislation currently is nor how councils are handling food banks and systems surrounding the homeless now but again i suspect the reason is their choice to be on the street being a major problem obviously the solution to all of this is to somehow make these people stop choosing homelessness compared to being under a roof and going through the system but how do you get them to do that its the old problem of being able to lead a horse to water but not force it to drink
socialism,removed,the empire would be a communismsocialism because their both evil
socialism,removed,yes and yes you can opt out of the state by not working and not purchasing you would need to buy land and materials to become self sufficient and then following that there is no reason for you to participate in society neither contributing nor receiving you would need a nonpermanent structure to live in and no taxable income you could socialise but buying anything would contribute tax and if you used roads etc you would theoretically be taking from society therefore you wouldnt be opting out creating a society in an libertarian state would be far easier just get together with whoever wanted to take part create a governing body pool resources and ho from there becomes more complicated the larger it gets you could theoretically do that now by merging the first part of my post with the second but it would become pretty obvious pretty quick and i dont think the state would approve
socialism,removed,yeaaahhhhh youre a paranoid lunatic
socialism,removed,the stress and anguish it causes people especially the underlying fears tied to expectation in others as well as within ourselves we can go on and on about the manufactured materialism found in western culture today but i find the notion of expectation during the holidays the most interesting part will heshe the gift they want how will they actreact to said gift what am i saying or not saying by buying this or that etc etc how much is too much how little is too little all the xpectation surrounded around a gift often overshadows the gift itself its really quite fascinating and also quite sad
socialism,removed,ugh another persons opinion no way socialism
socialism,removed,its pretty ridiculous to not include marxism and the national question by stalin in this
socialism,removed,economies compete with each other the system the soviet union attmpeted lost out to better options
socialism,removed,in all honesty the only viable solution would be a presidential candidate and not know what aleppo is
socialism,removed,the works people have suggested connollys luxemburgs and stalins were extremely influential worldwide for decades and were written by people actually involved in historical proletarian revolutions by contrast ive never heard of this peter hadden guy whose essay is the first on this list though a google search tells me was an irish leading cadre of the cwi an organisation which many mods of this sub belong to talk about pet article
socialism,removed,thought this was rthedonald when i read the title stay classy rsocialism
socialism,removed,i dont have to attend your reading group to criticise the reading list part of the reason why i dont come is cause i get bored of these discussions between newbies and trots not that theres anything inherently wrong with either of those things ive attended more than i can count in real life when i was a militant myself again i dont see any reason why you should add this petter hadden guy to the reading list other than publicise your own organisation its the same as how the cwi and other trot orgs operate in real life where reading groups are not held for the honest goal of genuine research but to painfully explain your position and recruit people its a shame cause i was really happy to see you initially base this discussion group around the communist research clusters volumes which were explicitly put together against this sectarian culture httpscommunistresearchclusterwordpresscomwhatistobedone
socialism,removed,the revolution is comin any day now guys im sure these workers want to abolish private enterprise as opposed to get some more money to spend in the free market
socialism,removed,flay em and use their fat to feed the needy
socialism,removed,why the fuck do you care reactionary piece of shit socialists are feminists or sjws go join the fascists
socialism,removed,you werent allowed into the rsoc discord for a reason bud
socialism,removed,you say you want lgbt rights but also respect muslims you are a sheep like a follower of hitler
socialism,removed,congratulations youve managed to ignore my entire comment and repeat your comrades points in an even more delusional manner i bet he gets to do more leadoffs than you at branch meetings youre delusional to think your organisations fulltimer is important to the subject and to expect me to have heard of him while you didnt even think luxemburg was worth adding youre delusional to paint me as the excluding sectarian bully for just writing comments which never even asked you to remove the reading since i dont attend these discussions but were simply criticising poblachts hypocrisy and the collective egotism of the modern left
socialism,removed,for anyone who has bothered to read this chain of comments keep in mind that the russian duma had only come into existence in like other legislative bodies formed under an autocrat it lacked power at its founding ask yourself however if the wars revolutions and starvations that led like all such events to a new authoritarian government served the people of russia better than fived decades of political resistance from within the duma would have
socialism,removed,oh so we should focus on the reality then of what actually happened oops
socialism,removed,well that turned out well
socialism,removed,httpwwwcheapsexynightgirlscom
socialism,removed,bigotry ableism and hate speech will be met with immediate bans thats the gayest fucking autism ive ever heard this subreddit is not for questioning the basics of socialism i stand corrected obviously obtuse or asinine questions will be assumed to be trolling and will be removed and can result in a ban god forbid you educate the uneducated ban me you dense cunts fuckin do it
socialism,removed,using violence to silence people that have different opinions thats totally not fascist at all
socialism,removed,first i am a pacifist so im predisposed to being against violence violence is a tool of oppressors by celebrating this act of violence we are encouraging more violence for example a similar incident happened at a milo yiannopoulos event but the results were a bit different the person who wanted to punch a nazi ended up getting shot second richard spencer claims he doesnt selfidentify as a nazi neonazi or white supremacist i know that he has used language identified with nazis and white supremacists so i understand that there are justifications for believing he is a nazi and a white supremacist but he doesnt selfidentify as those things those are labels other people have put upon him one reason i assume people call him a nazi and white supremacist – other than the fact that he uses language associated with those groups – is so they can dehumanize him and rationalize violence against him personally i like to keep in mind that he doesnt have any power hes a blogger he was attacked for his ideas and attacking people for their ideas is a tactic that has been used against socialists
socialism,removed,whos the bigger fascist the man who is peacefully expressing an opinion or the man who attacks him to keep him from peacefully expressing his opinion
socialism,removed,unless he is actually committing an act of violence then nobody has the right to commit an act of violence against him
socialism,removed,no an act of violence is punching someone in the head
socialism,removed,the problem is that the frustrations and action are being directed toward identity politics watch noam chompskys requiem for the american dream on netflix moving the frustrated into identity politics against one another is a tactic used by the elite and divides us all hence the divisive reaction of shaming if the movement were solely focus on words rights and the problem of money in politics then the movement would unite all unfortunately its focused on identity and gender
socialism,removed,it said white lives matter too much not really going to win many over with that one
socialism,removed,tolerance of the left in action
socialism,removed,youre really justifying going down to his level though
socialism,removed,this is really dumb
socialism,removed,socialist and communists really need to research the economic side of college if they want to ever be taken seriously they wont its always nice to yell things until your ideas produce breadlines
socialism,removed,how does socialism connect to postscarcity
socialism,removed,this seems too much like a meme subreddit lol
socialism,removed,yes when you look at it like that capitalism is just basically enslaving others to get rich but in a capitalistic model anyone can be rich so technically it is fair is it not if i became rich using capitalism i would want to keep my money so that i could do the most good with it
socialism,removed,never said all capitalist states are identical dumbass just made the point that the ussr and the usa had the same class system and therefore similar amounts of worker rights
socialism,removed,why thats my goal is to live in a a society where everyone lives in excess however technically capitalism works nobody is stopping the poor oppressed person from becoming a millionaire the thing is most people these days would rather complain and villainize the rich i dont think thats moving us forward to that kind of society that we both envision i want to live in a society where home and food are guaranteed but who is going to work the hard jobs and who is going to work the easy jobs the only way that kind of society would work is if everyone runs on passion and does everything out of the goodness of their heart i dont think humanity is ready for that also what happens to creativity for example if everyone lives in the same house what if i want a different bigger house by the ocean or something none of that is really possible in a socialist society
socialism,removed,god damn your stupidity is painful to those who wish you no harm
socialism,removed,rfullcommunism
socialism,removed,yeah look at any socialist country the poorest are the ones screwed over the most the elites are still elite and gain even more power for example venezuela china russia cuba north korea id much rather be lower class in a capitalist society
socialism,removed,if unskilled workes dont have access to food the population crisis will solve it self and we end up with a more educated population too free market solving a problem once again
socialism,removed,whats the profit margin for fast food franchise owners oh thats right it doesnt fit the narrative
socialism,removed,begging is your only option
socialism,removed,some people dont really have passions and would be content to just watch netflix all day everyday perhaps they arent lazy but they are unlikely to pursue any sort of passion left to their own devices
socialism,removed,lol democracy in the work place when youve put in an equal share of money up for the startup costs and expenses then you are entitled to a say in how the business is run
socialism,removed,yeah i work at hardees and want money so give me money please thank you
socialism,removed,so what about immigration isnt that fucking over the wages of americans too
socialism,removed,why are you not against immigration nothing helps the bad bad capitalists more with driving down wages
socialism,removed,youre forgetting they took the risks and started those companies they dont owe you anything other than what youre willing to get paid without the rich you wouldnt have jobs
socialism,removed,psychopaths
socialism,removed,fast food workers deserve profit sharing maybe managers but everybody can get bent too funny
socialism,removed,the average cuban couldnt read his long as caption
socialism,removed,we should punish successful businesses owners for making money how dare they establish a profitable business plan while staying relevant and affordable for todays average consumer anyone who makes more money than other people is bad
socialism,removed,or dont work at a job designed for teenagers
socialism,removed,literally nobody said anything about being neutral please read the other comments i made which address you comment
socialism,removed,im not necessarily looking to debate just making a statement which shouldnt be so scary like i said why sit in your own echo chamber
socialism,removed,fuuuuuck off just because a year old whos working the job of a year old wants more money because they cant get a better job thats right for them doesnt mean we need to raise minimum wage and make me and other peopl with better jobs pay more for grocery and goods in america fuck them
socialism,removed,to be fair the only people that have control over how companies spend their money is said companies do you really think these billionaires are going to give up their multiple homes and their golden thrones so we dont live in shitholes raising the minimum wage will cause them to either raise prices or employ less people
socialism,removed,working at a fast food restaurant does not deserve a wage that can support a family its a first jobtraining groundstepping stone
socialism,removed,most of the time the workers have no idea how to run a business there is a reason skilled leaders can demand ao much compensation but of course everyone thinks they could do their ceos job
socialism,removed,i think socialism cannot work in their labor
socialism,removed,i dont really have to act or think in any certain way i definitely dont have to accept an illegitimate election given foreign money hacking and influence peddling or the voters that created it i disagree that i have to give these people anything but the finger in reality it will be a good thing to let trump burn it all to the ground yea its horrible and people will die and the country may never be the same its not a nest i made the more i think about it fuck these imbeciles
socialism,removed,take it no you have to want it and deserve it
socialism,removed,exactly the reality is they should have stayed in school if youre and earning min wage there were some choices made in your life that were not the best
socialism,removed,oh hey its simple fucking economics
socialism,removed,hes right though higher wages just give them more incentive to invest in automation which would save them a lot of money in a few years
socialism,removed,are you typing from venezuela how s the food comrade
socialism,removed,wow muh not real communism argument how many times it has to be tried and how many more millions have to die before you believe its real
socialism,removed,dont comment to me again unless you are capable of reading what i said to users that said the same thing before you also you are sounding like a broken record you said the exact same thing in the comment before this i never said the words neutral or objectivity if its too hard to read what i said to other users without injecting your own interpretations into it which have nothing to do with what is written then perhaps this thread isnt for you
socialism,removed,profits that we produced this cant be real is this real unskilled bottompole laborers claiming they are the reason the business is profitable no the business owner and evil ceo gave you a fucking job be happy you arent jobless if you think you create profits go start your own business and wait for people that havent put in of the sleepless nights and risk youve put into a company to tell you that they deserve what you have fuck off i cant stand things like this
socialism,removed,do you know what it takes to start a business do you know the risk ceos take when they invest their lifes work into something for most ceos that business is their lifes work not just a passing job they are taking that they dont care about low skilled workers ie the ones at the bottom of the totem pole are replaceable simple as that it boils down to supply and demand for most companies if you disperse what the ceo makes to the employees whats that going to be maybe dollar a head week maybe im missing whats actually going on here but it seems to me a sense of entitlement that employees have where they believe the company owes them something if you think a company isnt treating you fairly quit fucking complaining go get a marketable skill and do something about it or better yet if you think the ceo is selfish do what they probably did when they were at the bottom of the totem pole either start their own company and become the ceo or fucking work harder than people like you that would rather complain
socialism,removed,mine would be reproducing with abby just poppin out our own revolutionary army
socialism,removed,what time did the general population play more then work who is even saying you cant do this now there is no rule saying you need to work certain hours for a certain company for a certain amount of your life
socialism,removed,you go create a company put in years of hard work then go hand it off to the people working for you haha you people are absolutely insane this sub is filled with a bunch of edgy yo that have no idea what hard work is
socialism,removed,why dont you go create a company put in years of hard work then hand it off to your workers yea totally see why this would work s
socialism,removed,i have never seen this sub after reading posts and comments you can tell its filled with edgy teenagers who havent worked to build something in their lives the idea that someone should sacrifice their life to create a business just to hand it off to workers is so asinine
socialism,removed,no he is saying you should live within your means i worked fast food for years i enjoyed what i did and the people i shared time with but knew financially it wasnt where i wanted to stay so i learned a new skill and got my foot in the door at a company to start my career life is what you make it if you dont want to live a sub par life dont choose a sub par life
socialism,removed,these people are nuts you cannot reason with them they are convinced we had it so much better years ago when thousands were dying from desease and poverty
socialism,removed,lol get mad bro im listening but your logic is completely flawed your making shit up cost of living depends on where you live or the kind of life you want to live you choose there are people that choose to farm and live that kind of life its filled with boring tasks not a whole lot of fun farming and raising live stock and you have the worry of will this crop aurvive will i have enough food live stock capitalism has given us all the kind of luxury that our ancestors would and did fight and die for
socialism,removed,we have the internet we have so many resources at our finger tips i worked fast food i worked a factory job i was happy to do it because it raised my l quality of life that was the trade off i decided i didnt want to do that anymore i learned new skill i took a part time job learning helpdesk and it launched my career every successful person i talk to has the same story they didnt settle they saw what they wanted and figured out a path for them to get to it they learned the skill that the company was looking for some people are born poor many people die of starvation everyday thats why i find it strange that people fight the system that has brought more people out of poverty then ever before my mom still lives in a trailer my sister married a millionaire i dont see any of that money and i dont need to he was in school for years and started his own company he did the work he did more work then im willing to do when he was growing up in new york he shared a room with his brothers life is what you make it dont expect people to give you everything
socialism,removed,there is no gaurentee in anything you do ever capitalism has been the most successful economic idea we have had ever has brought more people into prosperity created the most wealth socialism creates exsactly what you dont want a few rich elites with all the power and money
socialism,removed,joy reid is a giant fucking moron
socialism,removed,the social democracies of europe and scandinavia have survived a long time and generally provide a better quality of life than pure capitalism ayn rand style unfettered capitalism has virtually always resulted in plutocracy and widespread suffering to support an elite minority the extremes of government pure capitalism and pure communism do not work as well as intermediate social democracies providing for some income redistribution to prevent heritable wealthy dynasties there is less incentive for hard work at the extremes
socialism,removed,in monopoly there is a finite amount of moves able to be made property buildings etc and that is uch different from how the world operates we dont play in a zero sum game there will always be oppertunity not to say it ismt easier to succeed if you already have the capital but to act like there is only a limited anount of wealth is illogical
socialism,removed,because creating a business isnt like getting a job there is huge risk involved a lot of startup costs you took the risk and out in more hours then anyone you should reap the most rewards anyone can be a janitor not everyone has the skill sets to be it director
socialism,removed,youre dumb not wasting my time
socialism,removed,fuck you i do what i want
socialism,removed,didnt you faggots try this shit in and it failed horribly lmaoing ur lives
socialism,removed,nope youre not fascist at all
socialism,removed,whats it like to constantly lose non stop i mean cuba will be liberated soon better plan a quick holiday there
socialism,removed,i think the grammar outrages me more than anything else
socialism,removed,it doesnt matter if it was bombed by russia because on reddit theyd find a way to make america have done it
socialism,removed,what like out of breath tired or exhausted like a southern belle who might collapse upon the fainting couch at any moment do you need a nonpatriarchal antiimperialist safe space to regroup and regain your nerves
socialism,removed,do these wealthy people hold power in the presence of big government or the absence of it its pretty obvious what id argue but above all else i dont think rich people can play the system without first exploiting government its why its hard to arrest rich people they can pay off the judicial system judicial branch of government its why its easy for rich people to pass laws in their favor the legislative branch and the last fear would be rich people using their big guns to dominate everyone else this would also be a failure of government preventing initiation of force against innocent people id love to hear a case for why business owners can be more sinister than a government but id love it even more if someone could prove to me how business owners can be more sinister in a deregulated environment and without government lobbying
socialism,removed,and imagine what horrors go on in communist north korea its terrible when businesses do it but when socialist governments get in the mix
socialism,removed,oh no i think this is terrible and indefensible but at least private companies can face stiff punishments when governments do it to their own people theres no punishment for them at least until the people manage to rise up and overthrow them
socialism,removed,thought this was nk at first and was going to suggest orbital nuclear strike to eliminate needless suffering seeing as its south korea it explains the rise in popularity of sea salt in the us recently
socialism,removed,its soo easy when you can just nitpick the good outcomes
socialism,removed,what then why are the poorest countries the ones with the highest level of government and historically why are the countries that have had the highest gains in prosperity free
socialism,removed,my parents didnt sign a permission trip for this feel trip
socialism,removed,all you have to do is tell the tankies to fuck off and never associate with them ever again they give the capitalists all the ammunition they need to tear us down
socialism,removed,how does he have money to make cotton candy but not to buy food surely theres something he could be selling in a war torn land that wont bankrupt his family
socialism,removed,in every single one of those countries you will find a great dearth of public services corruption at every level and a lack of enforcement except for the richest of its citizens these are the libertarian paradises of your dreams this is what an absence of government looks like in a capitalist world and pretty much all these countries are in africa where they lack the availability of cheap sources of energy you aware that africa is abundant in natural resourcesright the difference is they dont have the means to extract these resources and use them in a way to jump start an economy im just going to work with your definition of free less government the wealthiest countries throughout history have been those which are most efficiently able to use their military prowess to gain resources imperialism and those which most effectively exploit the labor of the lowest class slaves serfs workers etc that is true for the persians romans chinese and most of western europe in the last years it in fact requires a large degree of government in the form of imperial oppression and the protection of private property that is essentially the right to profit off of the slaveserfworkers labor via the sword or gun im not sure what youre arguing here on on hand you say that wealthy can only be acquired in instances of high levels of government you know im against big government you know this but still you try and argue this point and its pretty laughable private property is theft and capitalism is slavery it is anything but voluntary or free without government assuming spontaneous order would arise workers would naturally be able to enjoy the fruits of their own labor something you probably claim to be for well to start marxs labor theory of value is simply incorrect we know now through hundreds of years of buying and selling in markets that value is something thats subjective marx argued that the value tied to any product has to be directly related to the necessary societal labor put into the product this is inherently wrong for the reason i stated for example if i sold a product as a cashier for dollars and it took me minutes to ring the customer upso the equation is one ten dollar product the labor value of minutes of workwe know that it cant be possible for the cashiers labor to be valued at dollars because if that were the case the product wouldnt be sold in the first place the employer wouldve never known to allocate resources in certain ways if he didnt know if he would profit or not profit is thought to be an evil termwhen in reality profit is just a market signal that youre allocating resources correctly another easy way i can show you that value is subjective is take a gold watch one person might look at it and say id pay dollars for thatand another person might say i wouldnt pay a dime for itthats why value is subjected and not tied to labor hours people value things differently but on different oxymoronic note why is it that socialists berate people who argue for the right to life and the right to property arguing that these so called rights are figments of our imagination and dont existbut when it comes to things like food shelter and welfare things that are the result of human production socialists will say these are indeed rights its super ironic to say the least i used to be a rightwing libertarian im going to be very blunt with you i know you think you know everything but youre extremely politically and historically ignorant your narrative is pure ideology read and learn a little about socialism and real anarchism and find out what it really is i probably understand marxism better than you do budin fact i debate marxists literally all the time i live in denverits a very progressive city in fact do the know the amount of marxists that dont know that a post scarcity communistic society was what marx ultimately envisioned and that he didnt even necessarily hate capitalism but saw capitalism as the best system of its time and from there it was a progression to socialism than communism
socialism,removed,considering they werent even working toward achieving communism in the slightest
socialism,removed,why should anyone critically support the north korean regime when it advertises its labour force as being the cheapest and most competitive around and exports it around the world for corporations to make even more profit
socialism,removed,great so now you agree that the wealth of a country has nothing to do with the power of the government but material conditions thats literally not what you stated youre stating that people cannot be wealthy without a large government in place is this all way over your head or can you not follow your own train of thought no thats what your ideological filter translated what i said as material conditions allow for imperialism and the systematic exploitation of labor that is historically how wealthy countries get wealthy imperialism throughbig military expenditures you know libertarians are against this right because im trying to get through your thick skull that rich capitalist countries and every wealthy nation or empire throughout history are in fact not free and rely on a great deal of violence and coercion to be wealthy for the ruling class could you be more specific how do people end up being violent through voluntary interactions please tell me why you think private property holders are entitled to the profits generated by workers youre asking the wrong question would workers have work without the employer first setting up the business in the first place and do you honestly believe that ceos or any manager in a company is basically the equivalent of the monopoly guy and sits around and doesnt really do anything ceos have an extremely important jobthey make all the important decisions and ultimately all the liability is on them i just want some intellectual discourse from you is all another great show of humility from a rightwing libertarian on the internet who read a couple paragraphs on wikipedia again with the intellectual discourse id love some

socialism,removed,bourgeoisie get the wall petite bourgeoisie get a free all expense paid trip to siberia
socialism,removed,dare you to go out and say petite bourgeoisie while trying to get people interested in socialism no one will listen to you socialism isnt gaining ground because most socialists seem to be stuck in the past you use all the outdated terminology and try to excuse red imperialism like the ussr and you say that a small business owner for example someone who owns a deli and could be struggling to make ends meet deserves to be sent to a fucking prison camp if i could send every tankie cunt to the wall myself i would your blood on the wall would be the only red thing about you
socialism,removed,we really need to stop this conflating words like cunt as sexist without a sexist context or intent its an insult thats widely used to address men and women donald trump is a cunt hillary clinton is a cunt context and intent is very important when determining whether the words like this are sexist we also dont apply the same rules to words like dick for instance there are guardian journalists calling men dicks regularly who then claim the word cunt in itself is sexist its a clear hypocrisy
socialism,removed,a predictable end for socialism in venezuela
socialism,removed,yeah thats the way people on here usually argue against this no its sexist but i cant explain why so ill just mock you its not a tired argument its being able to think logically a word that is used to insult both men and women is not sexist this is a genuine case of the regressive left on this sub the authoritarian socialists that take offence to everything and strip context intent from things like sexism or racism and all you can summon to argue against this is thats a tired argument
socialism,removed,are you seriously suggesting this is a no true scotsman fallacy that makes literally no sense in this context its hilarious how logic goes out the window when it comes to issues of free speech or what isisnt offensivesexist etc you remove logic context intent to take offensive to unoffensive things if cunt is sexist why is it used for men too and why does this not apply to dick its a clear double standard that exposes the superficial thinking in regards to this issue
socialism,removed,americans love being tough when it comes to sports or war but were a bunch of pussies when it comes to fighting for worker rights

socialism,removed,you realize that trump speech was just about equality and democracy isnt equality the pivot of all the socialism ideology
socialism,removed,you guys know you are retarded right if being the product of capitalism means a ton of money and a banging hot wife then sign me up socialism has and will always fail human nature is to always want more hence why capitalism works i shouldnt give up my money and drive to want to make money just because others are lazy

socialism,removed,trump is our savior from this kind of bullshit i am so looking forward to the next years
socialism,removed,youre all fucked in the head rule two intrinsically i welcome banishment
socialism,removed,since when do market economies have the government rationing electricity and groceries i like to sometimes think that maybe the people rooting for socialism arent completely retarded and have a well researched view of their opinions especially since a scary number of people are rooting to throw out what this country was founded on in order to go down the same rout as the ussr then there are people like you that come up and instead of defending a clear example of socialism you try to claim no thats not my socialism you sound like a north korean propaganda rag
socialism,removed,cough cough httpsenwikipediaorgwikivenezuela
socialism,removed,honest question where has socialism ever worked
socialism,removed,the government cannot ration goods that pass from citizen to citizen if they are rationing it it implies that it is the governments property and the government is distributing it to their citizens
socialism,removed,you guys are all fools socialism and its most vile manifestation ie communism have killed more people in the twentieth century than any capitalist or right wing form of government ever could people who advocate for what you guys believe in are worse than the nazis ever could be
socialism,removed,way to hit rall you commie bastards careful you dont wake the normies at this hour next thing you know theyll be looking at scandinavia and wondering why north korea is in the news all the time but nobody has said anything about cuba between the cold war ending and castros death
socialism,removed,socialism you mean that thing that doesnt work
socialism,removed,theres plenty of socialist countries this isnt one of them get over it
socialism,removed,all it took was the deaths of literally millions of innocent people
socialism,removed,its always the people who contribute the least that want socialism go figure
socialism,removed,sick yall want free shit cool
socialism,removed,nothing your logic is the very reason no true form of socialism has worked or ever will work
socialism,removed,i know you guys love your no true scotsman thing but every political and economic system is a gradient particularly when your ideology can technically never be fully realized until its worldwide sure its not socialism or even democratic socialism but its further along on the gradient weve seen what happens when you try to radically change things from the ground up overnight violent bloody revolutions you should hold countries that have peacefully implemented more socialistlite policies and prospered under them up as a proof of concept rather than saying well theyre not really socialists otherwise youre just going to have the hundredmilliondeathtoll of the great leap forward and similarly disheartening figures from the ussr thrown at you with no counterpoint bernie sanders wouldnt have rallied any support if hed actually preached socialism but he managed to sell a lot of people on a message that was at least further along on the gradient
socialism,removed,building a strawman is funny but really doesnt persuade anyone
socialism,removed,tax the rich feed the poor i get it doesnt matter if the currency fails
socialism,removed,tru i like the part where over million people died
socialism,removed,you people are fucking tyrants that need to be erased from this planet maga
socialism,removed,like the one in venezuela or the one who starved he working class in chile
socialism,removed,venezuela is by all means socialist they have seized the means of production and even fixed the prices saying venezuela is capitalist in any way is idiotic
socialism,removed,last time we had socialism we got the nazis shut the fuck up

socialism,removed,socialism is a lazy and innovation free state of mind
socialism,removed,you are the problem and the rope is the cure
socialism,removed,so all symbols of wealth should be destroyed do you have a smart phone a computer
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,stop race baiting it doesnt help your cause
socialism,removed,hard hitting if you are a liberal sure i mean the women who went to those marches didnt vote for trump and maybe not even the majority of white women all this does is adding another myth to the myriad liberals and democrats have created to explain the fuck up of clinton and the democratic party russians are to blame workers are to blame third partys are to blame now women are to blame as well but lets never blame clinton and the democrats for their own failures liberal subs can fawn over this picture as much as they like but i expect a bit more from a supposedly socialist forum
socialism,removed,to make it clear donald trump won the white woman demographic to clintons thats not a statistic we should be ignoring but to simplify that message to white women voted for trump seems incredibly divisive and alienates the of white women who didnt many of whom surely despise donald trump
socialism,removed,the whole face of the march was middle class hillary supporting white women that seems awfully reductive to me as if there were no other people out there what if it were true is our message to liberals simply fuck you this approach comes off to me as pessimistic dismissive and containing no potential to build anything its reactionary
socialism,removed,massacres committed by tak the terrorist organization httpsenmwikipediaorgwikikurdistanfreedomfalconsattacks nearly civilians killed by pkk in years pkk sympathizers celebrating the massacre of civilians on march a car bombing in the kizilay district of ankara killed civilians and injured more than others tak claimed responsibility for the attack on march suicide bombers in ankara are considered as heroes and glorified by the pyd in syria this picture was taken in the syrian town of almalikiyah on the flyer we got photos of the bombing perpetrators and the pkk founder abdullah öcalan at the suicide bombing on the busiest bus station of ankara people came to life and people were seriously injured source pkk training children to become suicide bombers killed wounded kurdish families demand the pkk stop kidnapping minors kurdish families claim kids kidnapped by pkk kurdish kids used by pkk terrorist organization httpwwwhabermonitorcomimgpkknincocuklaruzerindenyenitaktigijpg httpiimgurcomuhgyftmjpg turkey pkk kurdish communists burn schools in terror campaign pkks tak terrorist organization has claimed responsibility for forest fires in the west of turkeypropkk media report syrian kurdish forces razed arab villages pkks hdp members throwing kurdish party members from a bulding hdp mp pkk has the power to suffocate turkey with its spit pkk lynching kurdish people pkk burned a car because driver cant speak kurdish turks forced to pay kurds their electricity bills five civilians killed in pkk attack in southeastern turkey cough child soldiers child massacres of the pkk
socialism,removed,who are we appealing to who is taking race into consideration what organization is this because i dont see organization here i see individuals lashing out
socialism,removed,black woman generalizes an entire gender and race what does she get out of this sign its idiotic and divisive
socialism,removed,we shouldnt ignore reality or statistics but when theres clearly white women marching alongside you perhaps crafting a sign designed to shame white women is going to be more divisive than helpful yes white women voted for trump white women also voted for hillary white women also voted for bernie in the primaries white women also abstained from voting white women also voted for jill stein my point is as a white woman i damn sure didnt vote for trump
socialism,removed,this is not telling blm protesters not to protest this is telling blm protesters to not use signs that read white people are racist i support blm all the way i support the womens march i didnt vote for trump and i firmly antiracism and antifascist i am a white woman i understand that by being white i am given some measure of privilege in america but there are ways to make noise that dont insult your sisters and we are all sisters and brothers in this i may be a white woman but im also trans and i dont march around with signs that read cis women voted for trump remember every time we let them divide us by race or religion or gender or sexual orientation we are making their victory all the easier
socialism,removed,oh my god are you really pulling that reactionary criticism equals censorship nonsense with me no one is saying she cant wave a sign around like that people are questioning whether or not she should and maybe just maybe none of us should be shouting over anyone else if there are white people shouting over black people call them out but do not paint all white people with the same brush we are all in this together we should all start acting like it
socialism,removed,again divisive rhetoric does not make allies or comrades
socialism,removed,why donald trump got elected
socialism,removed,this isnt powerful it is hateful and divisive keep demonizing people for thinking differently and soon they will go out of their way to always vote against you
socialism,removed,you can always spot the asshole by waiting to see who utters the words white fragility
socialism,removed,take a look at thedonald sub and read what people say they are fed up with the pretentious hypocritical liberal arguments and trump capitalized on that i have seen this type of crap all over the media and social media to think that white males wouldnt get fed up is pretty silly considering the current situation we are in what good is being right if you arent effective
socialism,removed,black women voted for trump too im confused
socialism,removed,true but the poster says white women voted for trump not a majority of white women voted trump
socialism,removed,so did black women its ideology not skin color you buffoons
socialism,removed,you can delete this post the doxing was fake dont give validity to their actions
socialism,removed,great still doesnt change what the sign says
socialism,removed,their evidence was pretty shit i seriously doubt its the same guy they just doxxed some random fetish porn actor
socialism,removed,rsocialism today white women are bad rsocialism tomorrow why are there so few women here
socialism,removed,people think it was done by fictional pundit carl diggler which is absolutely hilarious
socialism,removed,messages like the one on that sign spread hatred and clearly promote the usvsthem mentality that is already so easily engaged in the human brain especially around issues that arouse peoples passions like these what is it possibly accomplishing beyond rousing more people to think yeah fuck white women hypocrites
socialism,removed,you are as lost as a trump supporter if you believe anything you just said
socialism,removed,so did disabled people poc the poor this silly kind of division in the ranks is not promoting solidarity rather than hating on the poor white trump supporter why dont we start saying i dont care who you voted for what can i do to help
socialism,removed,considering that the guys attacker is literally a shiteater i find him to be a much greater meme than some nazi getting clocked
socialism,removed,just a hint for the future not being a racist piece of shit helps getting taken more serious
socialism,removed,there are countless ways to have voiced the very important fact that black women have a unique experience that is often overlooked this is not one of those this is an unquestionably antagonistic sign
socialism,removed,yes white women who support a mans right to grab any woman by her private parts right just let me know if you support this orange liar ill grab you by the pussy its cool right
socialism,removed,yes what does that have to do with this sign this agitates allies not who we need to agitate it doesnt really educate because it leaves out any real numbers about a generalized fact most politically aware people already know and it doesnt organize because its going alienate white women who are part of the solution and for someone so taken aback by this subs hostility towards black people right now which i think is a misreading of the response to this sign im surprised that you someone apparently in tune with race issues dont see how this is racially divisive
socialism,removed,ah what a cunt i bet she thinks shes all clever as well the women all around you didnt you silly cow
socialism,removed,would you be ok with an angry white guy with a sign that said black women voted for obama
socialism,removed,its race baiting and its a big reason you all lost please continue for the next years
socialism,removed,dont know where you read that in my comment maybe im turning dyslexic i merely put coprophiliaphagia in the same category of mental illness as nazism neither are healthy
socialism,removed,in the past yes i have made sweeping indictments of all white people i never will be guilty of that again – as i know now that some white people are truly sincere that some truly are capable of being brotherly toward a black man the true islam has shown me that a blanket indictment of all white people is as wrong as when whites made blanket indictments against blacks malcolm x
socialism,removed,youve done nothing but be dismissive and ignorant and thats why you are being downvoted so much
socialism,removed,women of color should sort out their own issues before blaming white people
socialism,removed,your experience doesnt make you a special snowflake
socialism,removed,those people were criminals who were justifiably killed under the law no sympathy for them at all
socialism,removed,if you are going to fuck off because of a sign you were never in at all and youll never try to get in because its clear that youre not welcome the movement will stagnate and die congratulations on handing a win to the neo nazis
socialism,removed,shes
socialism,removed,too similar to trumps messages of division not a fan also not a white woman
socialism,removed,women pretending to care about womens rights wearing cat ears animalizing women what ablist scum mods please find their reddit accounts and ban them right away so they can never ever post on here and trigger me further i am so pissed right now
socialism,removed,no man the way to stop all these kids from dying is to sterilize all adults so then there are no children to die all these fucking kids keep fucking up the system because they dont like to stand in the bread lines bitches
socialism,removed,a brocialist is someone that deserves to go on the first train to the gulag they are so called socialists that are uncomfortable with feminism and have a problem with people that identify outside of their gender ie cisgender
socialism,removed,when youve had a successful revolution id imagine itd be kinda hard to break your ego down enough to do things by the book and this is not a flaw in socialist theory shouldnt the theory take into account human nature
socialism,removed,im not talking about the charities but the people who donate to charities that was a nice attempt at a straw man by the way how does the charitable person profit
socialism,removed,neither free markets nor profitmaking are inherently capitalist can you explain what you mean by inherently here because just like many socialists will argue that true socialism has never many capitalists will argue that true free marketlaissez faire capitalism has never existed and that state capitalism and welfare capitalism are just corruptions of this
socialism,removed,sorry i dont speak moron
socialism,removed,at least the kids from my school were as said i know ill be downvoted to oblivion but i stand by what i say sjws will get gulag in my book liberal scum
socialism,removed,triggered much
socialism,removed,how much can you meme about stalin was a state capitalist social democrat i feel like even leftcoms would get tired of that after some time
socialism,removed,first your counter about respectability outs you as a professional activist your brand of political opportunism is why we are so deeply distrusted by our class let the neoliberals fight their own battles our job must be introducing people to marxism showing them that were not nauseating students completely disconnected from working class material interests our highest priority is to our class and we have much bigger threats to our class right now
socialism,removed,a nice little story about socialism as tried in the real world httpwwweconliborglibraryencsocialismhtml
socialism,removed,no youre just not enough of a risk taker to follow your dreams
socialism,removed,come to france over here antifas mix in during any demonstration attack policemen who are basically just following orders and maintaining a peaceful atmosphere breaking anything that comes into their hands mostly public property and small shops things that leftists should cherish as they empower the lower classes and even attack other demonstrators their lack of balls is also pretty funny they only attack in large groups and flee when outnumbered furthermore they are only present in leftist demonstrations and never seem to oppose fascists
socialism,removed,the emma goldman quote is objectively conservative and borderline libertarian hugo chavez had a net worth of billion his daughter is still the richest person in venezuela the mikhail bakunin quote is objectively conservative antistatist
socialism,removed,the countries going down the shitter with huge reserves of oil its the governments fault mainly but there are ruling class people who have helped out too another case where nationalizing the means of production is a bad idea also an important lesson that capitalism is necessary in the transference to socialism honestly maderno should have just left it plain capitalist and regulated wageshours or just have it actually socialist but im not sure how you process all that oil without equipment which they probably dont have
socialism,removed,individual liberty and smaller government are both fundamental conservative principals so yes not sure what youre getting at here
socialism,removed,didnt know that the state seizing the means of production was antistate didnt know that marginalizing individual rights for the benefit of the people was individualism fascinating
socialism,removed,is there a point that youre trying to get at here
socialism,removed,absolutely baseless gibberish i only browse this sub because it is truly and insufferably fascinating how any presumably educated people could believe this
socialism,removed,were not supposed to talk about that here if you want to have me go over my reasons on another reddit thats fine im a leftist i believe in actual equality not neoliberal diversity
socialism,removed,trump supporters are not an indication of bigotry they are an indication of reactionaries opposing neoliberalism even only a small percentage is bigoted opposing racism separate from class opposes our interests we can only fight racism through our class
socialism,removed,how are they good if they are being fascists just because something has a title does not mean that title represents their actions
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,when its about organizing street protests against legitimately reactionary forces its good when its about inundating the left with an ideology that the right to free speech shouldnt be defended or that when it comes to speech and association might makes right then its bad if it involves people coming together to express outrage against reactionaries and capitalists its good if it involves people being manipulated to disrupt the speech and association of other anticapitalists or radical ecologists its bad theres no simple goodbad answer as it depends on the particular antifa protest and the reason for it there have been productive antifa demonstrations and there have been counterproductive ones id honestly rank the recent events in sacremento as counterproductive because however wellintentioned the protest the main result of that incident was that fascist groups were able to get their name and message out into the press for a brief moment not to diss the wellmeaning people who participated in that protest similarly antitrump protests where protestors yell fuck free speech only confuses people about the meaning of socialism and makes the american left appear like a bunch of bloodthirsty stalinists indeed the main reason antifa is problematic is the attitude we see in many of the posts in this thread that respect for freezepeach is some kind of liberal idealism rather than the bedrock of any future socialist society in fact advances in free speech rights are one of the few progressive gains of the century but they are under concerted attack by governments today httpsaeoncovideosfreespeechisvitaltohumanflourishingbutitsinadecadelongslump without the free flow of information and freedom of speech and association socialism will not be possible period a productive attitude towards justifying antifa would frame antifa actions as a counterprotest or another form of free speech and association rather than framing antifa as a kind of proletarian state apparatus that has the right to shut down any speech it deems inappropriate
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,are you fucking kidding im going to get downvoted to shit for this but he doesnt just have to vote in the general election how about for marijuana legalization which results in countless minorities in jail for no reason how about against the death penalty hes an apathetic hypocrite there is plenty to do besides voting but voting matters see donald trump and anyone who doesnt vote has that much less right to bitch

socialism,removed,sorry for the downvotes youre getting most subreddits are echo chambers and this one isnt exempt
socialism,removed,if you are legally permitted to vote do no exercise that right and then protest that the decision was not made for you in your favor you should be able to exercise your right to protest but you are still a cunt writeins third party candidates state amendments local offices there was plenty on every ballot worth voting for the fact that liberals dont vote is part of the reason why politicians dont cater to them as much as they could youre part of the problem bring on the downvotes
socialism,removed,grrrr racism is still prevalent in americawhy would i vote for a president who could potentially help this country end racism you live here fucking vote or leave
socialism,removed,i supported his decision to have a peaceful way of protesting but he lost my support when he didnt vote the two presidential candidates were not the only two on the ballet if he truly wanted change he would of done some research on somebodyanybody on that ballet and might of seen something he liked just my opinion of course i did not vote for either i went with johnson i didnt like either choice and didnt particularly like johnson either but we i wanted to show my resolve in trying to get an actual third party in the future
socialism,removed,its the sort of thing you see and hope youre either dreaming or missing out on the joke kind of like this place
socialism,removed,but the two generally come from the same people
socialism,removed,you forgot tom jons socialist cousin who didnt vote for either because he was too pure to try and get his hands dirty trying to stop trump tom can go and fuck himself too
socialism,removed,the most striking fact about weimar was not that the nazis managed to destroy the social democrats and the communists but that the traditional parties the conservative and liberal parties were hated and disappeared if somebody comes along who is charismatic and honest this country is in real trouble because of the frustration disillusionment the justified anger and the absence of any coherent response what are people supposed to think if someone says i have got an answer we have an enemy there it was the jews here it will be the illegal immigrants and the blacks noam chomsky
socialism,removed,no by marx and lenin and all the saints no if you believe people are getting killed you speak out against it
socialism,removed,theres no pick either every action even non voting will favour one of the two candidates in this case you have basically voted trump
socialism,removed,when malcolm x endorsed barry goldwater he was still into the nation of islam which is a bunch of racists so yes he could go and fuck himself too he then went travelling in the middle east and changed perspective and thats when he became credible in fact he was then intimidated and eventually killed by the noi
socialism,removed,its ironic that a webcomic ostensibly about the mistake of overgeneralizing people with a variety of beliefs into a single mold manages to do that very thing just into two different molds i know a number of prolife folks myself included who are neither uneducated nor read breitbart nor support the mistreatment of anyone for how they sexually identify this webcomic seems to think such people either do not exist or are terrible people for having a different philosophical take on a subject that has no scientific consensus nor can it it is a philosophical question i guess what im saying is it would be nice if people stopped making categorical assumptions about what people believe based upon stray facts like so and so is prolife or so and so voted for a gop candidate
socialism,removed,im posting this comment because i want to hear other thoughts and opinions on it and because my views are not rigid and i like to approach things from other perspectives i dont believe that abortion is right when done in cases to prevent harm to the mother or in emergencies its fine but i think that at conception you have started a process that marks the beginning of human life while i support the spread and use condoms and other forms of birth control because i truly believe women should have control of their own bodies i think that a baby should be allowed to live be adopted when the mother is able to have the baby and merely doesnt want to keep it is this a viewpoint that is inherently incompatible with leftist ideologies how do you guys deal with this line of thinking
socialism,removed,trump supporters are wrong the number of republican votes stayed more or less constant compared to past elections whereas the democrats stayed at home therefore any nonvote is a trump vote i voted no one by not voting because i think both candidates are absolutely useless to the emancipation of the working class and abolition of the subjugation of marginalized people in modern society you were not voting on whether to emancipate the working class that sadly wasnt on the menu you were voting on whether to stop a madman who is literally bringing nazis into the white house and you let it happen you cant skirt responsibility like that i repeat look up how the nazis took power and the fighting between communists and liberals that let it happen
socialism,removed,pathetic attempt at running away from an argument with a humorous ad hominem you dont know me you dont know whether i am a liberal or not
socialism,removed,kill a pregnant woman double homicide kill the baby but not her homicide abort the baby perfectly fine
socialism,removed,oh my god how can you be so incapable of conceptualizing something you dont believe people who are against abortion as a moral issue believe that it is murder the killing of an innocent are you so nonchalant about the idea of a clinic where you can go to get your infant euthanized what about your toddler would that be your business the response appropriate for someone who believes what you believe is to try to convince the other that the fetus is not a person not to arrogantly and dismissively tell them murder is none of their business
socialism,removed,people who understand economics
socialism,removed,so youre going to threaten a part of society nice
socialism,removed,youre right its about a strawman
socialism,removed,why cant someone be prosocialism and prolife
socialism,removed,but banning comments goes against freedom of speech
socialism,removed,huh thats disappointing
socialism,removed,wat
socialism,removed,and those we need to vigorously oppose yes anyone who reads breitbart needs fucked to death
socialism,removed,is this satire
socialism,removed,god damn my filter button is getting worn out these days eventually ill block enough faggots and filter enough faggot subs to make reddit usable
socialism,removed,in practice youve spent the last eight years telling both that theyre racist morons who should be prevented from ever having a platform
socialism,removed,stay salty mod
socialism,removed,please keep this attitude up it lost you this year it will lose you more elections in the future
socialism,removed,you guys actually think socialism will work or is this just a meme subreddit or is your dream scenario being lord of the commie favela in venezuela
socialism,removed,michelle and jon both agree that taking peoples stuff and redistributing it while grabbing a juicy cut is not morally just at all both michelle and jon dont want to talk to a bunch of socialists and happily go along their way without stealing money
socialism,removed,how do you plan to recruit rural white people call them all racist garbage that benefit from white privilege i can tell you right now that wont work
socialism,removed,not person born unborn whatever even dying has the right to use anothers body to survive without their consent sure they do a conjoined twin cant cut off their sibling without their consent in the case of sharing a major organ this is using anothers body to survive
socialism,removed,you mean understand im sure the parts i dont understand will explain how socialists kindly ask for taxations instead of forcing them from unwilling people if that is the case then i guess i was mistaken
socialism,removed,saying meaningless things isnt an argument money is an illusion no money is currency fiat money is intrinsically worthless currency with a value decided by a combination of markets and government nbsp value is created by labor among other things value can be created by labor yes value in general is given by an actor with a desire for it nbsp property is theft no property is ownership without involuntary interaction property is also the ownership of ones own actions and decisions a thief in that sense does not own the things he steals but he does own the decision and the action to steal for example if i were to write a song i do not own the words of the song but i do own the intellectual and creative process by which i wrote this song and anything done with this song against my will is theft nbsp but here is a song to accompany your socialist musings
socialism,removed,classes arent a thing theyre imaginary boundaries created by people and have no meaning beyond our words
socialism,removed,what about bill bill hates corporatocracy and opposes unnecessary war bill takes a long hard look at hillary clintons history and decides she doesnt represent him or the people bill also likes to be diligent in his political research and tries not to be swayed by sensationalist media bill doesnt necessarily agree with trump but trusts him more than clinton bill bets on a wildcard instead of a lying cheating warmongering corporate shill
socialism,removed,but what if im the male version of michelle and voted trump
socialism,removed,whats so obvious about it dudes not even sworn in yet
socialism,removed,im not going to look through a bunch of socialist crap just to find an answer to one simple question does socialism rely on the use of force to achieve their aim or not
socialism,removed,do you not find this frustrating ive been finding lately that socialist as well as communist subs are becoming stifling because of the moral authoritarianism going on in most of them the two people that were banned in this thread and edited their comments to post about the ban seemed like they were contributing more to actual discussion than most of the other posts it seems pretty small minded to ban everyone who disagrees with you and ultimately that behavior is what makes a lot of subs functionally useless
socialism,removed,if you think of a fetus as a person and that its in and should be in the governments rights to disallow killing people then its perfectly reasonable to oppose the legalization of abortion its not the womans rights being stomped on any more than its a killers rights being unjustifiably limited from murder being illegal its a perfectly sound logical progression whereas the gay thing has no logical grounding and is based purely on fabrication and probably hatredfearignorance
socialism,removed,nice response just interjecting that the crime rate hypothesis has been all but disproven it was really just conjecture in the first place there are other factors that contributed to the drop in crime rate that far out way anything that abortions did contributors such as leaded gasoline being phased out of the market lead poisoning destroys the portion of the brain that is responsible for impulse control
socialism,removed,letting a newborn or child die while itd under your primary care is called criminal neglect and its super illegal people under our law do in fact have the responsibility of maintaining the life of the dependent and that legal responsibility reaches far being just maintaining life even if that means giving it to someone elses care the right to lifesupport was guaranteed to you and all people currently living in the united states in their early lives if not also before birth depending on decade i dont think youre quite accurate in the foundation of your point
socialism,removed,you guys are getting raped by the system and tricked into asking for more its fascinating really
socialism,removed,what about people who speak out against the moderators just banning opinions that they find inconvenient do those people get banned too or is it just the people holding those opinions
socialism,removed,lots of assumptions here about jon lets say jon was raised in a heavily religious household perhaps even home schooled he has never met someone who was homosexual or was in a position to require an abortion at all let alone in the third trimester it seems he an michelle get along rather well why assume hes some kind of monster hes just the product of a perfectly acceptable upbringing that happens to have some glaring omissions in understanding
socialism,removed,yeah jon jesus abortion is fine and should be bought with your tax money and your not allowed a veiw point on gay marrige go directly to gulag do not pass go and do not collect
socialism,removed,listen im seeing all types of views and bad things going around reddit and donald trump let me explain something all these bad things posted about him like the abortions the rape accusations grabbing women by the pussy ect again so many bad things people post about donald trump and he became our president thats how bad hillary clinton was donald trump didnt become president because hes donald trump no no donald trump became president because of who he wasnt so please i dont mind people talk down about him he wasnt my first choice either but lets be realistic here there is a reason he won in the first place and it wasnt because of white america like the media says it was because of hillarys email server and before you start typing but the fbi said it was fine thats not whats at stake here hillary undermined bernie sanders everything hillary did this election including paying protesters paying the media getting questions fed during campaigns a massive investigation where people needed immunity you wouldnt need immunity if there was nothing done wrong if the email server never existed we would have never known any of that stuff and it would have all stayed behind the scenes the real loser here wasnt hillary clinton it was bernie sanders
socialism,removed,not all trump voters are uneducated white people more hispanics and blacks voted for trump than romney my circle of college educated friends mostly all voted for trump
socialism,removed,literally no
socialism,removed,is this implying that classes would dissolve with socialism chill with the koolaid
socialism,removed,jon is also a nonsensical straw man thinks gay people are science experiments who should be shocked thats maybe of the population and to purport that theyre everyone who opposes socialism is ignorant
socialism,removed,there are doctors who disagree with first term abortions theyd say the same about your viewpoint
socialism,removed,well at least you arent bunching everyone together and calling them racist so its progress
socialism,removed,serious question is this a parody sub or do you people actually believe this
socialism,removed,if you dont sell socialism how do you get others on board or do you just force them into it because you know better than them
socialism,removed,telling someone to go fuck himself isnt a very good way to start a discussion that could actually lead to change instead you are being hostile which only demonstrates how imature many here are hostility leads to more hostility
socialism,removed,woo woo woo did you just use reactionary propoganda bro thats not pc not pc
socialism,removed,stay salty mod
socialism,removed,im sorry but this is some yankee bullshit my hometown voted for trump and the vast majority of them are both of these minus the grew up with money part this is not the reality at all and will keep leftists not familiar with these communities looking for some perfect victim of the white working class that simply does not exist people are complicated and narratives like this are condescending in their simplification im so sick of my hometown and other places in the midwest and south being poverty porn for a bunch of grad students and urban leftists who just do not understand what it is like and project this creepy romantic view of the white working class that just shows how little they know if youre not from a place like this if you havent lived with people like this i give fuck all about your stupid immaterial outreach strategy sorry to be so hostile but im so sick of stuff like this
socialism,removed,so a fetus doesnt deserve protection of their life but a convicted murderer does does the false equivalency not just make your head explode
socialism,removed,rkillthosewhodisagree there are people whod say the same thing about socialists needing lead injections and it doesnt make them any more right in their impotent rage theres no need for such vitriol nor hatred in kind
socialism,removed,a retard socialist making an argument using two very black and white examples for something that is usually pretty grey off yourself bud
socialism,removed,i assume that you are in your early as you are talking about making minimum wage so let me give you the perspective of someone a little older im pushing first being a landlord is a pain in the ass second there is no conspiracy to push people it is just simple economics one buys rental properties as an investment for your future and attempts to earn what they can now regarding the minimum income that effects everyone when you buy a home your mortgage approval will be based in part buy how much you can pay each month depending on your incomedebt ratio it is about of your monthly income so while you are renting you should try to make your rent about of your monthly income so that you can be saving that difference towards the down payment for first home purchase so whereas income to x your income is a bit extreme you should be imposing your own limit of keeping your rent at about of your monthly income good luck
socialism,removed,other than social liberals i dont see any theyre all corporate neocon elitists this democratic socialist liberal cant relate to your assertion
socialism,removed,i love jon oliver and support him here sorry but hes right in saying that hillary is far better than trump
socialism,removed,liberals are not the same a fascists but our concern is liberals because liberals are in power the rightwing reaction to liberals is just that a reaction the answer to this problem is not to embrace liberalism that of all things would only embolden them more we should strive to build and support an alternative option for people who are interested in actual solutions to their problems minus all the racistsexist rage the democratsliberals will not provide that sufficiently that is our job frankly i dont understand your objection to this idea coming from a socialist point of view
socialism,removed,i invite you to go onto the bastions of liberals on reddit be rhillaryclinton renoughsandersspam or renoughtrumpspam the liberals are openly hostile to socialists and argue against them like theyre right wingers liberals are not our comrades and do not remotely have the same goals as us liberals economic policies fuel right wing populism
socialism,removed,ancaps are not fascists theyre not our allies liberals are not fascists theyre not our allies conservatives are not fascists they are not our allies the common thread is that all three are focused on upholding capitalism and doing so inevitably leads to collapse and the rise of fascism
socialism,removed,conservatives definitely will fall into the nationalist traditionalist crap and ancraps from what ive seen on the anarcho capitalism sub are quickly accelerating towards becoming full fledged alt right so youre not particularly wrong
socialism,removed,i understand what youre saying about how liberals are less openly reactionary than the alt right and youre right they are liberals will support things like gay marriage and maybe give lip service to police brutality while reactionaries will just complain about muh degenerates and that black people are subhumans however being less reactionary than the alt right is a low fucking bat liberals will happily drone you overthrow your leftists government sell arms to oppressive nations support corporate trade deals that fuck over the proles and imprison you for whistleblowing government atrocities my experience with clintonite liberals on reddit is that theyre some of the nastiest smug and patronizing people ive ever seen on the site theyre surprisingly reactionary while obviously trump supporters are openly reactionary
socialism,removed,liberalism by deffinition only has a psuedo left
socialism,removed,there is no big other or conspiracy for people getting screwed in todays economy if youre just blaming capitalism then youre in a state of false consciousness of course theres a conspiracy the rich and powerful will always conspire to keep themselves that way of course theres a big other its the media the corporations those who collectively construct our culture psyche and mindset nazis used with criticizing jewish bankers parasites and leeches a way to draw in the proletariat with criticisms of this parasitic class the bourgeoise without openly saying the bourgeoise i wouldnt be so sure even the frankfurt school who fled the nazis attributed some of the cultural construct of america to easygoing liberalism and jewish intellectuals in our age the objective social tendency is incarnate in the hidden subjective purposes of company directors the foremost among whom are in the most powerful sectors of industry – steel petroleum electricity and chemicals culture monopolies are weak and dependent in comparison they cannot afford to neglect their appeasement of the real holders of power if their sphere of activity in mass society a sphere producing a specific type of commodity which anyhow is still too closely bound up with easygoing liberalism and jewish intellectuals is not to undergo a series of purges the dependence of the most powerful broadcasting company on the electrical industry or of the motion picture industry on the banks is characteristic of the whole sphere whose individual branches are themselves economically interwoven all are in such close contact that the extreme concentration of mental forces allows demarcation lines between different firms and technical branches to be ignored that said im not a radical im an antileninist antistalinist antirevolutionary social democrat i just happen to be a cultural radical who believes that a conservative is just a comrade you havent convinced yet thats the nature of marxism it cant be made apparent until all classes of people understand it isnt a direct threat to them their intellect or their lifestyle in terms of their physical and psychological needs this like universal basic income do not negate the dignity of unalienated labor they in fact increase the dignity of productive labour as being a choice something one would want to do if the task and time and need is right
socialism,removed,meh i wouldnt call it racism just living in a bubblevery isolated one from the reality
socialism,removed,so you think that white people who have any success must have simply benefitted from their skin color and texture to has nothing to do with the decisions in their lifebecause whatits impossible for white people to make good decisions then when a white person simply disagrees with this racist ideologyyou think it must be them who is racist the fact is that no matter what race you areif in the west you bother to educate yourself and work to contribute to your community while avoiding bad decisions such as crime or drug addiction or teen pregnancyyou will very likely do fine its that easy but making good decisions is something that a large number of black people do not do it looks to you that white people have privilege because it just so happens that they tend to make better decisions than black people asians meanwhile tend to make better decisions than white people and therefore they tend to have higher success on average than whites would that be possible in a system rigged for white people
socialism,removed,after all clintons far better than trump better of two evils etc if we dont support clinton who knows we might get trump its sad but the current politics force a polarization either youre for clinton and against trump or for trump and against clinton because theres no way a thirdparty candidate will ever win
socialism,removed,because how else will people know you are a socialist unless you constantly whinge about liberals knowledge of liberal philosophy not required like with this video oliver isnt defending clinton hes saying trump is worse particularly in his scandals which you know he is unless socialists suddenly care more about state department email protocol than racially discriminatory housing
socialism,removed,i know it says no supporting hillary and i know it probably gets me banned but hillary mentioned in the debate that she will arm the kurds in syria me being middle eastern thats all i wanted to hear from any candidate anywhere in the world russia is bombing them assad and iran are killing them they are saudi and isis number one enemy and they are all proud egalitarian socialists if hillary is giving them arms thats enough for me to support her i cant vote btw
socialism,removed,no obligation well of course they have no obligation but as a white cisgendered male myself i have to say that its really hard for me to grasp their struggle and no i dont just accept there is one because im told they have no obligation to explain it to me but when i dont see something its hard to believe that its real what im saying is is that my extreme privilege makes it so a lot of problems for women and poc are invisible to me because racistssexists wont expose themselves in front of me a good example is my so who is female has a disgusting boss who regularly harasses her and discusses sexual acts hed like to do with her to other employees i would have no idea this was happening if she were not my so as its unlikely she would reveal it to me id probably have to meet her boss for it to be clear to me a lot of racism is really easy to find but the easy ones to find can be chalked up as being done by racists who are ok with being racists same goes for sexismtransphobia other isms i think its important to recognize that a lot of these acts are invisible to white allies and so when people i trust tell me their struggles is allows me to sympathize and recognize the amount of these isms are portrayed to emphasize nobody is obliged to explain anything to me but the more these things are documented the easier it is to fix the problem
socialism,removed,interesting point
socialism,removed,im a mod on the other discord and can verify none of this happened i will likely be banned for this comment
socialism,removed,except nobody defended imperialism you took a screenshot of someones comment that was taken out of context and even out of context its a stretch as for racism and sexism i have no idea where you got that from ive not seen anyone say something remotely bigoted without them getting called out for it
socialism,removed,was i blocked from the socialism discord or is the link just not working
socialism,removed,mmmm salty salty tears
socialism,removed,this is pretty fucked up the sad men who write this crap probably didnt get enough hugs and kisses from their mothers
socialism,removed,what does this have to do with socialism
socialism,removed,you have to be an utterly reprehensible cunt for the london met to take antifas side theyre usually quite happy to give antifa a beating and let fascists demonstrate etc shes a libertarian shitstain journalist ie goes to marginalised groups and provokes them to prove why they shouldnt marry have sex be a minority etc i invite people to read her wiki page she gets bottles of piss tipped on her head far too frequently to not be a complete arsehole
socialism,removed,i do every three hours like clockwork
socialism,removed,stop women are not unique in the trolling we receive if some stupid kids writing stupid things are the worst we have to deal with then weve quite thoroughly won our equality furthermore the insinuation that men are categorically and collectively at fault for anything unpleasant that a woman experiences and that therefore individual men cannot be innocent is profoundly evil this thread has nothing to do with socialism as an ideology as an economic or political system nor as a philosophy its strictly and purely gender baiting get it out of here and take your concern trolling and tone police with you
socialism,removed,yea like marching around telling people to stop being racist will do anything
socialism,removed,these anarchist farleft shitbags wearning masks so the cops dont see their faces and hide their possible previous links to thugery and criminality its no wonder stalin called the nutty multicultural mob of far leftwing the useful idiots in the end of the day the farleft and the farright go full circle and become one and the same as much as i might disagree with characters like this canadian lauren southern not this time here she is dead on and she is correct to call out the londonistan anarchy mob for its bs go to dave rubins interview with ayaan hirsi ali to see how the leftwing is now fucking itself up the ass for the sake of politics
socialism,removed,wtf you on about im from the leftwing you dumb shitbag
socialism,removed,thats great but no one pays attention or cares except yourselves youre weak and laughable at best no one takes you seriously except your comrades until you actually accomplish something youre a bunch of children running around in the street
socialism,removed,you can call me whatever you want just dont get hit by a car
socialism,removed,sorry how is physically prohibiting the free expression of unpopular beliefs and opinions even remotely socialist i would understand if you wanted to stage a counter protest but stop them how i vehemently disagree with these people but in no way do i have the right to trample on their free speech counter protest yes stop them no
socialism,removed,they have a right to just like the bernie supporters at the trump rallies
socialism,removed,i know on the plus side well have plenty of new material for rshitliberalssay
socialism,removed,since when are socialists also feminists
socialism,removed,i havent dabbled much in the context of biological difference
socialism,removed,unlike the slavic and greek slaves of the family private property and the state
socialism,removed,i mean the claim is that they should be able to harm people because theyre different
socialism,removed,i see people throw this around but i also have no idea what they mean
socialism,removed,in addition to visual differences there are genetic differences between people of different ethnicities
socialism,removed,clara zetkin as well dont you also get rid of capitalism as well as the horizontal ones
socialism,removed,brocialist is basically a misandryst term radical leftists in the us have been overrun by misandrysts for a long time the current ideology is that leftismsocialismetc is specifically against straight white males and if you happen to be one you cant join the socialism club unless you denounce yourself and join in attacking this group people who react against this toxicity are automatically labeled misogynists and repressive or new favorite codeword for identifying the enemy privileged its toxic politics like this that make socialism a blazing failure in the united states leftists fail at gaining popular support and corporate capitalism just laughs
socialism,removed,not kidding
socialism,removed,the capitalist mode of production is based on colonial ideology and racist pseudoscience
socialism,removed,yes but it seems like the black panthers
socialism,removed,best answer
socialism,removed,neither of those really accurately define the type of people that are mostly referred to as brocialists or brosocialists many would be considered feminists and acknowledge racial issues and inequalities while maintaining that the only effective way to combat these is by first eliminating class and capitalism as a whole and that capitalism is the root cause of sexismracism which it is
socialism,removed,malcolm x publicly supported black separation surely these guys have similar nonracist reasons s
socialism,removed,fair enough they soooort of bring it upon themselves i suppose theyre pretty nasty but universal freedom of speech blah blah left shit right
socialism,removed,pick your favorite quote by one of many famous marxists and socialists who have adamantly advocated for the absolute and universal right to freedom of speech and expression lest authoritarian fascists take over and suppress our rights in turn blah blah pretend i went to the effort of googling a few for you
socialism,removed,throughout my personal experiences this is my understanding
socialism,removed,why blame individuals when you can demonize an entire economic system
socialism,removed,arent unions are a capitalist structure by setting the price of labor they are free to negotiate wages and benefits within the capitalist system more accurate title is murdered by people intending on abusing a lack of information in the labor market something that ideal capitalist models assume isnt the case due to perfect information
socialism,removed,i made my point in my initial response individuals killed him capitalists killed him a system for the allocation of resources did not because it is incapable
socialism,removed,capitalism didnt murder this man capitalism is intangible i think its appalling that this would be a popular post and does not help this community gain traction
socialism,removed,you caught me im a monster hell bent on destroying the socialist movement and everything its stands for we can have a real conversation when you finish raging against the machine
socialism,removed,thanks for the first decent response this has explained a lot although i would not call my self a feminist
socialism,removed,the people who create jobs may not be rich its the people who have the idea knowhow and ambition to start a business to organize the labour and resources to get it to work to supply the consumer needs yes there will be more jobs but cost to produce will cost more resulting in less resources for people note socialism wouldnt have this problem if they dont waste labour organization yes gates got rich off people labour but they had the labour to trade for gates vision and organization of labour and resources which is labour itself shouldnt he get paid for that in gates case unlike walmart example people didnt know the advantage until it was made no consumer base ahead walmart in the other consumers already existed
socialism,removed,and the other half are ugly amiright s
socialism,removed,i spend a lot of time on rdebatefascism and the guys who are an upholder of this ideology are allright i consider them comrades at least
socialism,removed,and the other half are banging of the time it works all the time
socialism,removed,less dead black people sure baltimore already did that experiment and it didnt take long for them to be begging for the cops to come back a month and a half after six officers were charged in mr grays death policing has dwindled in some of baltimores most dangerous neighborhoods and murders have risen to levels not seen in four decades the totals include a man fatally shot on this drug corner last month police union officials say that officers are still coming to work but that some feel a newfound reluctance and are stepping back questioning whether they will be prosecuted for actions they take on the job
socialism,removed,theres a difference between individualism and individuality individualism is the evil sociopathic shit that needs to be abolished

socialism,removed,reform capitalism until it gradually becomes market socialism by generalizing cooperatives and eliminating private ownership why do you want market socialism why do you want markets at all have you ever considered something outside of cozy social democratic capitalism i think a revolution is undesirable there is no need for a revolution if the majority are convinced socialists and vote for a socialist party to implement changes easy for you to say you dont live in a country where us drones bomb where you live and people work or more hours per day in factories or sweatshops for one or two dollars if the people want capitalism then that is the system which we must accept—the majority rule especially when it is the far majority must be respected i dont see any reason why reactionary positions expressed democratically should be respected or adhered to if the majority of the population wants to persecute a group of people are you going to respect that as an example trans people are most often thrown under the bus by the cis population when it comes to equal rights would you respect that being done by a majority vote if not why would you respect capitalism being maintained by a majority vote it is just sad that so many people will suffer unnecessarily in the meantime but i think the past century has shown us that vanguardism to have a selected elite with strong class consciousness to guide the working class is not the way to go why because it wasnt something comfortable and easy like social democracy it was vanguardist revolution that liberated cuba it was vanguardism that liberated vietnam had it not been for revolution under a vanguard party socialism would have been virtually nonexistent throughout history its easy for you or me to denounce revolution when were not being stomped over by imperialism but for the majority of the world its the only hope of a positive future
socialism,removed,only in america does liberal mean what you think it means
socialism,removed,hope you all crash have a nice trip
socialism,removed,sanders is a bourgeois social democraf
socialism,removed,liberals are committed to build and safeguard free fair and open societies in which they seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty equality and community and in which no one is enslaved by poverty ignorance or conformity liberalism aims to disperse power to foster diversity and to nurture creativity liberal international
socialism,removed,yeah thats exactly the type of infighting that will cause outbreaks of chaos among protesters and hurt our cause
socialism,removed,i get where youre coming from because i was there at first too but i think what you have to realize is that liberal means a specific thing and if you consider yourself a socialist youll come to realize that by definition you cant be a liberal it does take some getting used to though i used to consider myself a liberal and im so used to the word liberal being thrown around in a negative sense by conservatives it takes some time to remind yourself that the world isnt liberals versus conservatives tldr if youre here and youre a socialist then relax when people are talking about liberals theyre not talking about you because by definition a socialist cannot be a liberal
socialism,removed,honestly that wouldnt be a bad idea as an american the terminology took a little getting used to
socialism,removed,there is only one party in the united states the property partyand it has two right wings republican and democrat republicans are a bit stupider more rigid more doctrinaire in their laissezfaire capitalism than the democrats who are cuter prettier a bit more corrupt—until recently and more willing than the republicans to make small adjustments when the poor the black the antiimperialists get out of hand but essentially there is no difference between the two parties mdash gore vidal written in the
socialism,removed,i start with a basic assumption that people understand what i say and from there i clarify only if it seems necessary
socialism,removed,the term has really lost its original meaning in the usa people basically use it to say that they are somewhere to the left of the republican party and its supporters that can be anything from the rich dnc democrats to bernie supporters to anarchosyndicalists it really doesnt say much about their actual beliefs and calling yourself socialist in the us is a good way to get the rest of your words ignored because the population has been conditioned to associate socialism with totalitarianism so sometimes its just easier to say im liberal when people ask you
socialism,removed,yeah i have found myself looking up the word liberal every other day recently there are some sources that define the word liberal as a supporter of unrestricted capitalism although i havent found a source that lists that as the primary definition i suspect that years of rightwing propaganda has taken its toll on the word and know there are even some on the left who believe that self identified liberals are the source of all evil
socialism,removed,its weird because of republican people think liberal means socialist
socialism,removed,you all do more for right wing nationalism than any figure head could dream of thank you and keep it up dont forget milk you all will need a lot of it today you actual fascists
socialism,removed,riots are for the weak and doesnt build strength trump is president because of the weakness of his opponents
socialism,removed,lol
socialism,removed,oh poor victims they will be so hurt they should tell president trump to check his privilege
socialism,removed,oh dont worry i know how crаzy left you guys are so much that even someone like bеrnie is too bоurgeois for you but i dont know of anyone in the recent election who this subreddit would champion so i listed those people
socialism,removed,why are you participating in our echo chamber and you guys are different from thedonald how
socialism,removed,y u no kill pigs 😜
socialism,removed,name two times electing a socialist actually worked lmao
socialism,removed,its like listening to my mother he is racist and homophobic i ask her to elaborate and she gives me the look and adds i saw it on tv
socialism,removed,we should all take up arms and start a revolution to overthrow this fascist govt or better yet lets stay in our basements and whine on reddit like little babies
socialism,removed,lol
socialism,removed,and with each riot you guys put on with every american flag you burn and cop car tuned over with every shop window smashed and store looted you bring him that much closer to a win in so for that i thank you

socialism,removed,the fun part is of the people saying they will do anything wont do shit
socialism,removed,you wont do anything stop acting like you will play out one of your revolutionist fantasies irl you will have masturbate cry about trump online for a bit and go to play videogames none of you will do anything apart from circlejerk how its time or organise nothing will happen this is embarrassing
socialism,removed,the past couple of weeks ive seen almost nonstop police hate on rsocialism and rcommunism as a current security officer hoping to one day become a police officer it makes me sad im not blind the injustice but i see posts defending the majority of muslisms and then i see hive mind pitchfork hate against every single cop in existence am sad
socialism,removed,if youre a veteran and against the war youve basically defeated your mind this is also what causes ptsd that claustrophobic feeling that the majorty of the country you fought for is against you there were very good reasons for going to war with sadam in iraq and just because areas of iraq are controlled by isis saudi sponsored terrorists today doesnt mean the moderate shia kurdish liberals arent fighting for their right to a free and democratic society where women can be educated and not have to wear a mask
socialism,removed,ralternativeleft is waiting guys
socialism,removed,mao did something similar i think except he offered them a time line be off opium by x and youll live
socialism,removed,lol a feminist what a dumb cunt
socialism,removed,yeah right im positive i pay more in taxes than your dumb ass
socialism,removed,thats rich he didnt pay his tickets and yet it was racial profiling that caused him to have to pay the fines no self accountability blackness means you should be above the law
socialism,removed,once again humans have failed to achieve full socialism
socialism,removed,great article will have to start going on medium more
socialism,removed,a subreddit that ironically is criticising communism and their slave labor practices good thing trump is attempting to put a stop to this sort of thing
socialism,removed,tfw the socialist country is the one on the bottom
socialism,removed,because the top takes place in a capitalist country while the bottom takes place in a socialist country
socialism,removed,i can taste the salt in this thread through my screen
socialism,removed,ah right i forgot the no true socialist fallacy undeniable truth
socialism,removed,o shit my b i forgot people in socialist countries just starve to death rather than work for other countries with higher gdp
socialism,removed,right after we get our starbucks cappuccinos like for reals this time i swear no really mom
socialism,removed,something needs to be done every socialist ive ever met
socialism,removed,all talk no action gotta love the socialists
socialism,removed,all talk no action thats what socialists do
socialism,removed,rightim sure that the stores will be able to make stuff next year with all the money they lost
socialism,removed,every time i see one of my former high school bullies in a mcdonalds uniform i thank god that america is capitalist and i can make ten times more than those jerks and rub it in their faces
socialism,removed,well the white kid got his so all is well
socialism,removed,at least theyre not child soldiers like african children
socialism,removed,globalism or nationalism your choice socialists
socialism,removed,theres a reason why america moved forward and as a society and developed laws to protect those people its not necessarily a socialistic only viewpoint to protect children who are people incapable of consent
socialism,removed,maybe if you didnt want people from rall calling half the shit on this sub completely stupid nonsense you shouldnt have posted so much completely stupid nonsense
socialism,removed,well a markets got to start from somewhere
socialism,removed,is talk about trumps constant line of serious scandals not discussion now
socialism,removed,some people dont have assholes how could you be so insensitive
socialism,removed,this is textbook propaganda
socialism,removed,between and was the american industrial revolution during the revolution there was child labor exploitation sewing factory fires double dip payment schemes no overtime and countless injuries it took american years to find its way to proper health safety and adequate wage rights these other countries will find their way too
socialism,removed,i want you to go on stage and try doing the aristocrats joke without anyone getting offended when your comedic role is entirely based in being the absolute most extreme you can be then a heckler or two that clearly dont care can send your act careening the only reason anyone cares is because it involved race look up jimmy carrs treatment of hecklers for the version of michael richards rant that works
socialism,removed,america wasnt always what it is now it used to be pretty shitty and when we had enough of being exploited you know what happened we decided we wouldnt be exploited anymore and you know how we did that we did it with blood sweat and courage
socialism,removed,if the third world is so miserable they should do something about it
socialism,removed,how much for one of those kids
socialism,removed,then they are weak and refuse to change
socialism,removed,children those are adult vegetarians
socialism,removed,then make your sub not show up on rall
socialism,removed,at least they have jobs
socialism,removed,so the end message here is to abolish christmas and make everyone work regardless of age or upbringing
socialism,removed,i just dont want to have to guide you through the mud for easy virtue signaling
socialism,removed,wheres their toilet paper tho
socialism,removed,what is the economic system called when the state owns all corporations in trust for the people
socialism,removed,i understand this is rsocialism but i think people dont realize that this sort of situation keeps these kids from starving or being sold into sex slavery also theyre usually not kids actual child labor is pretty rare factory jobs in developing countries are highly competitive because theyre good safe money as opposed to say agriculture jobs i guess my point is how does socialism help these people in their countries when the countries themselves dont have the economic resources to provide for their people in general a good example is india who have a massive population with a very low per capita in this example i cant really see socialism being useful as opposed to more developed countries where if the per capita were spread out the average person would be able to meet the cost of living overall i think this post is oversimplifying a complex situation
socialism,removed,wait a minute this isnt rpoorfags what am i looking at here
socialism,removed,i dont think you understand the button meme both buttons need to be ubpushable for patriot man you merely placed two contradictory statements side by side
socialism,removed,venezuela
socialism,removed,i lold a lil
socialism,removed,forgive me for linking to npr but i think hard work should be rewarded not redistributed
socialism,removed,there was a time when minimum wage was just for teens medicaid provides a lot of protection for the poor the majority of people are safe in this country no matter their color
socialism,removed,what was the ableist slur i just read the comment on ceddit and cant seem to find anything wrong with it
socialism,removed,i dont care i dont want people to be harmed or discriminated against officially or otherwise because theyre trans or for any other reason but beyond that im meh trans people dont hurt anyone and they shouldnt be fucked with but if a transperson is a class enemy theyre no comrade of mine preventing prejudice is important but its a separate issue from class struggle and politicaleconomic revolution imo the heavy emphasis the american liberal centreleft has been placing on identity politics is yet another way people are being distracted from their class interests and divided along other lines
socialism,removed,you cant honestly think it doesnt go much farther than that particularly in the media
socialism,removed,awww people still think equality exists if it benefits the women how sweet
socialism,removed,and i wanted to add that his gem is really awesome all entrepeneurs are borgeois by definition but no its not true the guy autoentrepeneur means a man business if you are working for yourself then youre exploiting others and do apply for that definition its saying this craftspersonartisan who makes shoestoolswoodworking on his own is a filthy bourgeois the guy works with his hands and is his own boss and so saying hes more bourgeois than proletariat is complete insanity here i finished my ranting sorry i really feel disconnected with the socialist movement because of idiots like this one
socialism,removed,only when women take full responsibility when it comes to laying the groundwork of civilization including the dangerous and disgusting jobs no one wants to do only then can they join men and together build a new world
socialism,removed,because men spend time bringing home the food maybe shared responsibilities anyone
socialism,removed,lol sjw fucking bullshit look youre all national socialist im putting up the definition and youre arguing with wikipedia idiot fucking nazi piece of shit you are and artisan is not bourgeois you fuckwad i own my own shop i am my own boss aka autoentrepreneur is socialism at its best and not fucking bourgeoisie now please read this flow of insults youre a niggerfaggot kill yourself youre so stupid its god damn retardation with at least a couple extra chromosomes and yeah im ready to go through with trangressing every fucking sjw rules you got here now please understand that youre far away from your little safe space that me raping your little anus is on the list of things you can expect is that enough have i fucked theese neonazi social justice rules enough you are such facist cunts it hurts to see you argue on stuff like this
socialism,removed,so pretty much copying the ideas of the old revolutionaries that have no bearing in todays circumstances if you tried some bs like that today you would promptly be labeled a terrorist and crushed accordingly
socialism,removed,gulags are community effort not many people recognize this
socialism,removed,this is absolutely sexist
socialism,removed,you know most couples decide together how to split work and many decide that men should focus more on their career because they have the higher salary and it benefits the family more
socialism,removed,its not saying that it singles out men
socialism,removed,okay im not talking about statistics and im not denying anything im stating the fact that this is completely sexist it literally states men and boys nowhere on this paper is an all inclusive word or phrase like everyone used
socialism,removed,ok and women can start doing their fair share of the yard work changing their own car oil washing their own cars fixing their own trinkets that they break fixing the sinks when the start to leak replacing their own garbage disposals when they break and they can do their share of regrouting the bathtub when it gets old i dont see the issue with mens and womens jobs around the house if women want men to start doing their fair share of their chores then they can start doing the ones ive listed above
socialism,removed,not saying they are stupid but generally men are better with cars tools etc why is this frowned upon
socialism,removed,war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength
socialism,removed,if you told most women it was their turn to change the oil in the car they would laugh
socialism,removed,yeah but the guys usually end up doing the yard work physical mechanical maintenance and repair working on cars etc
socialism,removed,men are not currently doing their part at home you are a sexist
socialism,removed,men tend to work more than women when both paid and unpaid work is added together how much more should men work compared to women to satisfy the ideological narrative
socialism,removed,lol just as soon as princess splits the yard work and bills divorce that bitch
socialism,removed,i have no problems with this so i guess princess will split the yard work house repair auto maintenance and bills in return
socialism,removed,people simply disappeared always during the night your name was removed from the registers every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out and your onetime existence was denied and then forgotten you were abolished annihilated vaporized was the usual word
socialism,removed,a handsome toughlooking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol while his small sister about two years younger made the same gesture with a fragment of wood both of them were dressed in the blue shorts grey shirts and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the spies winston raised his hands above his head but with an uneasy feeling so vicious was the boys demeanor that it was not altogether a game youre a traitor yelled the boy youre a thoughtcriminal youre a eurasian spy ill shoot you ill vaporize you ill send you to the salt mines suddenly they were both leaping round him shouting traitor and thoughtcriminal the little girl imitating her brother in every movement it was somehow slightly frightening like the gamboling of tiger cubs which will soon grow up into maneaters there was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boys eye a quite evident desire to hit or kick winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so
socialism,removed,the party seeks power entirely for its own sake we are not interested in the good of others we are interested solely in power not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness only power pure power what pure power means you will understand presently we are different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing all the others even those who resembled ourselves were cowards and hypocrites the german nazis and the russian communists came very close to us in their methods but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives they pretended perhaps they even believed that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal we are not like that we know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it power is not a means it is an end one does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship the object of persecution is persecution the object of torture is torture the object of power is power now do you begin to understand me
socialism,removed,do you begin to see then what kind of world we are creating it is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias that the old reformers imagined a world of fear and treachery is torment a world of trampling and being trampled upon a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself progress in our world will be progress towards more pain the old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice ours is founded upon hatred in our world there will be no emotions except fear rage triumph and selfabasement everything else we shall destroy everything already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the revolution we have cut the links between child and parent and between man and man and between man and woman no one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer but in the future there will be no wives and no friends children will be taken from their mothers at birth as one takes eggs from a hen the sex instinct will be eradicated procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card we shall abolish the orgasm our neurologists are mat work upon it now there will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party there will be no love except the love of big brother
socialism,removed,its not a matter of how socialist you are as it is just a method of stopping the subreddit from spiraling into liberalism sounds like your ideology has trouble competing on the market of ideas
socialism,removed,arguably theres significant difference between shiposting the same shit times and spam and having a subreddit spiral into liberalism i find it rather telling how weak the ideology is that the moderation team has to keep such an iron grasp on the narrative and conversation here if socialism is so much better it should inherently out compete the liberal responses and the only moderation should really be to weed out actual spam and loweffort posting
socialism,removed,but always – do not forget this winston – always there will be the intoxication of power constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler always at every moment there will be the thrill of victory the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless if you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human face – for ever
socialism,removed,i wonder why that is
socialism,removed,isnt this the dream of the modern woman what you have always wanted isnt this what you fought so hard for why are you complaining now when this is exactly what you appear to have lobbied for several decades for
socialism,removed,what about women taking their responsibility for the house maintenance yardwork and auto repair i get this poster advocates everyone doing their fair share of the chores but putting the focus on men comes off as kind of sexist
socialism,removed,how can you actually suggest that being a good mother and being a good housewife is worthless the fucking balls on you people as if motherhood is worthless oh you meant in the capitalistic sense i dont give a shit you people wonder why women feel so hopeless and at the same time say shit like that motherhood should be fucking honored if more mothers actually gave a shit to be good mothers our children would grow up to be happy adults and be more productive and less mentally ill and fucked in the head instead you modern women appear to expect every single thing in the world for yourselves and in the end you get nothing this is reflected in the statistics of selfreported happiness which reveals that women are more miserable now than they have ever been in all of modernity i dont feel bad though you brought this upon yourselves
socialism,removed,this is the most dumbass forced marxist shit ever women dont even know how to cook anymore
socialism,removed,in principle membership of these three groups is not hereditary the child of inner party parents is in theory not born into the inner party admission to either branch of the party is by examination taken at the age of sixteen nor is there any racial discrimination or any marked domination of one province by another jews negroes south americans of pure indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the party its rulers are not held together by bloodties but by adherence to a common doctrine the party is not a class in the old sense of the word it does not aim at transmitting power to its own children as such and if there were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat in the crucial years the fact that the party was not a hereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition the essence of oligarchic rule is not fathertoson inheritance but the persistence of a certain worldview and a certain way of life imposed by the dead upon the living a ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its successors the party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with perpetuating itself
socialism,removed,gulags are community effort not many people recognize this edit seems my comment vanished strange
socialism,removed,i really hope you didnt get the message that we shouldnt be fighting against those kinds of problems from my post if you did please reread focusing on sentences like those can be very important issues and shouldnt be ignored by anybody certainly not socialists theyre just not the issues that are the most strategically beneficial to focus on rhetorically and theyre issues that get a lot easier to solve the more progress we make on the anticapitalist front
socialism,removed,get used to it its the only job you idiots are likely to get
socialism,removed,fuck you lazy ass communist cunts
socialism,removed,thanks to capitalism i have a dishwasher my dishes are being washed as i drink beer and laugh at you idiots
socialism,removed,you cucks are hilariously pathetic wash dishes as a political statement hurr durr take me seriously
socialism,removed,tell that to my wife who cant fucking figure out how to clean as you go i cook a meal and when were done with dinner only dishes are the ones we ate off of when she cooks i swear the kitchen is a warzone
socialism,removed,please live up to wakas verse and the sake of my username comrades let these jackasses know they arent welcome
socialism,removed,im fully aware gentrification is probably the one area where i disagree with this sub i would love to do whatever possible to eliminate poverty and i am a huge proponent of ubi but gentrification is inevitable is it kind of a shame that people get quasiforced out of a neighborhood theyve been inhabiting for perhaps decades sure in a way do i feel bad that these working class andor poor families are seeing windfall profits from these properties hell no good for them id move miles away too if someone gave me for a house that was longsince paid off
socialism,removed,is it lower by how much
socialism,removed,yeah white people should never move into a neighborhood of nonwhites thats called gentrification but once theyre there they should never leave thats called white flight gentrification is bad white flight is bad just to be safe from criticism white people should never move into or out of nonwhite neighborhoods everyone should just stay with their own kind at least thats the only solution within the logic of these criticisms yay socialist segregation
socialism,removed,by making arabs a protected minority which it has
socialism,removed,by that logic we can assume that government in general is racist theres not a country on this planet without racist cops dont be silly
socialism,removed,you cant find a way to volunteer either
socialism,removed,then they arent effected phd holders just like anyone else should at least give back to the society which is supporting them by doing volunteer work
socialism,removed,not communists and socialists who want to murder political opponents though they should be able to speaks
socialism,removed,miles km miles km post feedback in rtometric
socialism,removed,miles km post feedback in rtometric
socialism,removed,most sports are patriarchal and misogynistic so we shouldnt support them there are more important concerns than sports
socialism,removed,gregory maximoff the guillotine at work the leninist counter revolution
socialism,removed,what they dont mention is that those children are hamas soldiers
socialism,removed,so you want to combat inflation and not develop areas that sounds like a terrible idea
socialism,removed,i can tell you that when my poor or homeless clients call to report that they have been a victim of crime the police couldnt care less that is an awfully broad brush you paint an entire profession with i would hope you treat them with the same open mindedness that you expect out of them even if you dont think they deserve it but viewing them as humans that are doing their best under their own difficult circumstances is much more difficult than making sweeping generalizations isnt it perhaps you have more in common with these cops than you are willing to acknowledge
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,lol fucking liberals
socialism,removed,🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺 do do do doooooooo
socialism,removed,i thought police enforced the law
socialism,removed,i think your reasoning is a little skewed youre talking about people that use the system multiple times a day for issues like the flu or finding a warm place to sleep not that there is anything wrong with that our first responders will gladly help out the disenfranchised however night after night it becomes an issue if they are truly the victim of a crime the police will do what they can to help them you have to understand that the volume of calls that come from places like shelters low income housing etc can wear any persons patience thin more so when the individuals they encounter tell halftruths or their sobriety is in question
socialism,removed,weird how crime is motivated by taking other peoples property dumbasses
socialism,removed,so why single out israel
socialism,removed,thats a lie being in a violent riot is enough to be arrested but the pa and hamas and pretty much all palestinian groups call those protests
socialism,removed,hundreds out of the beta israel in israel who havent refused military service the horrible treatment of palestinians like giving arab israelis equal access to public services and voting not forcing them into military service to make sure they dont have to fight against family members making a law saying all signs that arabs will see have to be in arabic granting visas for ramadan to allow palestinians to visit israeli family members allowing the third biggest party joint list an arab party in israel to exist even though its against the state of israel not allowing jews to pray on the temple mount so as not to offend arabs and providing open prayer anywhere in israel including the western wall to arabs not to mention the high rate of arab doctors and arab technology students in israel or the high rate of arab idf generals or the arab judge who sent an israeli pm and a president to jail
socialism,removed,im not a liberal maybe thats why i dont agree with you
socialism,removed,sure there are bad cops out there but the majority of them are very good people and serve and protect our communities and cities i have much respect for police as many others should as well
socialism,removed,you realize that if youre working with poor or homeless clients youre only hearing their side of the story right you think if the police knew that a crime was committed and had a lead that they wouldnt pursue you should always research both sides before you make a claim like this
socialism,removed,so how should police in a socialist society ideally police what would be their role and function and how would it differ from capitalist policing
socialism,removed,typical socialist
socialism,removed,tpp a capitalists wet dream trade deal the public hasnt even gotten a chance to read obamacare a flopped socialistic health system which ended up being a shitty malformed piece of statecapitalism nsa where to even begin yeah anyone who unironically calls obama a marxist is a fountain of stupid

socialism,removed,quick question for people here whats your opinion about the fact that kaepernick didnt vote i half supported him didnt think he was the antichrist for kneeling but i found the fact that hes only really been complaining and not trying to take action kinda changed my view
socialism,removed,maybe he should have voted in this election where the death penalty and marijuana legalization were on the ballot both are big criminal justice issues that he cares about
socialism,removed,seems like it is i dont see how its not
socialism,removed,was asking a question to understand other peoples opinions
socialism,removed,seems like youre part of the problem then
socialism,removed,you also vote on a whole slew of other issues marijuana didnt get legalized in calimaine because people thought their one vote didnt matter it got legalized only because people did vote usheriffrage replying to you in this comment cause it only lets me post once every minutes well there were no socialist candidates most of us find liberals like clinton just as repugnant as neocons and fascists see rshitliberalssay voting is not taking action i hated the two main candidates too and disliked the two runner ups but theres more voting than just the election you decide propsreps as well both very important to the direction the country is headed in see above
socialism,removed,just an example of voting making a change he can easily do both right now all hes really done two main things brought more national attention toward racial injustice good but did it in a way that made the majority of people dislike him and take the issues less seriously bad i wholeheartedly believe that racism is prevalent in the us today i dont think that merely kneeling for an anthem will bring about positive change
socialism,removed,fag the alt right won this election
socialism,removed,our message is that we want to defend ordinary white people and their traditional way of life the lefts message is that all white people are privileged and probably racist too and they need to join a revolution that will destroy everything theyve ever known is it any surprise who they feel more sympathetic towards
socialism,removed,hahahaha wow dude what kind of a pussy are you
socialism,removed,titlecansure us toomors
socialism,removed,heavily armed communists patrolling streets in texas how is this allowed they need to be stoppedkillemall usa maga infowars ￼ hahahahaha no fuck off fash cunt
socialism,removed,why is wlm racist and blm is not
socialism,removed,they dont have to the left already does this
socialism,removed,go ahead the bill of rights applies to everyone including racists communists and sane people
socialism,removed,is gun control for socialists not a talking point anymore is this a case of the ends justifies the means exciting time when you leftists become fans of the second amendment
socialism,removed,didnt downvote you but okay
socialism,removed,more winning less losing understand
socialism,removed,white people have nothing to be afraid of white people are in charge white people are the oppressors why are you a socialist then using this logic only people of color are oppressed which goes against fundamental marxist beliefs not to mention to imply that white people as a whole oppress black people as a whole is complete nonsense the problem with white lives matter is that it implies white people are being oppressed in the same context as blacks because of their race instead of other issues which is false for someone talking about about misinformed liberals you sound awfully like a misinformed liberal who doesnt understand socialism or marxist analysis
socialism,removed,lol i will use guns and protests in favor of an ideology that outlaws guns and protest
socialism,removed,lmao please make this happen this sub made my day
socialism,removed,hahahahaha my sides
socialism,removed,the right that advocates for smaller government somehow trusts the government ok
socialism,removed,im not going to lie this is quite honestly the biggest load of bullshit you recognize that historically gun control was about weakening your political opponents and then you ascribe it to your political opponents while they are actively advocating for your right to have a gun
socialism,removed,its cute to watch socialists talk trash about their nazi bros both your ideologies killed a lot of innocent people and still do stop pretending your any better the nazis
socialism,removed,thats not called trolling that is a direct threat backed with weapons the police should act against these terrorists
socialism,removed,oh wow so spooky but most right wing know how dangerous commies really are so you arent impressing anyone just look at the wild and terrifying history of socialist regimes to understand that the flirt most liberals have with socialism is destroying society
socialism,removed,come on its current year bbbbbbbbut
socialism,removed,no we will start shooting back
socialism,removed,because a gun is an automated killing device if you were a real man youd not be a pussy
socialism,removed,can you tell me what the value of life is from where does this value come how is it measured im not bothered by being called pathetic why waste time with insults i am just explaining how i feel in addition i do not think history will repeat itself so long as the internet remains largely unmanipulated and uncensored i would hope that if such terrible things were coming about that people who care as much as you would fight it and i think that would be terrible i think most of you would die so i am hoping that you all chill out and nobody dies unless they are ready to i am hoping that you all talk and come to terms because that would be better but i think that the disenfranchised and the oppressed will fail to win over a lot of the population because you are too angry to be friendly and so you will probably suffer and die and in time it will turn around the cycle will repeat again again again and even if you win the system will break because humans are weak in that way and the cycle will repeat again again again help me understand
socialism,removed,tito was a fuck up and killed lot of innocent civilians including some of my family members
socialism,removed,under hitler and the nazis germany went from being dirt poor to becoming one of the leading powers of europe in a short time span unless your a jew why should the nazis be considered evil
socialism,removed,i personally feel that niggers are subhuman and deserve to be gassed how would you counter me
socialism,removed,comrade stalin approved
socialism,removed,trump won get over it
socialism,removed,why arent the cops shooting these degenerates
socialism,removed,fuck socialism
socialism,removed,well he might of been racist but the main thing is hes a dumb ass who ideas were disproved some odd years ago
socialism,removed,shes a cutie
socialism,removed,if you watch more of her videos youll see that beneath her satire of feminazis there is a more realistic feminism in her
socialism,removed,honestly thats pretty stupid
socialism,removed,i like the hypothetical scenario it proves that nothing in reality fits their narrative
socialism,removed,what if you agree with the abortion part but dont care who people fuck and marry oh thats right this is fucking stupid
socialism,removed,this is rsocialism where we lump every single trump voter people into just two generalizations telling people to go fuck themselves is not how you bring a nation together
socialism,removed,this is so fucking stupid
socialism,removed,ah yes this leftist tolerance ive heard so much about
socialism,removed,the irony of this is pretty fucking stark given the point of the thread being about reaching out to people with misguided views
socialism,removed,they arent going to vote for a better candidate next time trumps voter share roughly represents the ceiling for gop support while clintons voter share roughly represents the floor for democratic support i have spent countless hours talking to moderate and more extreme trump voters these people are committed reactionaries and trying to convert them is not only a waste of time its likely to make them even more reactionary through the backfire effect remember its not just the real extremists who buy into the idea of a liberal media and academy obviously there are no hard figures but i would say a majority of gop voters and elected officials use as their first tactic when confronted with evidence contradictory to their ideology to vaguely assert the source is biased with no specifics likewise when they are called out for bigotry its not just the real extremists who deny and complain about how our culture is too sensitive its damn near close to every gop person ive ever talked to both michelles and jons are a lost cause and asking socialists to appeal to people who are either direct bigots or find bigotry acceptable for other reasons is playing right into the hands of reactionaries the more we try to appeal to them the further rightward we will drift until antiidpol brocialists are a dominant faction the people we need to appeal to are those who didnt vote for anyone this year trump only got roughly of people in the us to vote for him and he didnt even win the popular vote i will not countenance compromise with people who support neofascism for any reason but particularly when there is no reason to believe they are necessary for leftists to gain power at least with socialists who voted for hillary they were doing so on a harmminimization basis given that the revolution wasnt going to occur before the election and trump is a racist sexist antidemocratic demagogue people who voted for trump are in my eyes as irredeemable as those who voted for hitlerand it doesnt matter what their reasons were
socialism,removed,i better go get my helicopter
socialism,removed,i hope not
socialism,removed,at least it actually tries to talk about the issues rather than just insult lol sure
socialism,removed,hahahahahahahahhahah you guys used a cuss word brilliant you guys are great so how can i be smart like you guys what blog do i need to tell people i read
socialism,removed,lol grow up everybody knows socialism doesnt work
socialism,removed,he doesnt like gays but keeps it to himself lets kill him typical lib
socialism,removed,how can you state that you would never ever get an abortion and be okay with others getting them i mean the only reason anyone is against it is because they believe in personhood at conception if you believe that and are pro choice you are pretty obviously supporting what youve already stated is murder
socialism,removed,but its about choice solely with regard to abortion
socialism,removed,its not about reproductive rights as a whole ive never seen it used referring to anything except the legality of abortion
socialism,removed,michelle can go talk to aaliyah and tell her why she voted for someone that might not allow her or her family to enter the country in a couple of months she can also tell her that things are going to be ok while the new president is filling highpower positions with white supremacists michelle can go talk with jane and tell her why she voted for someone who might pass a law that allows her to be fired for being gay michelle can talk to laura who is also a working class person from a rural area that was ignored or affected by neo liberal policies and try to understand how she didnt choose an extremely bigoted dirtbag that represents all the systems failings and who got rich by exploiting the working class michelle can also have a chat with david who is also from a rural area he is also deeply religious but chooses to interpret the bibles main message as love everyone not use these rules to oppress all the different people michelle has a lot of people who she can talk with but she chooses not to she chooses to live in her bubble of thinly veiled bigotry while acting nice to all the people around her thus feeding herself the idea that shes a good person and doesnt need to analyze her core beliefsshe couldve abstained voted or do anything but vote for that asshole you can go talk to her and watch as her eyes glaze over at the first mention of another groups issues and how these problems are related to their very being not just financial i know this is a thick brush to use but its extremely disconcerting the fact that even in the more radical subs people are trying to normalize the election and the people who voted for that shit also the whole all working class people are actually decent but misinformed is really condescending borderline classist the ability to make a moral choice is not directly proportional to your income it also assumes that only white people represent the working classthis was not just between two fiscal policies but also between an attack on the liberties of numerous groups and somebody who at worse mightve left them untouched they chose to shove some people of the crowded boat and theyre asking for clemency because the ration would have been smaller otherwise another thing i know this sub is mostly about a different economic and political system but in this context can we please stop prioritizing the white mans financial plights over whats to come for everyone else and just accept that a lot of people are actually shit from a moral perspective regardless of their class imhothe convincing should be towards those that were on the fence because the time investment would actually be worthwhile you might get results with trump supporters too but only after years so it would be more efficient to just inoculate the others maybe im completely wrong i hope i am actually but this result left me too bitter to actually defend anyone who contributed to it
socialism,removed,what a freaking pathology
socialism,removed,probably shouldnt have mentioned it in the original pos then by the way bourgeois does not mean philosophy i dont agree with
socialism,removed,its not ok to dismiss any kind of ethics debate as bourgeois especially since there is a fair contingent of prolife secular humanists
socialism,removed,hello sjws
socialism,removed,i have to say the titular sentiment seems to be somewhat at odds with the content the only clear difference between jon an michelle is why they hold such unpleasant views it appears that michelle is allowed to support trump because she is working class while jon is an abomination for it because he was born rich jon didnt get rich by exploiting the working class he got rich by being born into it his views on abortion and homosexuality are clearly of a religious rather than class nature and yet jon is the bad guy not the class system itself but an individual who is shaped by it or is that the point
socialism,removed,yawnevery race is racist not just whites
socialism,removed,yawnevery race is racist not just whites

socialism,removed,yes of course because everything is up for debate thats how grown ups in the real world handle situations where rights of people overlap if you believe in a fetus right to life then of course you have to debate when that right trumps the right of the mothers bodily autonomy
socialism,removed,so many gay liberals on my facebook my gulags are going to be fabulous
socialism,removed,these idiots arent even clever its all just the state sucks whats next slavery no wonder literally no one knows what the fuck anarchocapitalism is not worth the fucking time
socialism,removed,the stupidest antisocialist thing ive heard is socialism doesnt work
socialism,removed,you can straight up torture people without trial and put up a sign saying its for the homelands security and people will support it its happened and its happening i know its a lot to ask but if we started to see the homeland in the logical way the fucking entire earth then im sure much of the problems we see today wouldnt exist but people wanting to protect and be protected by their homeland is what makes this
socialism,removed,because they cannot imagine that capitalist economics is anything but a science on the same foundational level of mathematics itself better leave this finish out it breaks the suspension of disbelief and ruins the whole performance never assume that your audience is stupider than you

socialism,removed,as a trump voter i know im way out of my element here i would like to just ask a simple question meant simply for information and not for any type of arguement everyone including those that voted for trump know that he can be very brash do you think that all of these resist trump and fuck trump and trumps an enter derogatory statement here will cause him to start making policies that will specifically harm everyone against him i mean dont you think it would be a good option to rally around your governors and the other political advisors that are in the white house to help convince trump or persuade him to move forward on a policy to your liking or at least to something of a compromise for everyone we all know that presidents tend to change their views on things once entering the white house like obama changed his mind on withdrawing most of us troops from afghanistan couldnt the pushing of others to help persuade trumps opinion and stance on something be a legitimately better option than just marching like i said i know he is a brash man but its years till the next election so getting started now to try and create opportunity with the man on certain issues wouldnt that be a more worthwhile step than simply complaining and marching the country is even more divided now and people dont want to change political sides let alone change governments due to the fact that people see this rioting and marching and they can only think to themselves that they are better than that and dont want to be part of it i want to know what you all think would this help mend the american people back together and be easier to help express the socialist view on more people or do you all think that marching will be a better way to convey your message
socialism,removed,hahaha how is a resist sign symbolize socialism socialism is exactly the opposite of resisting everyone has to conform to the exact same way of life lol you guys crack me up ohhyeah and merica
socialism,removed,gmos are a good thing so is labeling them let the free market be free many companies have tested the waters by labeling their products proudly gmo and i havent heard anything about it hurting their sales
socialism,removed,youre resisting fascism by being fascists brilliant
socialism,removed,without capitalism there wouldnt be a crane to hang a sign from checkmark atheists
socialism,removed,this is another reason why no one takes you serious yeah socialism is great for some countries though it will never ever work in the us
socialism,removed,does it matter you can find hypocrisy amongst most influential figures in history i disagree with capitalism i still invest money in shares though and would not be opposed to owning a business or renting out property

socialism,removed,youre very naive and misanthropic do you think people ever change their minds at all granted you may not have but have a think about it
socialism,removed,and by not debating a facist what message does that send who else is a valid target the communists killed far more than the nazisshould we debate them or is it too dangerous communists appeal to emotion too after all no you lot piss me off youve forced me to defend a bloody facist

socialism,removed,the bourgeoisie by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production by the immensely facilitated means of communication draws all even the most barbarian nations into civilisation the cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all chinese walls with which it forces the barbarians intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate it compels all nations on pain of extinction to adopt the bourgeois mode of production it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst ie to become bourgeois themselves in one word it creates a world after its own image the bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns it has created enormous cities has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life just as it has made the country dependent on the towns so it has made barbarian and semibarbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois the east on the west the bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population of the means of production and of property it has agglomerated population centralised the means of production and has concentrated property in a few hands the necessary consequence of this was political centralisation independent or but loosely connected provinces with separate interests laws governments and systems of taxation became lumped together into one nation with one government one code of laws one national classinterest one frontier and one customstariff the bourgeoisie during its rule of scarce one hundred years has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together subjection of natures forces to man machinery application of chemistry to industry and agriculture steamnavigation railways electric telegraphs clearing of whole continents for cultivation canalisation of rivers whole populations conjured out of the ground — what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour we see then the means of production and of exchange on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up were generated in feudal society at a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry in one word the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces they became so many fetters they had to be burst asunder they were burst asunder into their place stepped free competition accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class a similar movement is going on before our own eyes modern bourgeois society with its relations of production of exchange and of property a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells for many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeois and of its rule it is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial each time more threateningly in these crises a great part not only of the existing products but also of the previously created productive forces are periodically destroyed in these crises there breaks out an epidemic that in all earlier epochs would have seemed an absurdity — the epidemic of overproduction society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism it appears as if a famine a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence industry and commerce seem to be destroyed and why because there is too much civilisation too much means of subsistence too much industry too much commerce the productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property on the contrary they have become too powerful for these conditions by which they are fettered and so soon as they overcome these fetters they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society endanger the existence of bourgeois property the conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them and how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises on the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces on the other by the conquest of new markets and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones that is to say by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented the weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself but not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons — the modern working class — the proletarians in proportion as the bourgeoisie ie capital is developed in the same proportion is the proletariat the modern working class developed — a class of labourers who live only so long as they find work and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital these labourers who must sell themselves piecemeal are a commodity like every other article of commerce and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition to all the fluctuations of the market owing to the extensive use of machinery and to the division of labour the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character and consequently all charm for the workman he becomes an appendage of the machine and it is only the most simple most monotonous and most easily acquired knack that is required of him hence the cost of production of a workman is restricted almost entirely to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance and for the propagation of his race but the price of a commodity and therefore also of labour is equal to its cost of production in proportion therefore as the repulsiveness of the work increases the wage decreases nay more in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases whether by prolongation of the working hours by the increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of machinery etc modern industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist masses of labourers crowded into the factory are organised like soldiers as privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class and of the bourgeois state they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine by the overlooker and above all by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself the more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim the more petty the more hateful and the more embittering it is the less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour in other words the more modern industry becomes developed the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class all are instruments of labour more or less expensive to use according to their age and sex no sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer so far at an end that he receives his wages in cash than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie the landlord the shopkeeper the pawnbroker etc the lower strata of the middle class — the small tradespeople shopkeepers and retired tradesmen generally the handicraftsmen and peasants — all these sink gradually into the proletariat partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which modern industry is carried on and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists partly because their specialised skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population the proletariat goes through various stages of development with its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie at first the contest is carried on by individual labourers then by the workpeople of a factory then by the operative of one trade in one locality against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them they direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production but against the instruments of production themselves they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour they smash to pieces machinery they set factories ablaze they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the middle ages
socialism,removed,i have nothing against the rationale of the picture it is on point but only up until the very end trump got elected because the other candidate had to literaly steal the primary by buying all the support from the midia and from her party i could easily see all of this and then see him complaining about bernie being elected it is all true racism ignorance manipulation fear worsening social condition plain stupidity all played a role in the result but dont pretend for a second you could actualy predict a trump win years ago if you bothered to put any candidate other than the absolutely most hated one by everyone who isnt a democrat besides she won the popular vote anyway just like bernie would have won with an even bigger margin if this wasnt the us we were talking about with a retarded election system and with possibly the worst candidates ever we would all be laughing at how trump got smashed with only of the vote or something
socialism,removed,you people are so fucking delusional holy shit
socialism,removed,are you white if so you are
socialism,removed,its not socialism is a terrible idea were all just here for the memes
socialism,removed,tldr i am unskilled labourer
socialism,removed,yeah but she wasnt much good with a rubiks cube
socialism,removed,what if races are inherently different than one another and they perform differently than one another
socialism,removed,and they would have a point you dont judge stephen hawking for his football skills though his dribbling is on point that being said theoretical physics is essentially philosophy backed by observable science to a degree so is economics especially when one is making a moral argument on the back of it
socialism,removed,ask russia how well that worked out for them tons of food for everyone s
socialism,removed,you dont expect someone here to actually think about what he said do you i mean all that is going on in their head is eistein socialism errmehgerd im right to believe in a failed ideology anywaygood analysis hes so wrong that i found it humorous that anyone would post it here of all places
socialism,removed,good luck in the stone age
socialism,removed,this i drivel read some milton friedman
socialism,removed,ill start should be a discussion of the state dependence of ut carrier and the absurd contortions capitalism goes through to preserve itself
socialism,removed,maybe he should just stick to physics
socialism,removed,yet everyone time full socialism is tried it ends rather terribly for the people at large and not for the politicians government it almost seems like humans will fuck up any and everything irregardless of its benefits
socialism,removed,its funny how capitalism is the vehicle that enables groups to advocate socialism i wonder how somebody could raise the capital in a socialist society to advocate for capitalism theyd need to appeal to a large group of people to collect numerous small contributions which the resulting compilation of wealth would seem to violate socialist tenets then theyd need to lobby the government controlled media if we lived in a socialist society that would be the end of the organized advocating of any alternate system youre welcome socialists
socialism,removed,educational system oriented toward socialist goals you mean brainwashing
socialism,removed,are you a projectile cuz if so imma fling you over straight into the intensifies
socialism,removed,its working great for places like venezuela and vietnam just got back from a month in nam after that i truly believe anyone who thinks socialism is a positive thing for society simply doesnt understand reality im grateful for the perspective gained in my travels in south east asia
socialism,removed,and how did that work out for you bunch of unproductive collectives run under brutal dicturial rule fuck of die and come back educated ands yeah the anachos ever sovled any of the worlds problem they didnt cause ten folds of with their retardedness
socialism,removed,it wont be described as someone on the right no he would be described as someone make sure to keep your sister away from
socialism,removed,stick to physics people are not created equal and even if they were they dont live equally you went to school i went to school you got the nobel prize wheres mine the usa is far from a capitalist country anyway we have socialism throughout
socialism,removed,because socialism always turns to conquest
socialism,removed,man einstein is right look what socialism did for the russians or the koreans their still respectable countries today
socialism,removed,good anyone catch any of the shows im interested in the dialogue if it was nationalistic or fascistic
socialism,removed,only million starved this year work them harder mao zedong
socialism,removed,what name norway is more socialist than china thats for sure and the nazis were socialist they just werent marxist or left wing socialists they certainly advocated for socialism for white germans
socialism,removed,i want surplus resources to return to society no private property libertarian yup just another fucking idiot
socialism,removed,says a lot about you that your reactions are so severe beat him to a fucking pulp sounds like you have a few issues
socialism,removed,any reason why most of this sub is against drug testing welfare receivers i typically agree with most of this sub but realistically it should go to those using it to feed their families not a drug addiction although drug rehabilitation is completely fucked in america anyways so not like theres very many options
socialism,removed,i push them down and spit in their hair
socialism,removed,the bernie voter types go in the right door to collect what is paid for by the left one correct
socialism,removed,welfare incentives single motherhood if you cant afford to breed then do not
socialism,removed,we believe wealth inequality is a serious issue based on the picture and comments what you are talking about is the sin of envy your high bar is a low bar poverty
socialism,removed,ever read the story of how an envious people destroyed the water well of another person simply because that person had a well and they did not your ideology is emotional destructive and defeating
socialism,removed,envy would imply the wish for roles to be switch false in this case the socialist goal is to destroy the rich person thats the point of that picture in this subreddit then after the very rich are destroyed so must be the middle class that are richer than the poor
socialism,removed,see with your ideology of fairness anyone that has more stuff had to exploit someone in marxist terms society is divided into two major classes the bourgeoisie those who own the means of production and receive profits and the working class those who have only their labour to sell the latter is being exploited by the former correct but that is still an emotional response to others having more not until everyone is equally poor and on a sustenance level existence is your dream completed imo you can not win your socialist argument when someone draws a comic of who you want to no longer exist so you are incorrect claiming my point is false
socialism,removed,theres a story about an envious person that fills in the well of someone that has a much better well that is you you can never be happy until everyone has either the best wells or they all have the worst the latter is the only one you can get in the real world the only way i can agree with you is to throw out human nature and or the logical outcome of what you want constantly implemented
socialism,removed,your definition of envy is off too httpdictionarycambridgeorgdictionaryenglishenvy then you tell me what word i should use for the people that would destroy a water well another person has simply because its better than all the other wells
socialism,removed,i understand what you are saying what you do not understand is that socialists would destroy the single best well others have access to because that gives them an unfair advantage you argue socialist would destroy the best wells others have access to right here its to give everyone the same access to the same opportunities
socialism,removed,the ops drawing and others here have clearly explained who socialists want eliminated also i never argued that filling in a well you are envious of is stealing it i would never argue that the principle of robbing people you envy so there are no more rich people is just simply stealing feel free to give me the proper label to use for a people that would fill in the best well in the world because others have an unfair advantage with it
socialism,removed,you are incorrect because destroying something because of envy is not capitalizing on it at best its capitalizing on a destructive emotion
socialism,removed,well this is the definition of an ignorant post
socialism,removed,false accusation are a vanishingly small phenomenon at least of all accusations in feministactivist circles its more like
socialism,removed,were you not here when they banned left communists for being sectarian thats not just banning liberals thats literally banning dissent
socialism,removed,i love this because it fails to name any specifics of how socialism works while also offering an alternative that it never addresses if given a fair alternative so yeah competition is good and stifling it leads to shitty situations where idiots think that the only solution is to sieze muh production
socialism,removed,lol because there arent any because it doesnt work
socialism,removed,thats okay these things happen
socialism,removed,no they are brave for what you said but that doesnt make them any less retarded
socialism,removed,no not really like i said as long as you move there and conform to the culture it is alright
socialism,removed,this is fucking terrifying you guys are morons if mym and my friends save up money and want to open our own bar to play music we likeplay sports we wanna watch and eventually when it gets popular and we need to hire some more waiters wed be seen as evil private property owners by socialists jesus christ how have you not already seen through this moronic
socialism,removed,i thought my point was obvious the beggars werent actually homeless and were professional beggars you actually never see them sleeping on the streets
socialism,removed,if one is a scammer and a serial criminal yes they should be jailed and deported i would want a serial rapist be jailed and deported if possible being a scammer and a criminal is a choice after all many knowingly come from other countries just to beg and that kind of harassment of others should not be okay to be legit homeless for example in finlandand id think other nordic countries too you have to make a choice not to opt for the last resort social safety or use that money for something else than housing
socialism,removed,more likely it provides a convenient explanation for the absence of such
socialism,removed,they do say one and one makes three i could easily see a cult of personality developing if a physical monument was there in living colour like mussolini and ghandi whoa im a cult of personality a cult of personality a cult of personalityyy
socialism,removed,when will cuba have free and honest elections
socialism,removed,im a luxemburgist who leans more towards anarchism in terms of ethics but thanks for assuming im just an edgy moron who smashes windows
socialism,removed,what is your viewpoint on lenin want the soviet union a massive failure
socialism,removed,well yea its not for free
socialism,removed,im sorry but im just a visitor i just wanted a perspective on lenin from a user here curious if they have any pragmatic ideologies not rooted in delusion and emotionalized fervor its easy to get worked up over something when conveniently ignoring the sad truth to things
socialism,removed,its great that she survived the taliban attack and shes a leader in antiislamism in pakistan but she is only she has no college education etc is she really a valid source of knowledge about economics socialism ie ownership of factories industries by the government may not be so exploitative but it also hasnt been very successful at creating wealth all the countries that have tried it cuba venezuela ussr ukraine china east germany bolivia kazakhstan egypt iran north korea are or were significantly poorer than countries with more vibrant markets relatively more private wealth it may not be distributed well but thats a different issue the fact that its created at all is important so i disagree with this sub you should all reconsider
socialism,removed,well if thats your opinion then so be it i thank you anyways comrade its funny my parents live in the soviet system for most of their lives they still praise it but its funny to watch them come to america and struggle i still sting lenin songs sometimes socialism is an utter failure in modern times undeniably so and everyone says its because it wasnt done right so how do you think it should be done
socialism,removed,please tell me what they mean the suspense is killing me
socialism,removed,inlcuding you lol
socialism,removed,what in the fuck rsocialism retarded as always

socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,so by riot what do you meanhe was elected by the peopleunless evidence is published about his connection to russiathen sit down
socialism,removed,fuck yes kill that guy
socialism,removed,socialism is an intrinsically inclusive system and we believe all people are born equal and deserve equal voices in society unless you dont like what they say in that case they get banned hypocrites
socialism,removed,so what do you proposedo you want to over throw the government and create a new socialist governmentif you love socialism so much why dont you migrate to russa china or north koreathose are all socialist counties
socialism,removed,get rekt commie scum look at venezuela socialism is a fraud and youre all tools
socialism,removed,haha you all suck
socialism,removed,yes a great victory its nice to see more exclusionary public marches no i presume you are also a big supporter of klan marches
socialism,removed,yeah i can see it now losers who cant find jobs try to overthrow a year establishment
socialism,removed,kill yourself comrade
socialism,removed,im sure the insurance will pay for it except for the fact that theres no rental vehicle clause in those kinds of insurance policy so this guy who is probably just a driver trying to make ends meet is going to be now out of work for a couple of weeks while this gets fixed and according to statistics hes probably not going to have the savings to cover a couple weeks out of work while his livelihood was destroyed
socialism,removed,lol
socialism,removed,just teenagers doing teenagers things since they dont own things they dont understand the value of them
socialism,removed,there will probably be a race war before a class war
socialism,removed,just remember not take showers when a alt right ask you
socialism,removed,thats shallow minded just like your beliefs theres no difference in communism or socialism then the government still controls the means of distribution
socialism,removed,the sentiment is nice but the problem is that
socialism,removed,yeah lets all be poor
socialism,removed,yeah my government check came today why do i need to get a job again
socialism,removed,whats so great about it its just empty circlejerking it might as well say trump is the cure for socialism equally empty baseless statement
socialism,removed,and the cure part of socialism means putting every one of you bourgeoisie motherfuckers on your knees for a free bullet
socialism,removed,fuck you
socialism,removed,i love islam let those fight in the way of allah who sell the life of this world for the other whoso fighteth in the way of allah be he slain or be he victorious on him we shall bestow a vast reward good job hijackers

socialism,removed,bhaiya jnu ka toilet ganda pada hai din se saaf kab kroge
socialism,removed,people always assume youre an sjw
socialism,removed,yeah the corbyn love is sickening especially since people here claim the dprk isnt socialist
socialism,removed,the antistalinism is really horrible
socialism,removed,my political model is stalin hoxha too and i really dont think stalin would have been an sjw sjws take things that are good like antiracism and take it to an extreme like defending islam and pc culture
socialism,removed,yeah that was pretty bad but it wasnt just stalins fault that was a democratic decision made by the people of the ussr i think gay people are fine im against pc culture but we definitely shouldnt be putting queer people in prison
socialism,removed,because i used to be a socialist and still like reading about it also just wondering why people dont like capitalism
socialism,removed,unfortunately the only people willing to do so are alqaeda and isis if there was a secular antiamerican army in the world id join it even if it means i and my family would have to die if the rest of the world could somehow obliterate the us before it knew what hit them thed be champagne in the streets of paris and fireworks in tehran a good start is to go after cops and infants the first for their complicity and the latter to be feared
socialism,removed,the only way we can win this war is to go after officers and their families the police industrial complex will break into a weeping mess once they find the raped and cannibalized corpses of their children and dogs
socialism,removed,deceitful suits you i agree
socialism,removed,you better call youre queen
socialism,removed,guess whos gonna fail this year
socialism,removed,the time for peace and pacifism is over killing is good not killing is evil civilization natural resources the earth herself cannot stand the continued american militarypoliceindustrial complex it is time humanity kills as many of them as possible to thrashing rammstein raping them in every orifice in their body and making north america run with the blood of the globalist exceptionalist plague who must be removed as a cancer and that their accomplices those who do not join in the cleansing also meet their maker so we can save the biosphere and save civilization killkillkillkillkill m
socialism,removed,im white they dont want my help let them do it themselves
socialism,removed,are you appointing yourself to a leadership position among the protesters i bet theyll be pleased for your sacrifice im sure they would just love being preached to about the prison industrial complex and the war on drugs during the protest concerning another matter as well i mean since they were not discussing those topics upon your arrival at the protest then they must not discuss it period im sure theyll listen to everything you have to say report back on how this works out
socialism,removed,welcome to reddit political subs where if youre not as ideological pure as the next person then youre literally a neoliberal fascist my point is dont take this sub as a fair representation of how socialist are irl
socialism,removed,however i cant help but feel turned off entirely by this sub a lot of it has to do with the sense of militancy around here it feels like anybody who hasnt gotten on board with socialism yet is immediately branded as a capitalist sellout who is comfortable being under the foot of the bourgeoisie because theyre not sure that violent revolution is the way forward either that or people are extremely condescending im not a socialist in good part because of the reason you outline here but i feel like i understand why this might be the case so i hope you dont mind me responding socialists do not view themselves as engaged in an open intellectual debate where their preferred ideology is one among many and there is a genuine possibility that they may have to abandon their ideology as the debate progresses rather socialists view themselves as embroiled in a literal war against a hostile ruling class the only just thing from a socialists point of view is to destroy all other ideologies there may be considerable free debate within socialism itself of course but nothing outside of socialism may exist to compromise on this point would be to cede ground in this very real physical war being nice towards the adherents of other ideologies has no value beyond the tactical purpose of potentially converting them or pacifying them if neither option seems like a possibility then why not simply make it clear to them that they are the enemy after all failing to be a socialist means contributing to the real material oppression of people more than what already necessarily follows from being a consumer under capitalism this may sound like a harsh description but would any socialist deny it would any socialist be satisfied with having a debate with neoliberalism a debate in which neoliberalism might simply win and everyone would decide to become neoliberals that would surely be a miscarriage of justice no ask yourself about your own material conditions are you generally happy and financially stable would it be better for you if the existing order were wiped away in a violent revolution or worse if the answer is worse that may explain the perceived gap in militancy between you and the members of this forum based on their personal accounts it seems that many people here have nothing to lose and you shouldnt feel bad for failing to identify with the interests of another group of course no one has a compulsion to go against their own interests
socialism,removed,the persons a leftcom so
socialism,removed,give him some credit as much as hes a twat he did bring peace to northern ireland and new labour did have some good achievements
socialism,removed,as a social democrat as well you may want to join us at rsocialdemocracy it doesnt get as much traffic so it is always good to have more people this sub does tend to require discussion around the assumption that revolution is necessary in some ways it limits discussion but it also helps narrow the topic otherwise much discussion would be centred around that topic pushing out revolutionary socialist issues you should know however that most of the militancy being discussed is not armed insurgency and civil war it is rather extrainstitutional forms of democracy such as strikes protests riots and education discourse even an evolutionary social democrat will necessarily support much of this but with the goal of affecting the current system as a result the revolution the dismantling of the existing system does not necessarily come out of civil war which is likely the larger trigger for autocratic takeover that being said as you can see here there are mixed opinions of stalin and mao while you have debates and arguments on this sub over such people there is a tendency to discuss them in a more academic sense rather than an emotional one these states were not in good situations when their painful revolution occurred societies in a weakpoor position effectively have no good solution this isnt like western politics where it is easier to make decisions because of material capability while these leaders can be analysed as misguided especially mao in my opinion or making downright stupid choices pol pot they are not doing so in a context of their choosing the phillipines is a good modern day example with rampant corruption and crime is vigilantism an overall net positive or negative whatever the case it is not the same to compare their experience to the us this is also true for the autocratic takeover of these revolutionscommunism is not the only variable affecting them this is why you will see a different analysis for fascist states especially for germany the very disruptions to autocracy was not actually revolution but material deprivation also a variable for russia and china the policies implemented were not misguided misinformed poorly executed or outright idiotic they were deliberately intended and even to that degree for the holocaust was at a cost not an intention for a net gain as the ussr and china this is even true for italys colonialism though only for one side anyway the discussions you see here will usually reflect more contextual variables than in most public discourse which is honestly an emotional trigger from propaganda
socialism,removed,i mean its not secret capitalism doesnt work from whose perspective id imagine from a socialists perspective every other system that isnt socialism would be considered a failure wouldnt it from an american capitalists perspective capitalism has been the most successful system in the history of mankind from a historical perspective capitalism empowered america to become the world leader in civil rights economic prosperity and technological advancement starting in america and then furthered by others primarily great britain capitalism led to the ending of slavery which had existed for thousands of years prior under every other socioeconomic system that came before and has been the primary factor behind civil rights for minorities not the sole factor mind you this effort has been supported by our republic system of government vs a full democracy since a pure democracy would oppress the minority leftists in america today argue capitalism has caused many of the problems we face today these claims are misconceptions however and do not hold up under scrutiny which is why they appeal to peoples subjectivity instead of providing any form of empirical evidence meanwhile capitalists can and have pointed out time and again that the problems stem from anticapitalist forces such as government interventions in the economy this can be proven to be the true causes of every economic disaster in american history from the great depression when the federal government intentionally prevented the economy from recovering which had a much larger impact than they expected and led to a depression lookup the creation of the federal reserve to the recent recession our government both directly through governmentbacked financial institutions and indirectly through government incentives like guaranteed interest profits to other institutions led to a substantial increase in subprime loans which would not have occurred naturally in a capitalist system and when people began defaulting on those loans the market collapsed so now why should the goal to be to return to american capitalism for two reasons one it has been successful and led to america becoming the superpower it is today two it is the only economic system which promotes the ideas that founded the country itself individual natural rights freedom and liberty any other system would result in the partial or complete removal of our constitutional rights under other systems like socialism and communism the rights of the individual are not promoted anyway so from that perspective it is not an issue however to the majority of americans who do believe in the rights of the individual then moving to any other system would be regress not progress
socialism,removed,sean cahill has an interesting analysis about how abortion is really a symptom of the oppression of women by patriarchal capitalism
socialism,removed,to the gulag with you
socialism,removed,too bad left coms only do the latter
socialism,removed,its fun to see left coms get salty about people wondering why they get salty about anything that actually helps people
socialism,removed,it has been established that a protester killed a protester not a cop
socialism,removed,yeah angry people destroying private property are super reliable witnesses good thing there are security cameras
socialism,removed,im assuming youve never heard of an untainted jury so ill give your ignorant comment a pass
socialism,removed,cuck alert cuck found the cuck you cuckcuckglobalization is cuck you fucking cuck hitler wasnt a cuck
socialism,removed,thats a good question in general but i think bickering is a dysphemistic way to refer to the serious discussions that go on here what really pains me is that we actually have rules here that prevent some legitimate discussions between socialists i mean no supporting the eu that rule is even more ridiculous when you realize that this subreddit includes a megathread for jeremy corbyn someone who was ultimately against the decision to leave the eu would jeremy corbyn be banned from rsocialism
socialism,removed,no evidence that police shot him but we should riot in the streets and blame them anyway calling hypocrisy on others does not make you immune besides i merely shared the article you can draw your own conclusions no one on reddit can send this guy or a cop to jail so it makes no difference
socialism,removed,saying youre not a reformist is like saying you hate freedom
socialism,removed,thats not clever its just obnoxious and doesnt contribute to any meaningful understanding of anything but im sure you are quite self satisfied
socialism,removed,no i mean actual real freedom reform is just working people defending themselves against tyranny aka freedom being against reform is the worst treason other than the treason of what the reform is defending against
socialism,removed,nope
socialism,removed,muh narrative
socialism,removed,im sorry who is we ive been on here for years and ive been a socialist for and you are a condescending ignorant fool not only am i right its actually quite revealing that you not only dont understand what im talking about but then welcome me in like youre some superior standard bearer and im some sanders democrat who the fuck are you kid
socialism,removed,you need to stop telling me what to do son
socialism,removed,and thats good why im subbed to rsocialism and reuropean i used to be a staunch socialist communist the more i interact with subreddits like this and ranarachism the more im pushed away from the ideology why are you scared of a subreddit with subscribers why bother going on it its a small microcosm of reddit pathetic that you celebrate this and just another reason for me to turn away from socialism
socialism,removed,and why is this a good thing free speech has once again been censored i am a subsciber to both rsocialism and reuropean you guys always claim that you are against censorship and that censoring different opinions is fascist but rsocialism seems to be more than happy to have a sub that contains opinions that contradict yours shut down what a bunch of hypocrites you are for celebrating this
socialism,removed,its almost as if theyve been shipped off to labour camp the only free speech that matters is the ones that extol the glories of the working class and the vanguard of the revolutionary party
socialism,removed,how is this good news shouldnt they be allowed to discuss whatever it is that they want to discuss even if it goes against what most of us believe to be right and now i see people here saying donald trumps subreddit should be the next in line to be quarantined why because you disagree with their views
socialism,removed,the what if they censored us angle is dumb because we are not being censored and we are not the same as these people according to whom you take a good look around this sub from time to time i really hate this tendency everywhere to pretend that anything that goes against my views etc need to be censored on the internet
socialism,removed,freedom of speech
socialism,removed,i was a relatively frequent visitor to reuropean i realise there was a lot of hate but one thing ill miss is the alternative viewpoint on the refugee crisis i just dont know where i can go on reddit now that doesnt push diversity is our strength even though studies have shown the opposite to be true youd help more people if we developed the refugee camps closer to syria the place where the actual refugees come from people are acting like if we dont give up resources to these economic migrants from a system theyve never paid in to then were terrible oppressive racists i just dont see how travelling through multiple peaceful countries to arrive in germany should give you the inalienable right to everything they can give you in an ideal world i wouldnt have to go to places like reuropean to discuss these viewpoints but these views have become so condemned that choices are limited more and more these viewpoints are getting removed entirely rather than discussed well whatever judging from the comments here i guess you people are just a different new type of fascist thats just landed on the other side of the spectrum than the people who visited reuropean
socialism,removed,indeed thats a sad news it doesnt even make sense if someone has a problem with your views atleast on the internet anyone can argue with them and as in the internet both of them will be honest as hell it would be clear for any unbiased bystanders who to stand with censoring views even seemingly evil ones on the internet is just stupid
socialism,removed,love to see you communists really fullfilling the cliche of antifree speech
socialism,removed,i hope the following wont give me a ban because damn this sub is a source of fine information and discourse and id be bummed if i couldnt be a part of it i will say though im not a full fledged socialist i find myself agreeing most with anarchocommunism but i feel as if a point should be made though im sure its been spoken of in the other post about this human beings are free to think as they wish i dont think we should be celebrating the censorship of a group we dont agree with what if it were left forums which were censored i realize the whole oh free speech only protects you from government prosecution not criticism from your fellow countrymen notion its quite true but jeez thats what it should be valid criticism not censorship online forums should reflect every part of current human nature if people see there are communities projecting hate suppression of freedom and beliefs in equality then they will realize those communities are wrong if such beliefs are so wrong a rational person would never think of being a part of it but a rational and more so a virtuous person would not try to suppress others when they believe suppressing others is wrong its hypocritical i see these posts as genuinely informative its news but i just cant get down with the celebratory comments its news that should go without reaction show some humility with your satisfaction theres fights to be fought but not like this not by censorship
socialism,removed,yeah that was a disgusting sub no doubt but is no one else bothered by this under what grounds were they quarantined how do we know that rsocialism would not be quarantined by reddit mods in the future under similar grounds i mean i see this sub often post some very antizionist things many people claim that antizionism is a form of antisemitism i can see someone using that logic to try to get this place banned
socialism,removed,what if reddit mods one day said hey look at these guys they oppose israels occupation of palestine they are clearly jewhating racist antisemites lets ban their sub
socialism,removed,its almost like they were able to make jokes about the situation while still being unhappy about it enjoy your prehighschool summer brave socialists
socialism,removed,there are plenty of hate speech movements that have a duality to them and i dont believe you should censor these ideas its pretty easy to spot the obvious ie i hate niggers because theyre different sort of folks and it is understandable to ban them banning those who bring up rapecrimesocialetc statistics with sources concerning to construct an argument on why they feel objectively this race is bad is silly you can disagree with these ideas and throw rebuttals as is the point with discussion boards but as soon as you censor these ideas you limit the integrity of the board and everyone gets tunnel vision ie radical feminists tbh i havent frequented this sub or reuropean since these initial posts and i doubt i will again so i am ignorant to what actually took place
socialism,removed,do you support charging women who get abortions with murder yes unless it was a rape or it poses a risk to her health
socialism,removed,yay censorship great job guys while is this good news who cares that they were total prices of shit they werent brigading and were keeping to them selves also dont use the shitty well it hate speech argument becuase who gives a fuck are you people really that affected by words on the internet british national party is a great example of why you let shitheads talk
socialism,removed,censorship is good news
socialism,removed,everyone is starving and eating rats because of socialism ban me its the socialist way to silence dissidents
socialism,removed,the black market usd causing inflation is called dutch disease basically an economy cant survive without a currency a foreign currency a currency that is trusted unlike the fun bucks in venezuela
socialism,removed,wew i can see you dont want to argueput effort into any sort of discussion and ultimately arent worth my time enjoy your circlejerk
socialism,removed,so inflation improvedbut you will still blame it
socialism,removed,you pretty much affirmed youre not here for discussion and have tunnelvision as aforementioned its easily inferred from my previous post that i was on my way out good luck discussing one viewpoint
socialism,removed,youre looking into my history now and downvoting me now whew getting desperate
socialism,removed,yeah stalin hitler and mao were all socialist fucks
socialism,removed,stalin the biggest war criminal in the world hitler on the other hand was a perfect man such a kind hearted man who loved his people national socialism is the best form of socialism
socialism,removed,im legit asking man
socialism,removed,while i agree with every criticism of hillary presented here she is truly deplorable i still feel i must ask if you live in a state where it matters shouldnt you still vote for her we shouldnt see voting as a way of enacting true change we should see it as a form of damage control we know the change we need will never come about through voting or reform but the revolution will have a much harder time under a fascist than a neoliberal more people will be hurt by the fascist than the neoliberal the system is broken and we shouldnt place any of our hopes into it by why not lessen the damage it can cause where we are able five minutes in a voting booth doesnt invalidate days of direct action
socialism,removed,but black people sold us slaves they actively participated in the exploitation of their own people by trading them with western powers not only this but whites were also enslaved in many parts of the world
socialism,removed,my point is that these things happened in a context where they werent at all uncommon it does not mean that we are still motivated by them or that the problems facing minorities now are necessarily because of race
socialism,removed,firstworldproblems
socialism,removed,why are white people so fucking stupid
socialism,removed,its also obvious that you cant be racist to white people
socialism,removed,thank you for proving my point
socialism,removed,i think blm is an important and necessary movement today sorry to disappoint you but its possible to look at issues like this with nuance instead of being a retard about everything the fact that youre trying to conflate idiots criticizing a game set in africa where you kill african zombies who happen to be black with a social protest movement over the murder of innocent black people by police in america shows that youre just a giant idiot people like you have no ability to take each issue as it comes everything is met with a blanket nutjob reaction
socialism,removed,are you actually being serious are you trying to say retard is ableist or some shit the sooner people like you grow up and stop being idiots the better youre not making the world a better place youre making it worse nice way to avoid addressing a single thing i said you child people like you cant actual conduct arguments so you resort to shouting insults and leaving in a huff you tapped out
socialism,removed,who cares about individual microlevel racism its a nonissue
socialism,removed,im here because i thought this article was preposterous and wanted to read people roasting racist dickheads instead i found idiots like you saying really dumb shit are you trying to act like you find it amusing that i practice a martial art wtf how stupid are you im guessing youre a fat useless piece of shit that hasnt gotten off their sofa in years so you react with bitter jealousy when you encounter people who are actually fit and can handle themselves not to mention the fact that if were going through peoples history youre a mod of a bunch of pathetic psycho stalker subs you need to spend more time off the internet
socialism,removed,individual microlevel racism which is ultimately meaningless and even if you could be racist against white people its completely founded i mean its not like white people tried to conquer the entire world and ruined billions of lives or anything
socialism,removed,because literally everyone will see that comment and be turned off from socialism for good
socialism,removed,individualism is white privilege im not trying to get some bougie white fucks support
socialism,removed,all the salty crackers in this thread right now be like they targeted gamers gamers were a group of people who will sit for hours days even weeks on end performing some of the hardest most mentally demanding tasks over and over and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did well punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture because we think its fun well spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second many of us have made careers out of doing just these things slogging through the grind all day the same quests over and over hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed systems over heated disks and carts destroyed frustration all to latter be referred to as bragging rights these people honestly think this is a battle they can win they take our media were already building a new one without them they take our devs gamers arent shy about throwing their money else where or even making the games our selves they think calling us racist mysoginistic rape apologists is going to change us weve been called worse things by prepubescent year olds with a shitty head set they picked a fight against a group thats already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods who enjoy the battle of attrition theyve threatened us with who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter our obsession with proving we can after being told we cant is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brotherssisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need a honed reflex gamers are competative hard core by nature we love a challange the worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us youre not special youre not original youre not the first this is just another boss fight
socialism,removed,youre getting defensive for no reason here
socialism,removed,finally you understand you are actually a piece of shit
socialism,removed,mafia despite having controversy over it doesnt look like that great of a game regardless it needs to be pushed back and polished more its too soon to release it this year i dont care about killing any group of people which is why i loved hatred for what it was doing anything you want bar following some quests i think its because of all the recent outbreaks of all the blacks on white people crime in america during blm riots that people are really disliking how theyre portraying this maybe in bad taste
socialism,removed,im disgusted at all the blackwashing everyone knows the mafia is italian but they changed history to fit their racist narrative italian people have always been discriminated against and made to be a joke and its being done again these people should be ashamed
socialism,removed,is it a train wreck because people disagree with you
socialism,removed,so i should be making a scene about my bisexuality and making a scene when i feel like my safe space is being violated when you put a single groups issues ahead of everyone else you exclude everyone and this is exactly what the faux left constantly do i dont particularly care because at the end of the day though people like this generally keep to the internet and universities it is just annoying to left wing parties everywhere that people screaming about their feelings have become to image of the left especially when these same parties have been fighting for lgbtq rights for decades only now to be told they arent doing enough because they arent abandoning everyone else in order to focus on a single minority group
socialism,removed,we all have blind spots the worst thing we can do is to ignore that fact if someone calls them out on something like this and they understand and acknowledge that then thats fine in my opinion you live you learn if they do not however then they should be called out for what they are posers full of bullshit
socialism,removed,exactlywho are the real brosocialists in this scenario probably the ones with a penis for a majority for their lives
socialism,removed,i know plenty of marxists irl who get branded terfs for being critical of liberal feminism i dont even bother trying to explain the difference between revolutionary feminists and terfs any more im gonna try saying some critical things now and see what happens the idea of inherent gender identity is just a new face on reinforcing traditional sex stereotypes allowing males into female spaces can be an uncomfortable experience for victims of male violence among others and needs to be handled carefully gender is a class a lived experienced relationship with the systems around you presentation can change the way you interact with the patriarchy and the world at large but claiming to have lived the same experiences as a woman because you feel like a woman or present as a woman but were raisedlivedlive as a man is offensive and only partially true at best i dont know any marxists who dont think trans people face discrimination and deserve our solidarity and support one of the largest issues is that trans individuals are involved in violence related to the sex trade at alarmingly high rates compared to the non trans population i know plenty who also agree with the things i wrote above and are accordingly terfs its actually one of the larger differences i notice between the communist and anarchist communities queer feminism is prevalent in anarchist circles its not in communist circles except on the internet at least that i see rant aside i have no idea who this twitter account is and they may very well be a reactionary but alluding to danielle muscato not being a woman doesnt make you a reactionary
socialism,removed,really im a frequent visitor to those subs never seen anyone ask for trans death
socialism,removed,tfw transgenderism is reactionary but then the leftists calling it reactionary are called reactionary themselves by the reactionaries
socialism,removed,i dont understand at what point did marxists become more absorbed in petty social rhetoric than in the actual revolution someone should be there to critique those who do this very thing divert our attention to issues that can be fixed after the revolution we will not win our war by doing this i guarantee you that should we continue down this course we are doomed to extinction
socialism,removed,and countless of us whether it be for our political affiliations our religion or lack thereof or any other denoting factor have died not being able to see the revolution and on top millions upon millions of us will die in the armed struggle to come and yet we squander over a few lives today lets get real yes its disgusting yes its wrong yes not only does it need to be stopped but those who instigate it must be punished equally however i see these posts almost everyday and i sometimes question todays marxists dedication to the cause this was a nonissue for mao stalin lenin che whoever it is you look up to we must realign ourselves with our original purpose in all of this the equality of all after the expulsion of elements like these from society
socialism,removed,how is that a codeword for neonazism there is some vaguely fascist rhetoric but i dont see the kind of militancy and racism i would usually associate with neonazis i think some neonazis identify with the altright in some ways but they seem to be at the extreme fringe not really sure how youre equating the two
socialism,removed,maybe if you stopped constantly insulting straight white men more would support you
socialism,removed,trans exclusionary politics has no place in socialism your version of trans politics that implies women from different cultures arent socialized as women is not something i have any desire to be associated with either nor with kink culture nor anything promoted by the fetishists on asktg nor anything from the section of the trans movement you seem to participate in and represent i can exclude misogynists without excluding trans people as a group misogynist fetishists dont represent trans people
socialism,removed,you seem to love to attack me rather than my arguments i attack your argument when i attack the part where you implied that women from other cultures arent raised as women thats ridiculous because women across the world are raised to conform to female sex stereotypes this is especially offensive in the context of a conversation about male violence which is something women all across the world are confronted with in a world where transgender sexuality is highly fetishized and taken from us by the mainstream this is a huge problem that nobody you would describe as a terf disagrees with a person who grew up male dominating other people sexually just like the way you were raised to dominate people as a male is neither a solution or revolutionary if women grow up to like this kind of male domination so much that they choose to participate in it on either side it still reproduces the same dynamics of submissiveness and violence if you were socialized to dominate women its definitely not revolutionary some people get off on submissiveness most sexual preferences arent antipatriarchy all the time but most people also dont pretend like they are
socialism,removed,also if they advocate a new world order that involves removing anyone who disagrees by murdering them thats a straight up nazi
socialism,removed,reproducing patriarchal power structures of violence and submission is not revolutionary for anyone being or having been a male certainly doesnt make perpetuating structures of male violence any better trans women arent socialized as men were socialized as trans women socialization comes from society society has a binary conception of gender mainstream society does not have a set of sex stereotypes outside of men and women if you were expected to conform to expectations of boys you were raised as a boy if you were expected to act like a girl you were socialized as a girl if you dont fit the conceptions of boyhood or manhood and are discriminated against because of it thats a form of patriarchal oppression but its not the same thing as being raised as a trans woman society cant socialize you as a trans woman because trans women buck the patriarchal binary system most people accept
socialism,removed,when people see destroy the cishetero patriarchy they see the words destroy and yet youre the one who doesnt feel safe you know what nobody actually gives a shit if a person wants to declare themselves female despite being according to every accepted definition of the word male nobody cares nobody cares one person making a jibe on twitter does not an oppression make oh look heres john or is it lisa now haha id better make a joke out of it because im a liberal minded guy but the goalposts keep changing so often i dont know how to avoid offence i wonder what lisas take on donald trump is oh ill never find out because she i can never work out which is constantly banging on about cisgendered patriarchy oh look chelsea have scored but lisa doesnt want to engage in this mindless conversation all i wanted to do was form a social connection over a transient pastime but lisa wants to focus on the marketisation of masculinity and then take umbridge at the forcing of common cultural standards upon him her which ones gonna set off the trigger this is stressful i only wanted a pint and a chat jeez and why does she spit the word cis as though it somehow lessens me as a human being like it was my fucking choice to be born normal fuck me right im male but i fuck women im not rich but not poor and i need factor in a heatwave fuck me actually no fuck you im sick of feeling guilty ive got zero power over this pointless animosity but the one thing i can do is make a joke blatant transphobia or blatant ignorance of a matter that becomes less clear by the day
socialism,removed,what was the tweet about how white people were massacred abs how that was a good thing then the one that came after the white genocide tweet that he used to clarify what it meant just a silly joke
socialism,removed,please stop following me around reddit and commenting on everything i post youve been pinging me regularly
socialism,removed,im not offended but psychologically speaking telling a group of people that they are all privilegedracisttransphobichomophobicect does nothing but drive them away and breed resentment if you want to form a movement based on antiwhite sentiment go ahead but dont expect me to not fight you on it
socialism,removed,no yes and certainly not here this one was gratis
socialism,removed,as a white supporter of donald trump i could give a fuck what george ciccariellomaher has to say about white genocide it was a clear attempt at satire albeit a shitty one that shouldnt be taken literally he was trying to be funny and it didnt work big whoop having said that after reading the article i support the university backing the right to free speech what i dont understand is how this sort of absurd attempt at satire is grounds for support but jordan petersons fight against legislation that would make it so refusal to use gender pronouns would be a hate crime is universally condemned by university i feel like free speech should be consist across the board but it certainly seems that in these situations university boards cherry pick their cases and support
socialism,removed,how is transgender ideology compatible with the abolition of gender
socialism,removed,information is verifiable foreign and internal actors are engaging in systematic misinformation campaigns designed to advance their interests this is cyber warfare but i guess youre okay with it as long as it supports your narrative
socialism,removed,ah yes those female and child slave masters that were guaranteed their safety by the man who eventually ordered the massacre you know after they won the initial conflict and the french army fled it wasnt even an act of war it was senseless slaughter of many innocent people but you know you do you
socialism,removed,i dont mean to make you uncomfortable by using that phrase i know some people dislike the term transgenderism lets say the doctrine of gender identity or any term that you prefer the things that transgender activists and supporters believe if youre not into the whole brevity thing
socialism,removed,its twitter man you throw some wild shit out there youll get some wild shit back i mean what would be the fun in it if he threw that statement out there and got a weak reaction the guy was fishing for something strong and he accomplished what he set out to do which was piss people off i dont support this guy offing himself and i dont support white genocide what i do support is good entertainment and i gotta admit this professor set the stage for a shit show
socialism,removed,i think its the double standard they are focusing on it also sits well with their narrative that the academia has been infiltrated by progressives cultural marxists or sjws i am never sure who are working towards this goal the whole left and right ideology is nonsense and it just divides people maybe i should stop posting as i feel i will get banned any minute now reading your sub stuff
socialism,removed,no for fucks sake she attempted to kill two israeli with a knife stabbed one in the head then got shot and later on sentenced she even posted on fucking facebook before the attack about how she wants to die for palestinia what a piece of shit article what is it with all the antisemitic posts rising to the top here right now would anybody bat an eye at a terrorist getting sentenced for multiple years to prison for attempted murder in another country
socialism,removed,this article is infuriating obvious propaganda piece trying to demonize israelis as oppressors the young girl in question was a terrorist she posted on facebook on how she was planning to die a martyr she had a recorded conversation with her mother how she was planning to die a martyr and she should not weep for her then she went out and attack israeli men with a knife stabbed one in the shoulder and head got shot sentenced later on as a terrorist all of this has been conveniently left out in this antisemitic propaganda piece instead replaced with rumors of how she had been harassed before distasteful that shit like this can get this many upvotes youd think i was on raltright
socialism,removed,im not going to do it myself but i dont think stalinists are particularly revolutionary characters anyway not really a loss
socialism,removed,oh great maoism just the kind of popular authentic communist movement i can get behind
socialism,removed,fuck yall
socialism,removed,oh god you are a stirnerist good luck with that
socialism,removed,i am personally against abortion but am still pro choice because i see abortion as an emergency procedure and not as a willynilly form of contraception for loose women as fox news might have us believe but to your point how is being pro life reactionary their belief is that terminating a pregnancy is murder whats wrong with thinking that
socialism,removed,theyre mostly edgy teenagers dank ageism brah
socialism,removed,theyre mostly edgy teenagers if anythings edgy it sure as fuck is stirnerism illegalism is the literal congealment of pure distilled edgy teenagerism and im an illegalist youre right in other respects though
socialism,removed,thats homophobic
socialism,removed,addendum til that people whose ancestors were brought to this country in chains and who essentially can be murdered by the police without recourse are labour aristocrats the firstworld marxist with no where else to go when confronted with the reality of working class parasitism is gonna point to the integrated black population and see real exploited people this is just like how the murderous imperialist regime that represents their interests points to the integrated black population and says see look how progressive we are we integrated black people therefore we have the right to tell you what to do and the truth is that yes they are imperialists too lenin once wrote a short piece called the work is definitely worth reading in its entirety as its shortness conceals a huge depth of theoretical insight basically lenin is making a comparison between the lives of american negroes circa and russians to quote lenin it is a permissible comparison the negroes were the last to be freed from slavery and they still bear more than anyone else the cruel marks of slavery—even in advanced countries—for capitalism has no room for other than legal emancipation and even the latter it curtails in every possible way half a century later the russians still show many more traces of slavery than the negroes indeed it would be more accurate to speak of institutions and not merely of traces but in this short article we shall limit ourselves to a little illustration of what we have said namely the question of literacy it is known that illiteracy is one of the marks of slavery in a country oppressed by pashas purishkeviches and their like the majority of the population cannot be literate in russia there are per cent of illiterates exclusive of children under nine years of age among the us negroes there were in per cent of illiterates so lenin going by a single dimension of measure literacy concludes that the average russian had it worse off than the average black person in amerika in the this is still true today where the life options available to the average black amerikan are far beyond what they are to the average russian much less most other people in the world this is why the national liberation war amongst the black population never materialized it is precisely because they are bought off parasites and every war that continues to happen under us imperialism is further proof of it and generally comes with even more concessions to this population as the bourgeoisie seems to be in perpetual fear of them revolting something which the left in amerika has all but completely played out as a mechanism for getting larger pieces of the imperialist pie
socialism,removed,blm is essentially cancer they care more about social issues than they do labor not to mention they themselves are a racist movement
socialism,removed,it has nothing to do with laziness your elitism will be your downfall the fact is most people are unable to find jobs and the only jobs available for most people are minimum wage jobs that do not pay the bills in any way shape or form the fact is immigrants inflate the labor market and cause a decrease in overall wages by supporting such a system youre essentially a bourgeois puppet
socialism,removed,i care about the proletariat of my nation im not willing to lower my standard of living just so one of your marginalized groups can achieve a slightly higher standard of living if they want a better life they will need to build it in their own country either through revolution or other means
socialism,removed,peeps you can no longer be taken seriously after using that word not that you were in the first place
socialism,removed,lel stay mad mautist
socialism,removed,whats the matter did i trigger you
socialism,removed,why do you ask
socialism,removed,are you not used to having one of the unwashed masses interrupt your elitist circle jerk
socialism,removed,official putin propaganda channel talking about trust lol
socialism,removed,daily reminder the black panthers were maoists anarchists have done nothing for black people
socialism,removed,where are the articles whining about the taliban
socialism,removed,we are but what about nature sorry son doesnt figure in communist literature
socialism,removed,an anarchist that a follows apt leaders those most suited for the task at hand b honours the intelligence of unself the unspeakable context before that of the self mind and emotions
socialism,removed,heres a sneak peek of using the of all time im a bot beep boop httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
socialism,removed,a bunch of armed neo nazis confronted on the streets by antifa nuts what could possibly go wrong i mean right wouldnt it be lovely if theres a huge slaughter that ignites the powder keg
socialism,removed,it has some tankies to say they are generally tankies shows a general lack of knowledge of the subreddit and its members im there im not a tankie you can be there too
socialism,removed,innocent man who dies by execution is far too much for me think of the precedent you set by saying these things
socialism,removed,the kulaks deserved worst
socialism,removed,they should let one of us handle him its a shame the churchgoers who survived forgave him
socialism,removed,i think that bernie sanders and jeremy corbyn have a high chance of being actual socialists in their personal political viewpoints but when it comes to campaigning they tone it down to a social democrat level because they know they have a lot to lose by alienating the countrys voters dem soc flair hmmmm perhaps this is one of the many reasons why a socialist can not be voted in to transition the country to socialism
socialism,removed,its true i have no idea what they have knocking around in their heads and maybe this is part of coping for them but i wish people were as harsh about fascist actions as fascists think they are
socialism,removed,if universal basic income becomes a thing i have no issue with extreme wealth as long as everyones necessities are taken care of extreme wealth is much less offensive aggressive taxation is a yes for me but wealth caps seems a bit too authoritarian again this is if universal basic income or something like it becomes a thing which seems inevitable
socialism,removed,so stupid question by what criteria should you define a marxist there are so many different schools of thought based on marx and always has been im sure were all familiar with the time marx declared i am not a marxist in response to a group of selftitled marxists i think ol karl was utterly brilliant and a necessary starting point for understanding class but despite the impression one could get from certain communists the man was not infallible
socialism,removed,can anyone give any conceptual justification for a proposal like this
socialism,removed,im a labour member and jeremy sanders supporter and i still think this is a bad idea
socialism,removed,labour increasingly becoming irrelevant this is beautiful
socialism,removed,like really thats the only reason one could ever reasonably support something like this i dont like the idea of rich people and i hate them so lets make a law that makes it so there are no rich people no economic or logical reason to do this whatsoever people wonder why we dont take socialists seriously its because most of them just hate rich people and dont actually know wtf they are talking about
socialism,removed,on the second page number however there were other aspects to trumps engagement with the russian authorities one which had borne fruit for them was to exploit trumps personal obsessions and sexual perversion in order to obtain suitable kompromat compromising material on him according to source d where she had been present trumps perverted conduct in moscow included hiring the presidential suite of the ritz carlton hotel where he knew president and mrs obama whom he hated had stayed on one of their official trips to russia and defiling the bed where they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform a golden showers urination show in front of him the hotel was known to be under fsb control with microphones and concealed cameras in all the main rooms to record anything they wanted to
socialism,removed,i oppose capitalism not the death penalty not literally everything that happens in capitalism is horror i breath air under capitalism and while i oppose capitalism i do not oppose breathing air just because it happens under capitalism it baffles me the way people bellyache about the death penalty when it isnt new or even close to the bloody crimes of capitalism you should oppose secret excecutions they commit and the murders daily perpetuated by american imperialism but killing a fascist piece of dirt is a good thing no matter who does it i understand the point of not wanting the capitalist state to gain ability to execute people slippery slope is bullshit but thats another argument but you can actually oppose the capitalist state without condemning ever single action it takes
socialism,removed,this way he cant hurt anyone else neo nazis must die every minute he lives sends the message that you can murder innocent people at random and get away with it fascists deserve no mercy in any way shape or form
socialism,removed,what do you mean now are you implying liberals arent right wing why are so many people worried about debating shouldnt we be organizing revolution i thought the whole point of socialism was about tearing down a system and putting one in place that isnt oppressive arguing with these people is pointless our concern is shattering their power with action if bullets arent flying were doing something wrong
socialism,removed,easy there no need to generalize all landlords as capitalist scum there are plenty of people who offer their homes at reasonable prices and make exceptions for their tenants this is one example of a shitty property management company and they deserve the criticism but comments like yours are so prevalent with stories like this
socialism,removed,how is that a better question the tenant signed a contract with the landlord promising to pay for service the landlord has bills too that require the money from the tenant if tenants do not pay what they promised the landlord can lose his house so what does a landlord do when someone refuses to pay
socialism,removed,thats why we need to win and seize power instead of doing nothing and bitching about the latest atrocity the fascists commits we should be shooting fascists and organizing attacks what is this shit
socialism,removed,my question wasnt about this case in general what should we do with tenants dont pay rent how long do we pay for them before kicking them out
socialism,removed,but the person without a house is the one choosing to pay to live in someone elses house if the whole landlordtenant concept didnt exist every single person who is not a homeowner would be homeless if i own houses im not forcing anyone to stay in there
socialism,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
socialism,removed,i am envisioning a beautiful suburban home confiscated from the owner and given to a family of hoarder heroin addicts who think its funny to piss on the floor how many perfectly good houses would be destroyed because they were given to people who didnt work for it and dont appreciate it once destroyed they will be given a brand new house anyway
socialism,removed,itt people who dont rent
socialism,removed,did even you read the comment chain uyouhavenorights said we can easily solve all the landlords problems by taking his apartment buildings and houses and giving them to his tenants
socialism,removed,coming in from rall this hit another sub the other day and it was purportedly found out that this person was offered numerous opportunities of people wanting to help however due to their mental health state and a desire to not be embarassed they allegedly refused assistance of any kind from various other groups and organizations while it is abhorrent that she was evicted it appears at this time with the information available that she also refused to take the steps necessary to not freeze to death
socialism,removed,i started talking briefly in discord was immediately called a troll for suggesting that socialism in practice could potentially be tested inside corporations then i was blocked i presume almost instantly
socialism,removed,why wouldnt you go to a shelter instead of freezing to death
socialism,removed,i meant after the eviction people and groups offered her places to stay she refused to do that
socialism,removed,relying on people killing themselves are you seriously suggesting that landlords make money by people committing suicide
socialism,removed,try this go visit the nearest government project housing and see how well everything is maintained make that everyones living situation people dont care to maintain things they dont pay for
socialism,removed,because the ussr was a resounding success with no corruption stalins purges were fine the people didnt recall the leaders that murdered scientists and dissidents by the hundreds of thousands because they felt they were doing a great job
socialism,removed,same anywhere in the world its called reality
socialism,removed,if shed paid her rent she wouldnt have been evicted if she had mental health problems her family failed her by not taking care of her
socialism,removed,why were supposed to be overthrowing it arent we shouldnt we be organizing attacks on the capitalist state we hate so much shouldnt we be fighting this oppression you may think its a slippery slope for the capitalists to have this power but if their system is torn down and we have the power as is what attracted me to communism the end of this horrible system then they wont have that ability but in the meantime a fascist piece of garbage still walks the earth when we could have gotten our enemies to take care of him for us why not let our enemies kill our other enemies while organizing the destruction of those enemies at the same time i feel like the biggest fault we have as socialists is never actually doing anything if you dont want capitalists killing their prisoners we should be actually fighting them and i mean actually fighting protests are not fighting molotov cocktails are fighting strikes are not fighting gunfire is fighting and im guilty of it too arguing on reddit isnt fighting the only problem anyone should have with this is that the government is capitalist not that theyre killing roof roof should be killed if a capitalist shits in the woods that isnt bad we shouldnt condemn shitting in the woods just because capitalists are doing it we should be condemning thr capitalists themselves shatter their system and shit in the woods ourselves
socialism,removed,thats not what i said but you can interpret my words how you like i wanted to talk about everyone here demonizing landlords as if theyre all serial rapist murderers when the reality is the majority of landlords are fantastic and there are more laws protecting tenants than landlords ive heard of more homeowners getting completely screwed over by horrible renters
socialism,removed,i tell you that you can use something of mine in exchange for some money if i stop letting you use thing but tell you that you still have to pay me im an asshole alright but if you stop paying me and tell me you still want to use my thing im still an asshole
socialism,removed,but they didnt freeze to death in the camps so winwin
socialism,removed,i doubt she was doing that either and how would she pay for tools materials etc to perform such upkeep and repairs if she couldnt afford for rent she the property owner should just eat the losses and allow her to stay rent free how is that fair to the property owner additionally what would you do about someone who refused to work or contribute in a commune living situation kick them out deny them access to things seems like the exact same kind of thing that happens now to those who dont pay their debts be it financial debt or labor debt
socialism,removed,i live in vancouver if you check the sub for vancouver you will find that weve been having a housing crisis for over a decade of course what ive said is anecdotal just as everything that you claimed yes i also realize housing laws are different everywhere whats your point are you saying all these threats of violence and vitriol being thrown around are acceptable because you dont like landlords so can you fuck off with that automatic dismissal of people based on your foolish assumptions of them how about you converse with someone before coming to conclusions on aspects of their life
socialism,removed,free market capitalism has given more people the opportunity to live like me than any other economic system
socialism,removed,all depends on your perspective ive been born and raised in america but i guess im middle class since i didnt grow up impoverished my parents didnt make six figures i bought all my own stuff starting at paid for my own schooling housing food etc at i started out bussing tables i went to a community college cause it was cheap ten labor vouchers says i wasnt handed anything and worked for it all and i thank whatever deity exists for the free market allowing me to do so now i have an iphone a car internet food and shelter air conditioning i assume most people on this sub have the same shit even poor people in america have a lot of this thanks to capitalism are there people richer than me sure do i care no
socialism,removed,i dont see of any evidence that she had talked about her involvement with the cia after her initial involvement
socialism,removed,sucking capitalist dick during the day in spirit sucking capitalistic dick literally during the night wax on wax off
socialism,removed,i dont see of any evidence that she add any association with the cia seems limited
socialism,removed,the only sourced links the village voice article claims that she had involvement with the cia seems limited
socialism,removed,i wouldnt be surprised if some of the post is a good sign
socialism,removed,they need to control the debate you need to control the debate you need to control the debate you need to control the debate you need to kick her off classic dsa lol
socialism,removed,shes a hack but that doesnt mean you need to kick her off classic dsa lol
socialism,removed,you said it yourself anyone can suck a dick not misogyny
socialism,removed,get a grip
socialism,removed,socialism doesnt work you fucking idiots
socialism,removed,a state socialist is made by his betraying the revolution for corn and convenience ooooooh rekt sickburn
socialism,removed,i fucking hate this american exceptional it attitude that only communists would have secret police as if the us isnt behind the largest surveillance apparatus in history as if the us doesnt have secret prisons as if the us doesnt have political prisoners as if the us doesnt torture as if the us isnt corrupt
socialism,removed,why not blame capitalism for your shotcomings thats how youll get ahead come on now
socialism,removed,tldr
socialism,removed,tldr
socialism,removed,tldr
socialism,removed,calm down faggot
socialism,removed,preyed as in offered a service that people signed on their own free will
socialism,removed,i dont defend it but i get it it would be awesome to have slaves
socialism,removed,wow fuck this subreddit more contagious than thedonald
socialism,removed,yall do realize its not beyonce and ivy park running the show over there its topshop you want not beyonce her clothes are made by topshop which is a retailer not sure you faggots realize this
socialism,removed,eh im over it
socialism,removed,that is rich coming from you guys hitler was a socialist
socialism,removed,maybe i will get banned for this but this subreddit makes me pissed
socialism,removed,why
socialism,removed,yeahhhhh i mean its not socialism obv just neolibtardism
socialism,removed,dude youre using the word comrade and preaching
socialism,removed,verb riˈtärd delay or hold back in terms of progress development or accomplishment should we discuss connotation etymology
socialism,removed,yeah right
socialism,removed,hopefully they will take advantage of the worker is an agent of capital
socialism,removed,marxismreaganism please explain
socialism,removed,i support palestine but dont really see why this is some sort of active corporate oppression
socialism,removed,nor have i heard a single injun ever utter even one syllable for the common good
socialism,removed,no need to prolong something that wont work rsocialism
socialism,removed,how much money is contained in the bag at the top of the pyramid or does this chart just imply that the rich have unlimited amounts of capital and can spendinvestsave indiscriminately also does this chart take into account the fact that many rich people are not rich their entire lives ie that wealth fluctuates in a capitalist system and therefore financial capital is quite fluid
socialism,removed,can anyone list me socialist countries where people actually have good lives
socialism,removed,you didnt answer my question
socialism,removed,why do you assume that people on the bottom are the ones working the hardest and suffering do rich people not work hard or suffer
socialism,removed,i have read marx all three volumes of capital also lenin trotsky and mao that being said you didnt answer my question
socialism,removed,also why are you so quick to assume that anyone who questions marxism hasnt read marxism
socialism,removed,youre very condescending i personally think marxism is a hive of terrible ideas not the least because you are so mean but also because your chart is based on the fantasy that capital is sufficient to support the fact that a class system is bad it isnt but that there is no need to take into scarcity privacy or the threat of factions
socialism,removed,thats right youre smarter than everyone i thin youre a baby dictator
socialism,removed,for centuries the church out completely and put the rich who decided where to send the military
socialism,removed,im not saying the working class whatever that means have it easy but life and economics and organizing society is much more complicated than simply assuming poor people are good and rich people are bad this is a weird kind of identity politics that i find depressing also making money in the stock market is not guaranteed see every recession of the last two hundred years
socialism,removed,thanks for the response lets say that you have a democratically run company where the workers own the means of production and democratically vote on everything what happens if those workers democratically vote to keep the company from hiring african american workers or women workers would socialist think that is right and just its democratic
socialism,removed,should i not challenge marxists then are you implying that you are all brainwashed
socialism,removed,i enjoy debating ideas and challenging socialists to defend their ideology nothing you say to me will make me think im smarter than you but it just amazes that people buy into marxism an ideology that is responsible for the deaths of millions of people also i believe that the idea that socialism just needs to be done correctly is false to believe marxism wont lead to power struggles and dictatorships and death is dangerous wishful thinking that requires one to live in complete ignorance of the evidence of history that being said if you no longer wish to keep talking i understand
socialism,removed,thats the kind of ideology that leads to death camps forced executions and genocide but maybe thats what you support
socialism,removed,no its not literally nothing about that statement is true
socialism,removed,but how would the government make it illegal it would require force wouldnt that be antidemocratic
socialism,removed,lol thats a broad accusation and kind of silly capitalism is inherently good because it forces people to interact and keep promises it has also lifted billions out of poverty across the globe its not perfect but its good on the other hand if you think that the death camps of maos great leap forward and stalins collectivism of agriculture is the preferential way to run a society than more power to you but i disagree
socialism,removed,from the same article ultimately this doesnt necessarily mean that the coming years wont turn out to be even worse or that the rule is sacred irregardless are you trying to say that longterm financial stability is a bad thing if your point about the stability of the rule is true are you not de facto logically arguing in favor of free markets
socialism,removed,this needs to be the realest
socialism,removed,ie agree with our crap or piss off
socialism,removed,conservative
socialism,removed,take the church out completely and put the rich who decided where to send the military
socialism,removed,so youre going to put alton sterling on there the convicted felon who resisted arrest while he had an illegal firearm
socialism,removed,the bankers of the wealth of the wealth of the world make their money fleecing the upper class took their cut for the really old money the ownership of land
socialism,removed,now collapse all but the top and bottom layers and you have socialism losers
socialism,removed,this needs to be pushing employment down in the system we find ourselves trapped in today
socialism,removed,comrade lenin is cool stalin is a twat and mao is a in between for me cool ideas terrible in practice
socialism,removed,kind of not with the times considering the people at bottom have iphones internet air conditioning cars access to knowledge and ideas food clothes shelter
socialism,removed,what does it say about your ideas if you cant handle criticism
socialism,removed,i dont have very much debt lifes pretty good ive got access to amazing technological advances ive got enough food that i throw away leftovers ive got hobbies and interests outside of my work and daily job if i choose i could further my education at a world class university for more degrees and knowledge or just look stuff up on the internet and read books no food shortages here no government intrusion on my life lots of freedom to do as i please life is great
socialism,removed,fuck that how is trying to look at the situation optimistically a bad thing its the people who are throwing full blown fucking tantrums that arent helping right now yes trump is our president yes it sucks but crying protesting and posting angry tirades on social media isnt going to change that fact hate anger and fear is what got trump elected and continuing to propagate it will only drive our country further apart trump is going to be our next president and thats not the end of the world the only thing we can do is look to the future and move forward things arent as bleak as they seem
socialism,removed,one of the things that the left does though is that we even insult those who agree with us for the most part dont agree with literally everything a feminist says mansplaining shitlord arent quite sure they is the best choice for a new pronoun transphobic empathyless dirtbag this turns off a lot of people in the middle who agree with liberals on the end goals but not necessarily with everything they do to reach said goals of course for us liberals are the enemy too but they are better than tje radical right
socialism,removed,lets give trump a chance to succeed not a trump supporter by any means but if you believe in the constitution then this should be your view point he was democratically elected he is legally the president therefore we have to give him a chance
socialism,removed,the key is telling people calmly and in a nonagressive way that theyre doing something wrong which is the tough part
socialism,removed,but you knowin all realitynone of you know wtf trump is going to do
socialism,removed,ive come to the conclusion that sadly fascism is part of a regular human species cycle certain members of us are inherently tribalistnativist it was an evolutionary trait that may have served us well in the stone age and now its part of our species in the absence of truly cataclysmic population reduction events over a given period of time the number of tribalists in a given society increases until it reaches a tipping point and the tribalists seize leadership of the social group in short order the tribalists find themselves at war with other tribalists and they sufficiently reduce their mutual populations such that the cycle resets tldr theyll all be killing each other soon enough try not to get in their way
socialism,removed,they did it this snarky bitching in frame form solved literally all the problems
socialism,removed,httpwwwmarxmailorgfaqsocialismandcommunismhtm you think that havent done your homework to to be an ardent communist as often as you do and not know what it means is genuinely shameful those links are chosen totally at random from a simple google search for difference between socialism and communism which is something you are perfectly capable of having done for yourself socialism and communism are extensions of the same school of thought but differ significantly in terms of execution and scope communism is more extreme than socialism by an order of magnitude if you really studied the beliefs you claim to have youd feel the same way toward socialists that you seem to want me to feel toward leftists as it stands youre demonstrating to me that you are ignorant of your own beliefs and intolerant of people who would otherwise have been your allies you join a socialist subreddit and argue frequently against socialism then get snooty when someone from a different country uses different terminology you arent a communist communism teaches equality and sharing youre just an elitist
socialism,removed,in all seriousness i think that our situation is dire enough that violent revolution is the only option fascists has taken control of the government if we dont act soon we may never get the chance for the revolution to succeed ever again id say even without foreign support wed be able to pull this off much of the population has at least one firearm and congregation is relatively easy especially with modern advances still theres a certain path to our success id say our best shot would be supporting calexit organize far left events there agitate the masses support secession from the union turn pacifica into a socialist society wed take away a big chunk of the us economy and trade on the west coast we could use that area as a future springboard for promoting revolutionary activities in the rest of the us providing refuge for refugees from the trump regime and then radicalizing them
socialism,removed,stumbled in from rall i agree with some socialist stuff but this sub is just as degenerate as the lib subs crying and scared
socialism,removed,why do you want to fight an extreme position with another capitalism works well as long as you regulate it properly it might not be perfect but i dont see how communism is going to solve your problems like some magical panacea
socialism,removed,hes spoken many times about being pro gay and gay marriage he only wants to deport people here illegally having control of your borders is not racist if your friends are going to be deported them im afraid they are in america illegally and have no right to be there islam is an ideology not a race one thats core principles are direct contradictions to how we live in the west vetting the people who follow this religion before coming into the country is not a stupid thing to do hell america already does this in many cases ops post is horrific openly wanting to start a civil war that could kill millions of people because someone with different political opinions than your own got democratically elected in grow up you and your echo chamber have drummed up so many false assumptions about donald trumps plans for america its almost frightening
socialism,removed,yeah you will be fine
socialism,removed,if you would be scared by the prospect of a militant rightwing revolt intent on setting up a theocratic system you shouldnt praise the prospect of a militant leftwing revolt intent on setting up a socialist system if you wouldnt want the tactic being done to you why would you want to do it to someone else its basic human empathy
socialism,removed,pretty much neofascists no
socialism,removed,this thread has my head spinning i didnt read the sub before i opened the comments and i expected the discussion to be about how absurd of a proposition this is and how unacceptable the us involvement in foreign nations has often been so many deluded small minded comments here getting upvotes for promoting violent revolution due to the results of a nearly split decision election as a child of canadians i support socialist forms of government but violent revolution is a childish and idiotic means to an equally corruptible end
socialism,removed,fascism corporations christianity
socialism,removed,maybe stop immigration into europe
socialism,removed,time to report a terrorist
socialism,removed,and the rape drama post in srd that wasnt humor nor an attempt at humor that was me trying to follow reddits descriptive title guideline if it was offensive im sorry because i was literally just trying to describe what was happening in the post sexist and ablest nonsense in your post history like
socialism,removed,and what is corporatism according to you
socialism,removed,millions hahahah
socialism,removed,yeah right wing gun owners who have been practicing shooting their whole lives
socialism,removed,terrorists saboteurs whatever
socialism,removed,it must be tough to read theough all that smug douchebaggery check the post again and youll see that i specifically stated those were links chosen at random from the front page of google the fact that they are not authoritarian sources was my fucking point you idiot
socialism,removed,there is no other way of achieving socialism but by making it happen voting will never do that only armed revolution can make that change armed revolution against who overwhelmingly the voice of the people the underrepresented underclass underemployed underinsured and misunderstood is not on the side of socialism overwhelmingly socialism is now an elite opinion held only by people rich enough to spend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars or to get themselves in similar amounts of debt to organize themselves into socialist cabals outside of which they have little or no contact with the outside world and absolutely no desire to give up their own inherited wealth to those actually less fortunate than themselves unions have repudiated socialist takeovers blue collar workers have repudiated socialist ideologies and the poor across the country have rejected socialist programs wherever they have seen them cropping up the only people that are flocking to socialist ideologies are the rich college kids who can only learn them because someone else built up enough capital to afford their overpriced classes dining halls dorms and safe spaces universities are resorts not communes why would these resortchildren ever willingly give up their own educational seats for others
socialism,removed,so violence is a good thing so long as you believe the other side is bad just making sure
socialism,removed,these people need to read some more popper and arendt
socialism,removed,the thing i found most frustrating is that out of the people arrested at the portland protestriot of them either had not registered to vote or had not cast a ballot its one thing to say that you have to resort to armed rebellion when you have been disenfranchised from legal means to have your voice heard in government but its entirely another when the majority of the people calling for repudiation of a candidate they opposed never even took advantage of the hardfought legal means to oppose him it just reaffirms my belief that these agitators are not serious about changing anything they just want to look like all the pictures of virtuous protesters in their textbooks the appearance of virtue rather than its actual practice
socialism,removed,the fascists arent the ones throwing bricks through shop windows demonizing the actual working class as explicit or implicit racists sexists homophobic bigots because that same working class didnt support hillary clinton and attacking people for wearing trump hats if your definition of scum is gathering together in a group to hurt people less welloff than yourself what does that make the overwhelmingly white collegiate uppermiddle class portland protesters destroying the working classs property for sg
socialism,removed,like any of those protesters know how to use a gun
socialism,removed,on the sidebar right now lenins quote is politics begin where the masses are not where there are thousands but where there are millions do the millions of working class and underemployed people who flipped states for trump not exist in your world wisconsin michigan ohio pennsylvaniathese were not the elite northeast or the drippingwithmoney silicon west they werent the richest milehigh place to live in america colorado if you were really concerned about the masses perhaps you should have listened to them like the trump campaign did hell never deliver what they want but he was the one who listened to their anger now all the armchair socialist elite are unhappy that the uneducated masses got their way how ironic
socialism,removed,this isnt actually a socialism sub its a pretentious hipster social justice wah capitalism sub
socialism,removed,people like you are the reason people who might otherwise have come to socialism to better their societies are instead led astray by capitalist philosophies that at least do them the service of pretending to respect them go fuck yourself
socialism,removed,ben shapiro has been entirely btfo this entire election and his predictions are now as valuable as a pebble stick in my shoe sour grapes from a man who started his own splinter business just to have his whole analysis be wrong while he continues to advertise sheets
socialism,removed,if liberal butthurtness could be converted to energy america would be selfsustaining
socialism,removed,because the children on this sub cant handle incrementalism and when i say children im talking about the adults here too

socialism,removed,trump has plenty of plans and they will go into effect so lmao at your mudslime ass donaldjtrumpcompositions
socialism,removed,to many people voting is the only means the current system has for individuals to represent themselves in government the parties havent opened themselves up to management by the people so protests dont seem ineffective in convincing the elites to go against their own self interest i dont have disdain for these individuals theyre an opportunity and theyre certainly easier to deal with than the radical progressives who want to demolish the dnc or republicans who want to demolish government
socialism,removed,kaepernick is an arrogant idiot an ignoramus i was with him on the protest but his decision not to vote is idiotic he clearly does not have any sense of perspective whatsoever im not going to go into it ive explained this literally times and im getting tired of it the problem is people listen to athletes and other people who dont have a smart opinion or a nuanced one everyone has a damn opinion when it comes to politics but people who actually do understand it get drowned out
socialism,removed,he should have left the presidential section blank and voted on the countless other things california had on the ballot hes a damn fool
socialism,removed,fuck you
socialism,removed,or you could just organize and build a grassroots movement that works with the dnc who at the very least wont work against your end goals honestly saying you want to trash the system is the most retarded thing ever
socialism,removed,hillary has a proven track record of denigrating and bombing people of color trump simply promises to do it i mean yeah but she isnt bombing them because theyre of color theyre targeted attacks against terroristsmilitants what trump is promising to do is broad brushstroke discrimination against entire racesethnicitiescountries out of fear that they might be terroristsmilitants dont get me wrong death is worse than deportation and blocked immigration but id argue that a death sentence against somebody thats guilty is better than extraditing enormous groups of innocent people
socialism,removed,liberals are so brainwashed into believing that the only way to change things for the better is to vote in bourgeois elections id say im independent with a heavy left lean so hopefully you can help me make some sense of choosing not to vote my argument by not voting are you actually having an affect of any kind considering that our countrys policies are only put in place through the act of voting whether that be voting on the individual propositions or voting people into offices where they affect legislation isnt the only way to eventually get to your desired outcome to vote for the option that is closest to your goal doesnt not voting accomplish absolutely nothing i can kind of see why kaepernick might not vote and that be a good thinghes in the spotlight and he can not vote in protest and that can speak to a lot of people but why would i joeeveryman think that not voting is a better option than voting after reading this it sounds a little condescending which isnt my goal here im genuinely interested in your viewpoints if you care to share
socialism,removed,have a source for that i know that civilians have been killed but does the number actually outweigh the terroristsmilitants granted no civilians should be killed but thats war trump has stated hed turn the whole middle east to glass you think hed stop these wars i dont i dont like hillary either but i think if you consider ones intent vs the other trump is worse for people of color judging by the split for black people the split for hispanics and split for asians in favor of hillary it seems pretty clear that people of color preferred hillary over trump
socialism,removed,max stirner
socialism,removed,i dont see how not voting gets your closer to your goals
socialism,removed,so how you are going to make america socialist by not voting
socialism,removed,are all safety nets in socialism above poverty do they include unwanted demographics like white cis men
socialism,removed,because reddit first and foremost panders to peoples most kneejerkey preconceived notions about things and places that are different
socialism,removed,so start a company and become your own boss
socialism,removed,the fact that it had to be condensed only strengthens the argument that it doesnt make sense this dude is on the list there are other many much more influential contributions that should be there instead and again youre just repeating what poblacht already said to which ive already replied ofc i know what position he puts forward never been to a sp meeting but ive talked to your boring fulltimers and read your dull articles i know what the orthotrot stance on the national question and ireland is stop pretending this hadden guy was some individual theorist and not just applying what ted grant had already produced before him his work is only published by cwi press the fact that ive never heard of him is as much of a testament to my ignorance as the fact ive never heard of whatever expert the swp has on ireland
socialism,removed,great message but what does this have to do with socialism
socialism,removed,i feel bad that i laughed seeing those deadpan expressions in some of thost positions
socialism,removed,ctr please go were not obligated to vote for your neoliberal warmonger of a candidate if the dems wanted leftist votes they should have nominated at least sanders if not an actual leftist
socialism,removed,none of these photos even sort of depicts what turner was convicted of the people here have no idea what he actually did do you
socialism,removed,to me trans stuff and other identity politics are merely inconsequential side objectives get out then we dont need or want people like you

socialism,removed,to me the us situation doesnt matter what is socialism without international solidarity
socialism,removed,you could quit your job and get a different one
socialism,removed,the problem is we dont have the time the political bourgeoisie on the right are clutching power tightly usually through undemocratic means like gerrymandering and voter suppression and are gonna stay that way because theyve managed to convince their constituency complete lies about leftism creating class conscience should be the goal because that will enrage the the far right constituency to vote them out of office at this point the right either exits gracefully or their going to regret going so big on the second amendment
socialism,removed,i thank you for the explanation and you taking the time to talk to me however when you end with the goal being no state no class and no money you lost me i wish the world could be like that but that simply cannot and will not happen it will just cycle back to feudalism all over again do you watch the walking dead itd be like that total anarchy no classes no government everyone is free right a communist paradise except small groups all work for the benefit of their own groups and fight with other groups over control of resources itd be the competitiveness of a capitalist society with the danger of the absence of an entity to protect the consumers this is why i am wary to accept an ideology that revolves around the absence of a state call me what you will but i think that government is absolutely necessary for some stuff again thanks for replying
socialism,removed,i dont remember how the usps was horrible until fedex and i also dont know where you get your information on canadian wait times being worse than in the us but i dont think it is from canadians insofar as ive heard the opposite from canadians the usps thing ive just heard from many adults in my life growing up how horrible it was and how slow it was why do you think it got the nickname snail mail and the united states package stealers usps because they were slow and inefficient as for wait times i saw a video of a man named steven stephen whatever crowder with a hidden camera saying he had broken his arm and went from help center to help center in canada trying to get some medical attention it took days if i recall he was canadian right now the two biggest threats to human survival are climate change and nuclear war both brought to us courtesy of capitalism communist china is the largest producer of carbon emissions in the world i also dont see how they are capitalist because the employers only make as much as the government lets them if thats what you think capitalism is then i think youre mistaken other socialist and communist nations are huge exporters of the fossil fuels that bring about climate change i wont disagree that its a threat but it cannot be capitalisms fault as for nuclear war what the government spent money making the nuclear bomb it wasnt some newage tesla in his back yard making hydrogen bombs in the i fail to see how nuclear war is the fault of capitalism those are the only few disagreements i have with your response i thank you for taking the time to explain to me your thoughts
socialism,removed,sanders outside of the neoliberal frame work has no exposure sanders working within the neoliberal framework is not an alternative sanders as an expression of a challenge to the neoliberal framework is the idea here its not socialism but its a clear indication that the working masses know that the current system is failing all of the dejected sanders supporters were rallying behind both biden and michelle obama how out of touch with workers are you
socialism,removed,it seems like you dont even understand what capitalism is im certain i do what do you think the government more accurately the state exists for protecting its citizens its an organ established by the people who own all the worlds wealth to use violence to maintain private property relations which are the fundamental feature of capitalism not the freedom of the market thats kinda how the world works man money power because money corruption i agree with the fact that government forces you to do stuff at gunpoint and im not a big fan of that i think this is pretty hypocritical of you you socialists like to point at countries like the us that are corrupt and say seeee capitalism cannot work because its truly corrupt this is what real capitalism is like then turn around and look at places like venezuela the union of soviet socialist republics china cuba and north korea and go no you got it all wrong they werent true socialists they didnt really do it right socialism in theory goes like this everything works in theory even capitalism stop pretending like theoretical socialism can ever work in the real world just like theoretical capitalism cant you have to disagree with capitalism before you can become a socialist is there an ideology that combines the two cause id be on board for that why should we waste our time trying to convince someone who doesnt even think there needs to be an alternative to capitalism as it is that it can just be fixed in small ways to perfect it when we could be spending out time talking to people who actually recognise that capitalism is fucked but dont know what other options there could be well now youre just being an elitist douchebag why do you think id even come here if i didnt think there needs to be an alternative to capitalism as it is did i get that part right its hard to hear you up on that high horse of yours i recognize that capitalism is flawed thats why im fucking here asking questions thats why my head isnt up my ass telling you guys hehehe socialism is gay and never works something something communism something something national debt capitalism rules and there is no debating it kind of a dickish way to treat someone whos just trying to learn both sides of an argument before really deciding
socialism,removed,thinking that a small elite group of people controlling the economy is capitalism is correct when they are part of the government however it is incorrect lets take a step back from our utopia vr headset for a moment here yeah yeah not real communism i get that a lot in the real world thats what applied communism is really like the government is made up of a ruling elite that hordes literally all of the stuff and everyone else is poor this is fundamentally different than capitalism because of things there is no middle class in applied communism people who are rich in capitalist societies lets take a ceo for example will use their cash to expand their business benefiting more people along the way this is whats known as trickledown economics sorry if that sounded demeaning i responded to a guy earlier who was being kind of a dick and didnt mean to project that onto you
socialism,removed,no i think you may just have social anxiety dont blame capitalism for your mental disorders
socialism,removed,honest question what does womens suffrage have to do with socialism
socialism,removed,i keep getting told that money the state and classes would all be abolished under true socialism this question has nothing to do with socialism in that case
socialism,removed,thats funny i seem to remember a national socialist regime that killed over million people but i guess its capitalism that kills
socialism,removed,weve had those before in dc part of the beauty of a free and open society i would love to see what kind of dissenting posters you are allowed to display in china
socialism,removed,this is all true though capitalism has plenty of flaws too but come at me when capitalism kills or
socialism,removed,and where have you met these ayn randers
socialism,removed,i just interviewed a man whose brother was executed by fidel he was the richest man in cuba his net worth over million
socialism,removed,oh we bat an eye at it because for all the dead it didnt stop the president from pulling out and wasting all those lives when iraq had a chance to become truly free after years of rule under a tyrannical despotic ruler couldnt get a status of forces agreement seriously and what a coincidence that he campaigned on getting us out of iraq not out of japan or germany where we have been for years but out of iraq withdrawal and let them twist in the wind let them go right back to tyranny subjection of women oppression of homosexuals religious extremism i guess they are brown people so why care about them right
socialism,removed,can you deny any of it let me guess its enough just to shove your fingers in your ears and shout not uuuuh im not listening im not listening lalalallalalalalala lol communism is pesant social order used on pesant countries by authoritarian oligarchs communists are trash
socialism,removed,seen it
socialism,removed,are you a capitalist in that you own capital some employ labor infrequently are you a capitalist in that you ideologically support the capitalist mode of production yes
socialism,removed,i will wait to see if this stays the top comment before i take it as the voice of the group assuming it does wow but clear enough
socialism,removed,yeah bro communism is good for everyone
socialism,removed,i agree that debate is useless at least with stangers on reddit another comment did present a position that i could have depated notice that i didnt but ive seen some of the posts elsewhere i get why you might be jaded but i defended many of the bans from here that other ancaps promote as signs closed mindedness while rancap went to hell due to outside intrusion im not sure if there is much i can do to show good faith but hypothetically if someone did come here in good faith and didnt debate because i know it is not what you do here what channel of communication would you recommend i monitor i hope i dont have to settle for russel brand
socialism,removed,socialism and government interference seem to be the only problems facing capitalism
socialism,removed,whataboutism what youre saying doesnt make other kills ok also capitalism doesnt kill usa kill learn the difference communism as a system is designed to kill capitalism doesnt
socialism,removed,funny you should mention molotovs the weapon named by the socalled evil capitalists and used in self defence against imperialistic communist armies
socialism,removed,from an ism standpoint communism socialism fascism and barbarism have killed many more millions than capitalism the facts are there for everyone to see how is it backwards
socialism,removed,fuck those victims bunch of pussies who were stooges for imperialism and capitalism
socialism,removed,cant tell if youre being sarcastic or not but communism hasnt been reached yet by anyone north korea is ridden with poverty and starvation yes a lot like some western nations but perhaps on a larger scale china has no form of wealth distribution again like the west it all goes to the ruling class
socialism,removed,exactly a lot of people traded when they had the choice between socialism and capitalist westgermany even at the risk of their life not because western europe was the holy paradise and utopian fantasyland but because an actual socialist regime is fucking hell
socialism,removed,stalin starved million peasants and kulaks through collectivisation and another million in the holodomor genocide im not justifying churchills starvation of indians but he starved million not million people who opposed stalins regimewere political opponents were sent to the gulags i know criticism of socialism isnt really allowed here but youre spewing lies churchill was nowhere near as bad as stalin
socialism,removed,youre complaining about capitalism causing starvation and completely ruining out the failures of communism collectivisation starved more people than the usa ever has
socialism,removed,most of the bad stuff done by soviet is nato manufactured propaganda are you serious the violent and bloody suppression of the hungarian revolution for example what is your stance on that just nato propaganda holodomor was to blame on bureaucracy and not on soviet itself rsocialism my friends akin to holocaust deniers who proclaim that people in concentration camps just died because the allies bombed the supply trains i hope you are a troll
socialism,removed,there are only a few communist parties on the earth that have any power right now they are failing they cant support their people lol
socialism,removed,but isnt that all true china is literally going on their populace and i dont recall any communist regime that hasnt relegated its citizens to mindless extensions of the government agenda
socialism,removed,have you read the gulag archipelago in your nine years
socialism,removed,whoa there fellas socialism is not communism communism is far more extreme communism is also a shit system you guys are being too extreme
socialism,removed,humans kill your argument doesnt work at any level mom johnny why did you kick timmy johnny because mark was kicking him too youre johnny
socialism,removed,is there anything factually inaccurate or are you just angry because facts are being used to disprove a standpoint you arrived at using no facts at all
socialism,removed,to be fair the few people i have met who lived under communist governments did not like it
socialism,removed,only add a couple of zeroes and ill be happy
socialism,removed,socialism will never work in a multiracial environment especially in an environment that has a high population of races that have a low average iq
socialism,removed,two wrongs dont make a right
socialism,removed,is the stuff up here not accurate though httpsenmwikipediaorgwikimasskillingsundercommunistregimes the highest death tolls that have been documented in communist states occurred in the soviet union under joseph stalin in the peoples republic of china under mao zedong and in cambodia under the khmer rouge the estimates of the number of noncombatants killed by these three regimes alone range from a low of million to a high of million can you point to a socialist or capitalist country which can claim these numbers of noncombatant killings
socialism,removed,on the extreme right of the historical political spectrum stand the american founding fathers on the extreme left lie million dead people
socialism,removed,are you straight up denying that these things happened or claiming the death tolls are inaccurate what are your sources for those assertions httpsenwikipediaorgwikimasskillingsundercommunistregimessovietunion httpsenwikipediaorgwikiredterror httpsenwikipediaorgwikigreatpurge httpsenwikipediaorgwikistalinistrepressionsinmongolia im legitimately asking here
socialism,removed,im not him but ill tell you that my country doesnt have to install suicide nets under my office building to keep workers from killing themselves
socialism,removed,shouldhavebeentrotsky
socialism,removed,i somehow doubt that and i thankyou for responding in bad faith as its at least saved me from the effort of typing up another response with the idea that positive discourse could happen
socialism,removed,i dont think so did you mean to reply to me i think you meant to reply to someone else
socialism,removed,the good thing about socialism in the west is that those ignorant enough to believe in it arent intelligent or talented enough to be democratically elected
socialism,removed,love it truth
socialism,removed,you have seconds to name a successful example of communism or socialism
socialism,removed,the war began with osama forming alqaeda with the resources of leading muslim countries in the late early muslims were fighting a war of attrition long before the us attacked anyone opened the worlds eyes and the west stated fighting back years later amid muslim extremist attacks happening on a daily basis you still ask these questions shame on you everything happens for a reason and iraq is a war zone because of unchecked radical islam not the us it was a warzone before the first us invader stepped foot there
socialism,removed,straw man argument id prefer to hear you counter the statement this picture is making with something other than america has done worse you havent defended socialism at all
socialism,removed,i find it hilarious that someone is this mad on the internet maybe you should go read a book
socialism,removed,if posting makes you physically shake with anger i think you should definitely do something else for recreation that cant be healthy
socialism,removed,this is so madeup and ridiculous lol its pretty obvious you just constantly make new accounts and argue with people online i hope you know everyone else has been on the internet before today
socialism,removed,😎
socialism,removed,sigh you didnt think this through that hard huh islamic terror and other acts considered terrorism are thus labeled because they have a statistical consistency committed under a political or religious ideal if youre able to engage in discourse with a person of the farright without insulting them youll realize that the majority of them do not operate on religious zeal calling white supremacists atrocities terrorism has become mainstream when an extremist commits a mass murder we sometimes call it terrorism the exact definition of extremist is a person who holds extreme or fanatical political or religious views especially one who resorts to or advocates extreme action the definition of terrorism is the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims in the modern world we always call an extremist attack terrorism why do groups like the socalled islamic state get to have a special qualifier like jihadist applied to them to differentiate them from the ideology of the far right much like believers of the left believers of right are also given a special qualifier that of fascist regardless of specific policy or belief all those on the right of the spectrum are labeled nazi or fascist automatically the farright does have a label and it is fascist pig we shouldnt be allowing that so what shall we call the islamic state instead i believe that we can create more cohesive action against these dangerous ideologies which are really just different brands of a single ideology by referring to them all as farright extremist terrorism we all know that thats what it is so lets make a point of it socialism and communism are the two most murderous ideologies in the history of man the modern radical left also commits more violent acts against the community and country than the radical right we all know that thats what it is so lets make a point of it a point of what establishing something already established by the way on your title lets resist the far rights control of political discourse it is the left who more actively attack free speech the right seems to be the defending force of free speech and political discourse
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,youre right communism is such a good idea the russian people lived so well under the soviet union im sure one day youll grow up
socialism,removed,mommy and daddy never hugged you fucking weirdos did they reading through some of this thought garbage i cant say i blame them
socialism,removed,oh man youre right things were httpsenwikipediaorgwikigreatleapforward when china was communist the selective thinking in this sub is staggering maybe they didnt want suicide nets because it they were busy httpsenwikipediaorgwikigreatleapforwarddeathsbyviolence themselves i mean the workers were probably too weak to even climb to the top of a communist factor to jump off considering httpsenwikipediaorgwikigreatchinesefamine
socialism,removed,hippies are decent people i know hippies you freaks are no hippies
socialism,removed,the fact that these adverts are appearing at all shows us that the capitalist class believes socialism is threatening their privilege like the privilege to buy bread without needing a wheelbarrow full of venezuelan bolivars
socialism,removed,oh okay then lord knows weve never heard that song and dance before gotta be for real this time
socialism,removed,lol yeah dying from poverty and war are totally the same thing
socialism,removed,gulag
socialism,removed,yea in the so the british were the capitalists ruling india right pretty sure they purposefully starved some of them to maintain rule also india at the time wasnt capatilist as they operated under a cast system meaning if you were born to a servant you will always be a servant or no hope for a better life pretty much no matter how hard you work today india operates under capitalism and have one of the fastest growing economies expected to pass the uk this year any proof socialism works from the century cause venezuelan fisherman have resorted to piracy aiken to fucking somalia
socialism,removed,but werent those books created and published only under a capitalist system
socialism,removed,trump wants to reduce coal regulations which will help the businesses
socialism,removed,you people support socialism and its dogshit ideas because you know you cant contribute to a meritocracy
socialism,removed,yes your parents must be very distraught at the silly phase you people are going through
socialism,removed,let me argue against this for a bit capitalism is for all intends and purposes the basic human condition it is the respected result when you take a social species give them intelligence and leave them with an abundance of resources it is fueled partly by the inherent competitive nature of humans and partly by a need for oversatiation of the basic needs it is darwinian on a social scale and will through attrition inhibit or kill its weaker elements it does this without any human interference and is for all intends of purposes nature going its course in a social species this darwinian element gives it completely flexibility capitalism will persist irrespective of the conditions it exists in and yes even under communistic rule it simply cannot be repressed completely since its a projection of human nature man does not merely want to live they want to thrive they do not merely want to be on par with their neighbour they want to brag to their nature the single most destructive instinct in humans is the sickly instinct to feed ones own ego and it gives way to infinite greed there is no upper limit to how high ones ego can get while there is a limit to the realistic usability of capital by a single individual however killing in pursuit of greed or satisfying ones own ego cant be counted to deaths caused by capitalism aside from the fact that kills by these motivations also happen within a communistic society when we say deaths caused by communism or deaths caused by capitalism it refers to them as a system how much did the system actively cause through the establishment maintenance preservation and expansion of it for capitalism this number is untill the birth of communism after all to kill people for the establishment maintenance preservation or expansion of capitalism in a vaccuum is completely absurd it does all these things by itself without any intentional input using only the nature of its compartments as its fuel deaths caused in it are deaths caused by the human condition in most deaths caused by it are caused due to the social darwinism that exists in it now you might protest to this but let me ask you this under what environmental circumstances that isnt a human revolutionary force would capitalism fall and what system would automatically replace it what is the default if capitalism isnt it capitalism started to fill its body count during the cold war when it actually had to kill in order to preserve to it communism is actually responsible for a huge amount of deaths it it did so explicitly for its own establishment since it isnt a natural state of being and had to be brought on by a political movement its expansion causing quite a lot of civil wars but most of them are caused by its maintenance and preservation you see what communism lack is the thing that made capitalism simultaniously so detestable and so effective darwinism rooting out weak links when the system is put under stress happens automatically without anyones intent or aid within a capitalistic society but very point of communism and socialism in general for that matter is to shield the community from darwinism this has as a result that when certain parts of it are getting fucked up beyond repair the only option a communistic regime has other than letting the part slowly destroy the whole of it to counter it is through cutting them loose from system or otherwise neutralize the threat if you keep that region equal to yours it will pull both regions down to a degree that isnt viable or productive so you either play darwin yourself and allow the weak link to be destroyed or you start killing people off until the region is viable again another element is that any capitalistic part of a communistic society that isnt the capitalistic unit the state is relative to other states simply cant exist the existance of things like a black market is a direct threat to the system so you destroy it and the people keeping it running but now you cause collateral damage because the people you killed had families and friends and now you are in a bad light and the chance for revolt to the government due to its brutal response is growing so as an act of selfpreservation which is in no way exclusive to communistic regimes pretty much every form of governance has been guilty of this at some point in time it must now suppress any discontent elements this is of course a completely selfdestructive method since it will create and ever increasing amount of dissenters and consequently victims this is also the reason why practically any form of governance collapses eventually it always reaches a point of critical mass which results in a phase of damage control and eventually results in the complete reform or disintegration of the system
socialism,removed,its true though you can say but capitalism kills more or whatever but it doesnt change facts
socialism,removed,and thats why stalin was involved in approximately million deaths in the ussr socialismkills
socialism,removed,but that was government action not free market behavior
socialism,removed,the truth that socialism is a shouldbedead philosophy that has failed time after time after time over the past two centuries still hasnt set in for you
socialism,removed,there are definitely examples of what you are asking for but the examples of socialist and communist governments persecuting their citizens is so much more prevalent that it drowns it out socialism and communism are both fancy terms for slavery to the state you are all blinded to the truth of the foolish doctrines you follow for various reasons but blind you remain socialism and communism are objectively antihuman and antiindividual wake up and realize that the most brutal governments in modern times have all been some form or socialistcommunist nightmare
socialism,removed,see this proves socialist superiority socialism hasnt been around nearly as long as capitalism and it has killed way more people
socialism,removed,doesnt look like backwards bullshit to me
socialism,removed,if i am a socialist who is also a nationalist does that make me a nazi
socialism,removed,no need to pick sides we can blame both oppressive ideologies
socialism,removed,from my estimation the basis of semitic religions is well understood the ruthless commandeering nature of man and men the basis for capitalism is hedonism
socialism,removed,fascism goes handinglove with socialism nearly every socialist government has burdened businesses with their policies but have done it so that when it fails they can blame the businesses for the problems see venezuela
socialism,removed,op is delusional
socialism,removed,learn about how venezuela is currently doing for example lol
socialism,removed,is it possible you call it a social democracy because a true socialist nation always becomes something else as it fails as in was venezuela socialist in the and perhaps
socialism,removed,uhh i think youre looking for rfullcommunism
socialism,removed,mmmh hmmm maybe cuba cubas cool right
socialism,removed,its funny how rsocialism uses hitler to make a point ignoring the fact that nazi germany was socialist during the war
socialism,removed,everyone deserves a living wage define how much should a no experience high school burger flipper make
socialism,removed,when you find out the nazis where socialist leleleleelelelelelelelelel
socialism,removed,then go do it if you dont need a jobs creator certainly you dont need someone to tell you to go rebuild detroit
socialism,removed,the cia is the disinformation arm o the militarycorporateglobalistgovernment complex and has been since its inception this is an organization that has infiltrated our media this is the organization that sold us on the wmds oh but suddenly were supposed to believe them uh huh
socialism,removed,vomit inducing liberal trash
socialism,removed,pls unban
socialism,removed,i would argue that your point about the ussr and soviet style communism being the driving force behind the gains made in the century is wrong im going to be that cunt id say its more the solidarity felt in the aftermath of and the great depression were more impactful than the effect of the soviet union whilst the impact of the soviet union is utterly undeniable i think the consensus policies of the and had a greater influence from the aftermath of these disasters then any reflecting upon the soviet union coupled with the growth of a wealthy industrial skilled working class who didnt have places like china india other parts of asia and robotics to undercut them with cheaper produce furthermore the drive for workers rights began before the russian revolution at least in britain with the liberal party that is where the influence of marx amongst others becomes much clearer in highlighting the ills of the system i just personally dont think you can attribute the gains of workers in the century to the russian revolution please feel free to disputes this and prove me wrong
socialism,removed,can i say dick is that ok or bellend or shall is use gender neutral insults like arsehole is wanker ok or really are you just nitpicking about the etymological route of a word that has changed with common use from referring to vaginas into a general insult can i say fuck knobhead
socialism,removed,logic is fascist
socialism,removed,i agree entirely im not a feminist myself but at least far left feminists have some sense liberal feminists are just retarded privileged sexists the draft is a fucked up institution in any country especially in an imperialist country no way am i giving my life for americas wars just to get some company richer
socialism,removed,fascists arewere socialists this was the case in fascist italy and is still the case now
socialism,removed,your position sounds an awful lot like thoughtcontrol to me mussolini would be proud its insane how socialists can spew this kind of orwellian crap oblivious to the hypocrisy of it all
socialism,removed,black lives dont matter
socialism,removed,just a heads up leftists need to routinely dig up irrelevant articles from the past and disguise them as news because reality is somewhat inconvenient
socialism,removed,maybe you should stop downvoting and telling people to gtfo when they are seeking an honest confrontation and exchange of ideas it makes you look like a weak tumblercore leftie
socialism,removed,you do realise that the britain first was fabricated by a labour mp because you seem to be attacking a strawman murder isnt ok but neither were the hateful policies people like cox were imposing on their constituents most of whom never voted for her as for your pathetic rationalisations for censorship and thoughtcontrol take a look in the mirror you wonder who the real fascists are its the same people they always were the socialists the utopians the socialengineers people like you are those who pave the road to hell with good intentions
socialism,removed,all leftists believe in violence there is no leftism without violence legislation must be passed to curb free speech and voluntary trade capitalism to discriminate arbitrarily against certain demographics seen to be privileged to undermine free business practice by enforcing wage and price controls and to resist this legislation results in violent force against the perpatrator
socialism,removed,lol

socialism,removed,surfing thedonald isnt getting me hard enough where can i start a gofundme account for this hero guise
socialism,removed,ahh youre right million americans living in poverty is inconvenient to the narrative straw man argument over billion people worldwide living on less than a day is inconvenient to the narrative the truth is inconvenient to you which is why you have to dig up this statistic from the past youre spreading bullshit to push your leftist agenda million children dying because they lack immunizations is inconvenient to the narrative im not sure what qualifies as children in that statistic so i dont know if thats true or not no i think reality is actually very consistent with our narrative and that youre delusional i think you place your delusions above reality
socialism,removed,guess he had it coming then would you describe his opinion as problematic or triggering or a combination of the two people like you are a disgrace to socialism
socialism,removed,i can confirm that this discord is excellent
socialism,removed,i dont identify as feminist because third wave first world feminism no longer follows the definition of feminism feminism is now a movement of hypocrisy deceit discrimination and injustice i dont believe women are oppressed any more than men in the first world its hard to measure men are advantaged in some areas women in others however feminists completely ignore all problems men have and call you sexist for pointing them out even if just with bare statistics they leave male victims of rape domestic violence and discrimination to burn and dont even acknowledge that there are lots of male victims out there i agree with what feminism is supposed to stand for but i realize that that movement is lost to privilege and ignorance i am a humanist i believe in equality
socialism,removed,more like no blind agreement no right to speak because you dont really care how much someone has studied an issue or knows about it if they dont agree with you on it they may not speak
socialism,removed,please dont use ltrlly or rltd terms because i was blld for being lltrt when i strggld to read at a yng age thank you
socialism,removed,dont be a dick
socialism,removed,oh fuck off the point was to post it as something to criticize nobody made you read anything reactionary shit gets posted for criticism and discussion all the damn time
socialism,removed,nice glad she killed all those national socialists
socialism,removed,something that has been noted by a good number of people is that he seems to be more prone to outlandish stupid things when the media has something that could hurt him
socialism,removed,you can ask your manager for help thats what hes there for
socialism,removed,jesus christ youre literally censoring the words stupid and dumb what the fuck is wrong with you retards
socialism,removed,i just subscribed a day or two ago and really wanted to unsubscribe when i saw the sjw nonsense being thrown around i will stick around for a bithopefully we move past this and can talk about real problems
socialism,removed,defending the usage of slurs is offense to those who are dehumanized by them so if i say that me and my girlfriends shouldnt be allowed to use sexist slurs in a calm friendly environment for fun because we are dehumanizing one another when my doctor says he wants to talk to me about my bipolar problems he is dehumanizing to me i have no opinion on the thread in general but please stop just saying wrong things in anger context matters in word usage you cant just deny fact like that
socialism,removed,when i was in the discord chat i was a chat mod till i questioned wither stid should be considered a slur i was then demoded put in a role called the self crit chair roles change the color of your username originally we just had them for tendencies and as jokes till they decided to do this weird public shaming thing then a few of the mods pointed out i was in it to the rest of the chat and started deriding me as a piece of shit around the time i was being somewhat open with some issues i was having with being in a bit of a depression yet the people in question still chose to bully a person who was having to be frank suicidal thoughts for disagreeing with them months later i was banned for being depressed so much for consistency in regards to ableism i guess

socialism,removed,according to the ada im disabled according to progressiveleft ideology im also a genderqueer poc that being said this sub is a joke its not about political socialism its just an sjw circle jerk if capitalism is so great why arent i rich and famous huehue dae privilege oppression buzzword everything is a slur against me personally im tired of seeing these retarded posts on rall ban me
socialism,removed,these mod rules are so bad doubleplusungood it becomes impossible to criticize any idea as unintelligent without disparaging unintelligent people
socialism,removed,fuck you and your dumbass version of feminism
socialism,removed,its not that i think theyre dumb and getting scammed by that i mean like give all their money away to televangelists or get pulled in by one of those obviously a majority of people would deal with basic income just fine but there is a minority for whom i feel taking away restrictions on certain welfare programs would hurt
socialism,removed,this is all getting far too confusing im sending all of us to gulag
socialism,removed,good invigorating discussions about feminism ahahahahahahahahahahahaha
socialism,removed,as someone interested in socialist discussion and who just found out about this sub today i have to admit i find these kind of languagepolicing rules offputting and extremely distracting
socialism,removed,you may still quote previous leaders we just ask that you censor the language included in them preferably using dashes so as to not mess up the formatting
socialism,removed,its my honest opinion that the sub cant continue with any sort of policy restricting speech like that im no fan of ableism and im all for rules against it but words like stpid idot lcy or idtic arent slurs theyre used in everyday common language and while they arent the most constructive thing in the world the only people who deem them offensive are people who have no disabilities whatsoever this kind of language censorship reinforces the view that the left are antifree speech
socialism,removed,my only problem with this rule is basically that if you dont use iditic to e g describe one of trumps policies and instead use unintelligent or not well thought through it sounds pretentious and basically enforces the pretentious leftist stereotype i had hoped for the words dmb iditic and stpid to stay while all the others would be banned it is important for verbal oppression to be condemned as much as physical but those words have pretty much lost their meaning but alas i agree with the idea of the policy and do my best to abide by its rules because i understand the reason why it is right many people of both camps pissed me off in the past few days like a certain guy who called me a fucking bigot fuck on the noableism side and many socialists who wanted a complete repeal of the ban and i would love to see solidarity and love return in our ranks
socialism,removed,this is ridiculous this is taking nitpicking and oversensitivity to an unbelievable level now i agree certain words should absolutely be avoided such as rtard atistic and so forth those are legitimately offensive for example ive had cancer i now have scars heart problems and my hair is thin and balding even though im only my life is relatively difficult because of my medical issues so i get upset if someone calls something cancer or aids to describe it as bad because i think its actually a mean thing to say my friends know this and have stopped since then to accommodate me but words like stpid idotic and even insne are not jabs at actually mentally disabled individuals who we stand in absolute and unwavering solidarity with all this is doing is putting new users and new comrades off to us not to mention that thousands of us have complained and all you do despite believing in direct democracy is say oh we hear you but were still gonna do what we want while explaining why were not listening to you instead of just not listening its a distracting policy and makes all of us look bad there is an extremely noticeable line between saying wow thats pretty dmb and wow all disabled people should be executed obviously the latter should be dealt with not the former on behalf of everyone who is extremely annoyed and angry at this obstruction of democracy as well as obstruction of normal conversation and debate we ask you to remove this ridiculous policy
socialism,removed,here is a poll asking whether certain words should be considered hate speech hopefully it will give our community a change to actually have a democratic voice in this policy
socialism,removed,i dont think you guys realize how absurd this all is and how many people youre going to dissuade from the cause with this language policing nonsense taking punitive action against slurs and obvious attacks against people is one thing but for common simple idioms like turn a blind eye to that is just pure ridiculousness all your doing is needlessly alienating people we should be trying to reach out to tldr this is fucking stupid
socialism,removed,with all due respect the white male demographic is what carried the us elections the question is does the call for organizing made earlier about what the movement should do want to exclude these people are they all just a monolithic entity of the lazy and privileged whose concerns are utterly invalid because they seem to have prejudices this sounds like the hillary apologism from liberals after the election
socialism,removed,i dont know if this is the right place for this but i was kicked from the chat for not agreeing that stid is a slur despite promising not to actually use the word because its not a word i generally use anyway a policy ostensibly made to make neurodivergent people feel more welcome resulted in somebody with aspergers being kicked because they disagree about the semantics of a word they didnt use anyway
socialism,removed,i think this policy totally missed the mark as everyone else has said words like retrd are not alright and the users who use it should get banned that being said it seems like the moderators have failed to understand that banning people regardless of the context of their sentence is authoritarian and wont change anything it will just get people upset and turned off to this subreddit and maybe socialism as a whole furthermore it gives reactionaries exactly what they want disillusioned liberals who are at a time where their ideology might be shattered are going to be vulnerable to reactionaries arguments about socialism if we act in this authoritarian manner being that the mods have failed to understand this once again what do users of rsocialism do i think its time we demand the election of our moderators in the spirit of radical democracy lets do something that no other subreddit does it will ensure that the people who represent and overlook our sub act in the users best interests moderators like any leaders with unchecked authority tend to lose sight of their constituency as they arent reliant on them to rule lets prove the reactionaries wrong this time lets vote for our moderators and maybe have referendums on large sweeping policy action we wouldnt accept a dictator over the means of production so why should we accept one over the means of policy just a proposal i dont know exactly how this would be achieved but i think we must for the sake of our subreddit and the conception of socialism on reddit succeed
socialism,removed,why are all the comments that express disagreement with this rule and the moderators being removed
socialism,removed,your occiput seems to be a tad thick
socialism,removed,it seems like people diagree with the ideas that a certain words that are being banned are ableist and b censorship is a good method of enacting cultural change and promoting inclusion both in this instance and in a broader sense the arguments for the policy generally tend to assume that these positions are true dismiss arguments to the contrary out of hand and redirect the conversation taking their views as a given this may be one possible reason for the downvotes likely among others
socialism,removed,rempiredidnothingwrong
socialism,removed,social political cultural sexual or linguistic i tell my girlfriend this all the time but she still wont put her finger in my butt
socialism,removed,such a vote could easily be contaminated by liberals reactionaries and brocialists furthermore this subreddit is not a democracy and it should not seek to become one it is irrelevant how the community feels what matters is what is the right thing to do and who decides what the right thing is to do the mods this rule while wellintentioned is just going to make it ever harder for new people to get into socialism if someone comes in here and types a phrase like stupid and gets a ban for it why would they ever come back the goal of this subreddit is to promote socialist ideas and making it ridiculously hard for new people to join without getting banned is exactly the wrong tactic to pursue you seem to be advocating a fullscale change in the language the entire community uses maybe thats possible for us but no newcomer to the subreddit is going to be uptodate with all these silly rules yeah we can by force of moderation oblige the community to change but why would we this was never a real problem
socialism,removed,we should not seek the favor of the liberals brocialists and revoluzzers if theyre not willing to make small changes in their word choice then theyre not people we want in our movement deleting peoples comments or accusing them of being shitlords wont change their behavior this stinks of the neoleftist puritan beliefs which honestly contains quite the classist undertones working class people arent born socialists and due to the unequal distribution of time able to commit gaining political knowledge alot of them arent as knowledgeable about the subjects in question material conditions may force working class into taking pseudoreactionary positions both men women and other and of all colors however the solution to that problem cant be calling them shitlords brocialists liberals or other slurs directed against people you disagree with when in reality material conditions is behind it all if we actually want to change peoples minds and create a mass movement we have to educate people instead of being assholes secondly the mod team has yet again shown themselves being completely uninterested in the majority opinion and has honestly acted as the authoritarian bully we so often agitate against power corrupts everyone but the hypocrisy shown by the moderators in recent time really is something special the moderators control a sort of artificial monopoly on violence they have no interest in the opinion of the majority transparency and let their own petty fights get in the way of the users interests concerning the drama around sts and sls the moderators acting like a vanguard of sorts only representing their own elitist views and being able to implement it as they like without even speaking to the community undoubtedly creates a monopoly of violence in the bourgeoisie sense to me as an anarchist and anticapitalist this makes this sub virtually unusable i cant justify for myself using this instrument of bourgeoisie hierarchy if serious changes in internal democracy and transparency no the things metioned arent changes it´s saying yeah we fucked up sorry but virtually nothing will actually change i have no option but to stop using this subreddit i sincerely hope that things will change and for the love of god moderators question your own actions and selftrial
socialism,removed,shame this sub wants to erase valuable information erasure of information and censorship puts them in bad company im all for respecting people of all abilities but now we cant even discuss something that is new for many people utterly shameful
socialism,removed,some alternatives to that word baseless untrue unfounded wrong full of holes ineffective nugatory these words are much better substitutes and dont have the same ableist connotation past or present
socialism,removed,its too fauxbritish nbsp there seems to be little indication outside of empty promises that the mods are actually going to make good on their promises to act in good faith about the current ableism rules were still getting people banned for extended periods for using words and phrases common to the english language and were still seeing the suppression of discussion on the legitimacypracticality of the rules in question trying to reinvent the english language to tiptoe around dictatorial moderation standards ultimately solves nothing the structure of how our board is managed and governed needs to be directly challenged to see change even if the resulting conclusion of the peoples will is much the same as it is now
socialism,removed,while im entirely in favor of the world over adopting the lexicon of ireland as it would be the most entertaining transpiration of events ive yet witnessed i unfortunately have no idea which words you among others are trying to replace this xword approach to reference is entirely inconvenient and also risks the very purpose of reference being to accurately serve as a pointer to something else slurs are not limited to the first letter in their lingual sequence this will be a persistent problem especially as im sure over time more words will be blacklisted if the mods wants to convert people to a new lexicon they would be fools not to allow the use of the slur contextually with good faith to aid the transmission of ideas
socialism,removed,yeah no thought policing is part of the reason why the left has lost both my vote and my time ive stayed away from left leaning subs on reddit for this reason but a coworker showed what was going on and i just thought id chime in
socialism,removed,thats retarded
socialism,removed,what if we all support and encourage each other to transition more women and fewer men all in the same move

socialism,removed,vicious sectarian infighting what the fuck did you just say about me i hope you like the gulag kiddo
socialism,removed,i have to downvote for the title
socialism,removed,go to liveleak and search for set on fire and you will see the difference
socialism,removed,someone was literally set on fire and youre here complaining that she wasnt set on fire enough for it to really be considered set of fire the fuck
socialism,removed,you seriously cant see how the title is sensationalized and misleading the title is taken directly from the clickbait headline of a tabloid
socialism,removed,strawman literally no one taking issue with the title is saying a hate crime didnt happen
socialism,removed,trots are insufferable this article only addresses what is trotskyism insofar as it shows how annoyingly antiussr trotskyists are
socialism,removed,fucking trots dont know how to live in reality if you honestly do not understand that set on fire has connotations beyond its literal definition youre incredibly dense
socialism,removed,i was actually very concerned at first i thought she was set aflame at first like flames blazing then i realised her blouse was slightly charred and i was relieved that it wasnt worse its a disgusting thing to do no doubt but her life was in no way threatened like the title led me to believe this was a sensationalist title kids set each others on fire with lighters all the time where im from as a joke
socialism,removed,im complaining about the title making me think someone was burned alive which got my heart racing and filled me with dread yes it was a hate crime but they let us think it was a gruesome murder to get more clicks
socialism,removed,as a kurd i laugh when i see when lots of people get angry because of the designation of the woman she is for sure a humankind warrior and among the bravest human beings on earth however calling her angelina jolie isnt as bad as you can think if she werent entitled so nobody would have certainly heard of her we kurdish people have always been ignored not as much as balutch or tamil though nonetheless were now clearly in the heat of action but were still underscored by traditional medias thus having a european star as a pseudo gets kurds quite happy we know that those very medias will talk about us and at least angelina jolie went to kurdistan to give it money for humanitarian help anyway may her fellows be saved and may isis turkey saudi arabia qatar and the capitalist pigs who send them money see how bullets taste when aimed at the butchers
socialism,removed,yeah they dont want to end up like north korea

socialism,removed,yes i agree nazis are terrible people but every human has the right to speak their mind no matter how much of an asshole they are and you cant just punch them for it i dont agree with what was done to him you dont combat words with violence
socialism,removed,does working to death executing in its own special camps and starving out millions count as a reason to go around punching communists
socialism,removed,exactly and im tempted to make the comparison that the op could have shown a soviet gulag with this is why its ok to punch a communist
socialism,removed,its the internet grow a pair
socialism,removed,wasnt hitler a socialist though
socialism,removed,i never understand this sub isnt venezuela socialist
socialism,removed,countering the expression of beliefs with violence is fascism if you punch someone in the face for not believing as you do you are the fascist you are the nazi
socialism,removed,youre on rsocialism this place is as disgusting and violent as any sub thats ever existed on reddit thats pretty on par with socialism though
socialism,removed,i dont care what you call it i dont care if its semantically the correct term using violence to suppress the free exchange of ideas is unjust harmful and oppressive what term should i use in the future to prevent internet scholars from pushing up their glasses at me
socialism,removed,promoting punching people in the face because of their views over a picture commemorating the holocaust you people disgust me
socialism,removed,does the word gulag ring a bell for anyone here anyone how about great purge
socialism,removed,i wouldnt recommend wasting your time trying to understand insanity or the mind of a sociopath thats how you describe those people

socialism,removed,listen the whole point of my comments was to stress tbe danger of censorship and stress that freedom of speech is a basic human right
socialism,removed,i know and punching people you call a nazi in the street is only going to make their movement stronger they arent going to say welp got punched by a liberal i guess theyre right

socialism,removed,you mean national socialist
socialism,removed,it is not okay to punch anyone
socialism,removed,oh so youre advocating violence against these guys not actual nazis since theyre not around anymore thats pretty much what i thought
socialism,removed,many nazis fought for a better future for their kids many didnt know what their government did many cried and even begged forgiveness when they saw what happened in those camps do not punch those who are ignorant but reach out to them and share your knowledge with them and try to see the world from their perspective only by opening up share experiences knowledge and kindness can we leave the horrid ways behind to understand is the first step to help someone change be better than they are and hope that they will become better than you
socialism,removed,oh fuck off with that shit

socialism,removed,not reading history and seeing how miserably socialism always fails when you run out of money
socialism,removed,trying a little too hard to be edgy
socialism,removed,its weird to me to see leftists getting all gungho about interventionism when as soon as was over that same moral justification was used to support anticommunist actions the same is true of captain america and indiana jones people post them as examples of good nazipunching but both of them inevitably got pushed towards anticommunism although jones didnt do it until way after the cold war was already over its also weird to see people equating antiinterventionism with allowing nazis to win when at this point in history interventionism is primarily about american imperialism
socialism,removed,why would i give a shit about people halfway across the goddamn world they dont owe me shit and i dont owe them shit
socialism,removed,i appreciate what youre trying to say but we have to remember that what youre talking about is some guy in a mask assaulting a bloke in a dumb haircut on the street by all means take preventative measures in classrooms and whatnot to discourage these views but dont fucking assault people how is this difficult to understand it achieves nothing and it contravenes his liberties dont do it

socialism,removed,lol good you cant go around bombing hospitals and propping up dictators and expect no retaliation
socialism,removed,this happened because a jew tried to extort his mother not that you care we won today
socialism,removed,you learn about rand mises friedman and procapitalists because they are right and their system works however unfair it is you dont learn about marx because his theories are a complete and utter failure in every aspect on one side there is capitalism which operates under same ideas which have governed mankind since the day we came out of caves lust for wealth hierarchy and eternal struggle and on the other side there is marxism criticizing everything capitalist and offering an alternative but as soon as alternative is being implemented it turns into capitalism so why bother with a system so inherently flawed and ridiculous that it turns into its opponent and ends up even worse its a total embarrassment

socialism,removed,yeah but if were not careful what people we put in prison will end up being one more thing we have to be pc about child rapist and murder sorry we are over quota with minority prisoners
socialism,removed,ban this racist scum
socialism,removed,national liberation movements in imperialized countries should be supported dependent on its character however for socialists the national liberation movement must be rooted in the class struggle must be rooted in workingclass solidarity what i think comrades misunderstand is that socialist led national liberation movements want international workingclass revolution that it is not a rejection of internationalism but that their anguish cannot be tolerated anymore under the yoke of colonialism the chains of imperialism any hope of a dictatorship of the proletariat being established let alone socialism or communism cannot even be fathomed without the chains of imperialism and colonialism being cast off as much as we here on reddit would love a worldwide revolution erupting at the same time its extremely unlikely furthermore a socialist led national liberation movement can serve as inspiration for other socialist movements on top of that a country that underwent a national liberation movement must support workingclass struggle where and whenever possible socialists in imperialist countries must agitate educate and organize against imperialism to truly defeat the beast this is the other side of the coin to the socialist led national liberation movement to think otherwise and solely blame these movements when they descend into revisionism or have to compromise in order to survive or capitulate is myopic and i find many comrades such as uanonsocialist inadvertently or otherwise take a chauvinistic orientalist stance towards national liberation movements
socialism,removed,so what part of institutional racism is causing blacks to commit over half of all murders and over all rapes again
socialism,removed,i would recommend you wash dishes and bus tables with this career path youd actually be providing a service to your fellow humans

socialism,removed,the struggle against fascism begins with the struggle against bolshevism
socialism,removed,eh so are you
socialism,removed,nope islam is bad it divides people its untrue and causes harm and best its just a myth and worst its a murder cult
socialism,removed,fuck fascism and imperialism said the socialist as he defends the fascistimperialistexpansionist religion i dont think people should hurt you for your religion but i can call you a moron for believing in a reactionary religion
socialism,removed,i dont believe the us can win with the leftists in this situation should the us stop supporting the sdfsocialist army who is fighting isis fascists if they stopped supporting the sdf its doubtful the sdf would be able to defeat isis especially in well defended cities like manbij also if the us stops supporting sdf how many socialists would come out against the us for not supporting the sdf in the war against isis and make up some theories about how the us refuses to work with an anarchosocialist army we need to remember that the faster isis falls in cities the less damage they can do to the citizens of those cities isis is using the citizens for human shields they are murdering innocents raping women etc how exactly should this situation be handled in the eyes of people here because i dont see a better alternative other than the us being better at not hitting civilian heavy areas with their airstrikes despite the fact that the us has by far the most accurate air strikes in the world
socialism,removed,that muslims lack respect for women or democracy or are particularly violent

socialism,removed,collectivism doesnt have a pretty track record when it comes to feeding the masses
socialism,removed,holy fuck american socialists have really not understood yet that general solidarity with israel should be a moral obligation rather than a contradiction with socialist values as so often the response on this will be immensely hateful i presume but i really lose hope in every bit of leftist intellectualism when apparently it is more fashionable siding with the antisemitic jew hating pseudo rebels of the hamas than with the admittedly massively flawed but only democracy in the middle east which is surrounded by theo and autocratic pseudofascist and antisemitic states oh i forgot according to scholars like judith butler the hamas is part of the global progresive left i nearly forgot how the extermination of jews embedded in their charta is part of a socialist and progressive movement how stupid of me the palestinian people elected the hamas as their government which regularly embezzles un money or utilizes it for antisemitic propaganda in un financed schools when they are not busy abusing these very schools as human shields after their attacks on israel how dumb has a person to be to not get that the palestinian side of this conflict is actually ten times more similar to fascism with its antiemancipatory regressive government than israel ever will be real antifascism also means fighting islamofascists regimes but i guess in the us you are so blinded by this whole trump bullshit that you dont realize that criticizing the islamic ideology has nothing to do with xenophobia whatsoever just a small hint there is a reason why hitler sympathized with islam and the arabic world amongst others with palestinian leaders at that time who partly are still considered national heroes over there but go ahead i am waiting for the never changing israel bashing comments which mysteriously always end up sounding incredibly akin to century antisemitic propaganda cultural relativism is always a great thing isnt it solidarity with kurdistan and israel that is real antifascism
socialism,removed,maybe most of those empty homes are peoples second homes out in the middle of nowhere and therefor not terribly useful to homeless people

socialism,removed,by working
socialism,removed,just look at the introduction of free markets across the world in the century it is very clear that capitalism has indeed brought many people out of poverty
socialism,removed,historically more people have gone hungry due to communism communism doesnt work at all and if what you say is true then neither does capitalism therefore we should abolish government and live in huts
socialism,removed,food this is an issue not of food production but of the ability to distribute it would require many farms be massively repurposed towards food that doesnt spoil and then a considerable amount of money be expended on transporting it socialism globalism many people are going to be unwilling to give up a considerable quality of life and it would be considerable given the enormity of the task in order to stopgap an issue with no end in sight simply feeding the hungry across the globe will not turn their fields to farms or grant them roads more and more food would have to be pumped into the areas this is not a solution this is flagellation disguised as charity the only thing governments can do here is either a full scale military invasion or to help develop infrastructure the latter of which is being done already vacant homeshomeless which is predicated by mental illness simply putting them in the homes will not help these people dont have the ability to take care of themselves and need real meaningful care shoving them into houses in the middle of the country with no support services wont help this is a social issue thats much more complicated than simple capitalist issues and to suggest that the vacant homes are a travesty in any sense other than wasted resources which is legitimately a travesty is naive and selfindulgent while the problem wont go away in a capitalist society it isnt at all caused by it it was caused by a massive cultural misunderstanding of drugs and mental illness households are in debt this is a bloated figure most households are in debt because debt makes sense getting a mortgage on a house is often worthwhile because the costs are lower than rent is in their current homeapartment or the quality of life justifies the increase in monthly payments it makes sense to spend you know you dont have with a credit card you know youll be able to pay off before interest hits this is the exact same paradigm that would exist even in a communist society people would be given food homes et cetera before their total economic output actually meets their total value with the given things included this debt would simply be taken on across society with every person paying forward a small amount of their personal output instead of privately in either case this debt is taken on rationally mind you i would very much prefer a communistscoialist utopia if possible but the concept of material debt is rational whether its in a capitalist socialist or communist society the actual term your graph should be using is negative net worth the actual value is supposedly around which is a travesty itself but a hell of a lot lower than i agree that there are some horrible issues with capitalism and that a functional socialist model is preferable but you do yourself and the movement and enormous disservice by buying into shitty images that use bloated figures bad reasoning and inaccurate critiques
socialism,removed,yeah i really yearn for those russian bread lines they had in the
socialism,removed,says socialism lol great work with places like greece and venezuela
socialism,removed,case in point this sjw subreddit masquerading as a socialist subreddit
socialism,removed,pardon my ignorance but what exactly does this have to do with free markets this is colonization and imperial control at its highest capitalism doesnt explain the colonization of africa smug european kings do
socialism,removed,most are preparing for their sociology final this week they are pressed for time but they have doubletapped a few socialist instagram posts today
socialism,removed,delet this
socialism,removed,how else do we start a business achieve our dreams and in the end invent and revolutionize without the pros of capitalism you cant
socialism,removed,debt is amazing when you know how to wield it saying otherwise is really just ignorant
socialism,removed,coward admit you are wrong when proven wrong clearly you started with a conclusion you are brainwashed im a skeptic you are beneath me and not worth my time have fun with your wasted existence
socialism,removed,oh trust me im with you cuba sucks
socialism,removed,this is retarded
socialism,removed,socialism is all fun and games until you wind up in a gulag
socialism,removed,no its not the problem is total corruption and the mass theft of wealth and the lack of its redistribution the problem is human nature selfishness and pragmatism the same people who want to replace capitalism by socialism are the people fighting against the above wed have the same problem in socialism if it was controlled and owned by a of world billionaires
socialism,removed,stop arguing semantics like a dumbfuck without a real point to make
socialism,removed,im good in you super bolded just for you herpaderps statement of unequivocal condescension you said if you died because you couldnt afford a thing you needed to survive you died of poverty so ill ask again if i get totally wasted and run my shitty fiesta into a wall at a crash survivable in an sclass did i die of poverty
socialism,removed,no are you retarded i refuted his first wiki link and all he does is post another one instead of admitting he was wrong first that is cowardly only cowards dont apologize when proven wrong besides his alias makes it clear he is a dumbass and i suspect he doesnt know too means also so many people use too wrong and it usually means they are teenagers or uneducated
socialism,removed,pol told me debt is how jews steal your money
socialism,removed,yes it does
socialism,removed,those sources are absolutely laughable communismsocialism are proven failures and cant work with human oversight they devolve to dictatorship every time with out fail just ask north korea china venezuela cuba the list goes on for days your ideology is flawed

socialism,removed,typical libs experts say
socialism,removed,tfw msm is doing so bad youd rather listen to an autist on than the bs on cable
socialism,removed,no scots in scotland either
socialism,removed,becuse socialism worked
socialism,removed,dear folks from rsocialism if you shit on my front page ill shit on your page right back
socialism,removed,i still think the solution is to prohibit wealth transfer amongst nonarms length parties so that individuals only posses earned credit capitalism does facilitate efficiencies in the production of goods and provision of services but to each their own
socialism,removed,wow nice safe space you have here
socialism,removed,stop basing your ideology off of facebook infographics jesus christ
socialism,removed,yes sorry i was thinking of the ones that already tried and failed so badly they had to revert back to evil capitalism
socialism,removed,better than socialism obviously or else they wouldnt have changed back
socialism,removed,this post is so utterly ridiculous its amazing
socialism,removed,is this sub satirical
socialism,removed,in capitalism selfishness in encouraged and rewarded selfishness is rewarding by definition if giving money to the poor was rewarding then people would do it for the rewards thats still selfishness so you agree that an authoritarian state would be required but you think its going to be temporary why do you think an authoritarian government would give up the power even if said government wouldnt hold it out of malice they would still want to hold it because they think its best for the people hell even in this subreddit you have mods banning people for expressing negative opinions against socialism if they got the absolute power of an authoritarian government do you think they wont use it to suppress the opposing ideas you say it doesnt have to be but that doesnt mean it wont be its like saying that a wolf in sheeps den doesnt have to kill the sheep but he will youre taking the absolute best case scenario that assumes that no power will be abused by an entity of immense power thats entirely unrealistic
socialism,removed,because they were already shitty places to live in like cuba being the whorehouse for the us we really cant know what wouldve happened if another capitalist government assumed the place of the old one it may have been even better than what socialism has done for cuba
socialism,removed,and the point of this subreddit is what posts like this this post is pure garbage it just spouts off statistics like theyre facts and then the only source is just food and agricultureorg im sick of my ideology being treated like this you mods should be ashamed of yourselves
socialism,removed,its not capitalism if government chooses the winners and the losers its not capitalism when an industry is ruled by a monopoly its not capitalism when the big businesses are bailed out its not capitalism when the cost of entry into the market is too damn high due to license and certification fees you keep using that word i dont think it means what you think it means
socialism,removed,a cooperative corporation or simply a cooperative is a special form of corporation that places ownership andor control of the corporation in the hands of the employees or patrons of the corporation socialism is a collection of such similar corporations
socialism,removed,i mean my parents as well as my entire family is from the former ussr it did not work
socialism,removed,im sorry you feel for their trap this place is basically the rthedonald but for socialism anyone who disagrees with the mods gets a permanent ban here comes mine im sure
socialism,removed,thats as may be but no largescale collectivist economic philosophy has ever been beneficial
socialism,removed,none of this explains how capitalism is at fault it just gives scary statistics and blames capitalism
socialism,removed,pedantic much this is the least useful and interesting thing to argue over its like arguing if the curtains are pink or magenta in the end it really makes no fucking difference unless youre an eautist who gets a chubby over feeling like youre right
socialism,removed,shit ourselves to show them that trump is not my president
socialism,removed,i think trump is the worst thing that has happened to this country since this homophobic racist totally bigot man is going to go down as a big shit stain in the history of our beautiful country
socialism,removed,we need to do this guys donald trump is already creating racism and hate trump is driving our communities to shit if i have to act like a baby i will notmypresident shitrump
socialism,removed,report him for having a certain political leaning thats a little fascist dont you think
socialism,removed,nice wall to anyone who doesnt believe what i do
socialism,removed,probably but using fascist methods is just as bad very tankie like
socialism,removed,socialists confiscate pie and divide it among the people the next pie is smaller then smaller and smaller meanwhile the country next door has wall to wall pies and lots of different kinds socialists then pass a law that there be more pies in their country pretty soon the socialists start to notice people moving to other country to join in the pie craze they restrict immigration out and confiscate peoples property as they leave socialist party members start putting citizens in work camps and force them to make pies they are stale and flavorless yeah i really want to live in a socialist utopia
socialism,removed,phobia means the fear is irrational theres nothing irrational about being afraid of terrorists
socialism,removed,furthermore i think that while capitalism is always the enemy of the far left alternative threats and enemies can supersede it for a while like the rise of fascism in europe
socialism,removed,almost like a large swath of lgbt intolerance directed solely in the middle east pah a coincidence crawl out from under your rock
socialism,removed,why i dont like what he has to say so we should ban him now if he is actually teaching people how to commit a successful rape thats a different story but from the book title and description it look like far right rantings about feminism and sjw this is a typical liberal response to opposing views lets ban them i could very well say lets report ugnodez because he supports an authoritarian dictator that caused mass amounts of death please dont argue on my mao comments this is about speech not state capitalist rulers also drumpf really
socialism,removed,whats absurd
socialism,removed,i disagree stretching a powerful term such as racism to cover some other social ill you wish to bring social awareness and focus towards reduces the terms focus meaning and power would we say being vertically challenged short covers being fat attempting to rebuild language to support your ideology weakens an argument that the idea can stand on its own it is bad strategery dont you have words
socialism,removed,this book about free speech is a terrible farce the entire book is self righteous bs about how he successfully defeated the global establishment and sjw its a stupid book about a self righteous narcissist and his shitty quest but ultimately its is not a how to rape someone book all the mao stuff were straw man comments on him it was more to prove a point than anything else and not a definitive statement do you think rapists should have the right to talk about precisely how to rape people no they shouldnt but the book isnt a rape guide its are shitty rant about feminism and the global elite minority in the survey that supported freedom of speech for fascists yes because why should the state control what people can stay your a fucking maoist for christ sakes you supposed to be anti state some people would consider you a fascist so should you have your speech controlled drumpf is literally liberal propaganda as some way to deal with a proto fascist so yes we really do not like what he has to say neither do i relevant evelyn hall quote i do not agree with what you have to say but ill defend to the death your right to say it
socialism,removed,because it furthers his bs narrative that the global elite are trying to silence him let idiots speak them selves they end it far faster than any silencing can do httpsenwikipediaorgwikibritishnationalparty is a great example of this
socialism,removed,said every liberal ever the question of free speech is not necessarily one of the state alright who controls it then if not the state who will
socialism,removed,yes i did thats why i said really drumpf not the xenophobia part but its a ridiculous action to take against a facist
socialism,removed,multiple reasons how can you claim any credibility if you cant stand a book that you dont even have to look at your creating a bubble or a safe space where all ideas you dont deem acceptable are thrown out you give people like this ammo and a soap box
socialism,removed,why though let these people speak they kill there movement by themselves httpsenwikipediaorgwikibritishnationalparty relevant read
socialism,removed,it turns out that good muslim vs bad muslim is just an updated version of the colonial era good savage vs bad savage trope if that is the case then i would say that there are no good muslims islam is at its core both homophobic and antifemale it is not compatible with western society many muslims can conform to our way of life when they immigrate but a majority of them still hold their cultural beliefs i wish the left could stop defending islam
socialism,removed,your a deceived comrade and i hope you can grow past it
socialism,removed,f
socialism,removed,f
socialism,removed,number one the camera man is a faggot for not giving him money number two the bitch has cotton candy
socialism,removed,this is what socialism is about ultimately thats the problem i will always have people dont deserve to die because they choose to believe or not believe in something or wish to associate in a certain way the way i see it real true full socialism will always lead to killing because some people will refuse to comply and if you have to kill for an ideology then it isnt right sorry
socialism,removed,u
socialism,removed,no you fucking wont keyboard tankie shit
socialism,removed,ok not sure if youre too particularly keen on but for personal reasons i was more blood and fire than i usually am or want to come across exploited for excess labor value and so forth look i just want to say this its really not a fair analysis comparing what the prc is right now to what for example other countries were when there was at least a semblance of a socialist support network cuba is still the best country in its area in terms of qol nk had a higher qol than the south until the fall of the ussr the ussr itself was the fastest industrialization and improvement of qol the world has ever seen i have my own problems with lenin mao and stalin particularly stalin but to pretend that these two were not superior in nearly every quality to any country in the western world is absolutely silly the rampant imperialism of the west has left billions destitute and even in the us there is trouble in paradise the core of my tendency is that i believe that the ends justify the means if anarchists ever prove that you are the best way to advance my material conditions ill swap at a moments notice because im only in this for the materialism but until then i look at examples of uprisings and you know what happened to the ones that didnt take up the red they were destroyed and while im sure anarchists would be quick to point the finger at the reds we all know the white army and fascists were the root cause of the demise of anarchist movements all over and they all got crushed i simply do not believe that a small sample size justifies abandoning what has been both in practice and on paper the most effective method of disrupting bourgeoisie control
socialism,removed,hows venezuela doing these days
socialism,removed,one day youll understand its ok
socialism,removed,f
socialism,removed,its probably due to the monthly minimum wage increases or the lack of resources due to the devaluation of the bolivar but thats just a guess
socialism,removed,the was an inside job and all of the senior nazis were jews ernst röhm and the sa hierarchy the non jewish nazis whose zionist financed wickedness and thuggery brought him to power were liquidated in the of june after h was sworn in as german chancellor january jews put corrupt gentiles like bush obama and donald trump into nominally powerful positions then surround them with their people who wield the real power so when things go south they can scapegoat their gentile puppets for their sordid malfeasance jew lazar kaganovich was the real master of the kremlin during the httpssovereignukrainenetstalinistmassmurderandthewarpingofrussianhistory era did their comeuppance will be by way of legal arrest and just trial under the capital anti terror strictures of existing us law where after a lawful verdict of guilty so will the lot be off to the execution dias anticipate a death toll among jews to rival hitlers tally
socialism,removed,good point dont want to damage the ecosystem
socialism,removed,my favourite kind of commie a dead one who the f have any respect today for this creature
socialism,removed,bankers funded the bolsheviks httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpyvbiaxvevk
socialism,removed,its fucking facts ffs youre braindead i guess henry ford sending hitler funds is an anticapitalist white conspiracy theory
socialism,removed,this is definitely true capitalism is for sure better than socialism
socialism,removed,you have been brain washed by putin and stalin
socialism,removed,or they dont want to shine the light on the fact that the nations were ok with it until they didnt get the huge amount of money they demanded then when the pipe line was redirected protests
socialism,removed,it doesnt matter who did the stabbing regardless of their political views stabbing people is bad supporting a person who happens to agree with some of your points of view despite their actions is dangerous and morally highly questionable
socialism,removed,subtle but brilliant propaganda a good showing of why the brits will always be the greatest propagandists theres a reason goebbels had such respect for british propaganda a min podcast which starts with intro music from russian marching songs interspersed with punk and reggae music and finishing up discussing utopianism with peter kitchens
socialism,removed,comrade do your duty for the revolution end your middle class life
socialism,removed,your position is one of ludicrous doctrinal adherence and you should kill yourself for the good of the revolution
socialism,removed,i thought regulation was a good thing
socialism,removed,i agree i think the best solution is that letting guy taste his own medicine in prison like this guy
socialism,removed,viva la franco granted the bastard had only one ball and a very effeminated high pitch voice but he wasnt a full on trans serb fascists i am dissappoint
socialism,removed,obama is a piece of shit deserves worse than death
socialism,removed,what is web address for the encrypted forum
socialism,removed,its not the rich wholl suffer ya eejit
socialism,removed,honestly this who thing about the mean of production being controlled by the government is really starting to drive me up a wall because in practice every socialistcommunist government has had a totalitarian or near totalitarian state control the means of production see ussr china venezuela you cant just keep using well if i was in control it would be different as a way to deflect
socialism,removed,why is this in rsocialism were they murders or assassinations were that many civilians in columbia political leaders without being politicians
socialism,removed,socialism is an intrinsically inclusive ideology but then why do you pit on part of the population against another
socialism,removed,that doesnt seem like much of an achievement they both murdered civilians assassination implies that the victim was someone politically important martin luther king john f kennedy edward snowden murder is when normal civilians are killed the title is kind of click bait because assassination sounds more important than murder
socialism,removed,competing to be the least homicidal doesnt exactly make you sound great though yeah maybe i did rape and murder people but that guy raped and murdered
socialism,removed,so what does this have to do with socialism
socialism,removed,everything is fascism on the rise rsocialism
socialism,removed,im sure on this subthe obvious connection of education and intelligence will be disregarded if athletes are your greatest intellectual role models might not be them that has the problem
socialism,removed,haha not a surprising response from a sub full of internet activists
socialism,removed,yes its just some edgy comedy show that relies on shock value to offend liberal pc culture i dont see it as any different than south park
socialism,removed,not a surprising response from someone who doesnt understand oppression management activism or even football hahahahahahaaha im ok with people being socialists but you arent a socialist you are just an idiot masquerading as a leftist

socialism,removed,how is abortion a socialist issue
socialism,removed,we as socialist should stand with the working class not a person not a state even if such personstate is flipping off western states that isnt a socialist position thats an ultra position the workers arent an amorphous blob in the real world states exist whether or not you agree with this articles conclusions to say we should not support states but workers is a meaningless and vague statement that sounds like politician speak ironically
socialism,removed,and the child has no rights
socialism,removed,surely socialists are supposed to champion the vulnerable and to work towards ensuring fairness and equality theres really noone more vulnerable than an unborn baby who cant even raise her own eyes to defend her life
socialism,removed,they said we should never support states period unless i misunderstood
socialism,removed,okay but what did the op of the thread mean
socialism,removed,so if the usa decided to invade zimbawbe we shouldnt defend zimbawbwe
socialism,removed,we dont care what foreigners think about our abortion laws
socialism,removed,i fail to see whats wrong with the iraq statement support is not an endorsement of the policies of the government its just that those decisions should be in the hands of the iraqizimbawbwesyrianetc people not foreign governments imposing their will its selfdetermination
socialism,removed,first world people hate thirdworld dictators more than anything in this world everyone can name mugabe but ask them abou the president of niger the actual head of state of libya or usbacked dictators in africa and surprise how come they dont know their names maybe it has something to do with the wests demonizing of its opposing leaders to justify possible interventions and regime changes as far as these leftists are concerned zimabwe would still be better being called rhodesia they cant stand that thirdworld countries have their own political processes or that people they dont like and therefore because they dont like them they wont support the country against aggression are there with popular support yes whatever you might say the guy still has support and probably more than youd like and that shouldnt make us act paternalistically and uncritically of us human rights agenda in the region behind their masks of ngo neutrality
socialism,removed,if your revolution gets to the point where you have to start using slavelabor your revolution may not be as righteous as you think it is
socialism,removed,books arent a commodity
socialism,removed,i think it tastes pretty good then again i dont eat raw meat like you seem to do
socialism,removed,the right to life is the most fundamental human right because without it we have no rights at all
socialism,removed,off to the gulag
socialism,removed,and how would you rebuild poor areas and the rest of the world look at my flair do you really think i care about the entire world so long as i can freely associate with different people and communities without some state breathing down my neck ill be content i do think that international revolution would help prevent capitalist imperialism from fucking things up but that still doesnt make it my responsibility to liberate everyone else how are you different from the ancoms who want to go start galtland you mean ancaps i mean i support communism and oppose capitalism and statism because id rather live under the former than the latter
socialism,removed,something more intelligent than that at least
socialism,removed,something that is hard to come by is by my definition a commodity
socialism,removed,lets not do that it is just as crazy as it sounds
socialism,removed,ah anyway no youre not fetishizing anything you can keep books in your house if you bought them you may not believe in capitalism but the society you live in probably does so no one will mind plus with your ideology im sure youd happily lend those books to anyone who asks or even give it to them so it doesnt really matter
socialism,removed,every crimes a hate crime

socialism,removed,we dont expect people to not get mad lol
socialism,removed,i hold a ccw in multiple states every state every gun safety course i have ever taken advises advise the officer immediately failure to disclose may not be a crime in the area but the officer is trained to treat any armed person as potentially hostile keep your hands on the wheel or elevated and away from anything you might be reaching for and ask the officer how to proceed the nra wont get involved because he violated their training by reaching for something while armed and dealing with a cop i wear my weapon on my rear right hip i offer to lean forward and be disarmed with ample warning that the officer will see my buttcrack and telling him i didnt need a female officer i got a ticket last week it was a pain but after disclosing my weapon i already knew my car would be searched it was once backup arrived i was cool with the officers and they were cool with me before everyone assumes my demographics female mid dressed like crap dirty old gym clothes tattoos mixed moms white dads middle eastern the cop was wrong and so was the man who was shot you dont tell an armed person youre armed and then reach for something
socialism,removed,including that part where i said where the cop was wrong and so was the victim
socialism,removed,are the best anarchists
socialism,removed,this is completely one sided and borders on outright inaccuracy its pure sensationalism doing this will only undermine your movement
socialism,removed,omg you guys in this thread are so deluded you are making a caricature of the movement
socialism,removed,i support the eu simply because my country is really fucking dependant on trade we would collapse without it
socialism,removed,lol i love how you think that some fat old lad making a vlog who has probably been on the left for the whole of his miserable existence is evidence of class consciousness spreading corbyns poll numbers are abysmal the tories have a better approval rating than labour in scotland scotland where tory is a slur by all means though keep him im a tory so his prescence guarantees tory rule through
socialism,removed,hes not spreading anything hes a national meme and even if then what violent overthrow lol not only would that get shut down by our military but the americans would be here quicker than you can say red scare the only people who like him are his fanboys nobody is getting converted if anything hes just scaring people away from the labour movement
socialism,removed,there are million people in the entire country so half a million isnt really a large number at all membership of the tory party is pointless the committee chooses the leader
socialism,removed,if liberalism is about universalism and egalitarianism then how come it has a long sordid and ongoing history of actively denying the rights of women queer people people of color working class people first peoples people of specific ethnicities or religions and so on could you elaborate on this point or provide a historic and contemporary example of how liberalism denies the rights of all those you have mentioned
socialism,removed,this is in no way true socialism destroys itself and powerful countries step in to halt the overpowered socialist governments that are abusing their power and not serving their people
socialism,removed,until the bodies start hitting the floor
socialism,removed,when dealing with decades and decades of suicide bombs and machine gun attacks you wouldnt be wise to hand your soldiers tazers and hope the terrorists just wont explode this time and its hard to occupy the land where your people have lived for thousands of years
socialism,removed,polling data will later refute all sources of corporate metrics buy me a coke bitch
socialism,removed,i guess america forced all those communists to install dictatorships and mass murder their political opponents

socialism,removed,you dont know very many cops i gather good cops are the key to reducing police brutality and people who work on effective accountability campaigns get to know good cops as well as bad what you say sounds edgy but its not true
socialism,removed,i dont answer to you what you need to know is that i cant be driven away
socialism,removed,this sub is so infected with puritopians ftfy
socialism,removed,you dont understand the nature of brotherhoodsisterhood that goes on in police forces i was in the military and its basically all or nothing man you sound pretty cuck tho

socialism,removed,north koreans dont have food
socialism,removed,way to go lefties you found another kid living at his parents sporting staterun commie propaganda posters to lecture adults about the real world from the swollen red inflammation around his nose im going to venture that he may still be in high school can he grow a mustache to hide the acne come on this is pathetic i feel sorry for you looking up to this school child oh wait i mean communist revolutionarythat still lives at home
socialism,removed,lefty thats called a strawman you dolt
socialism,removed,good riddance
socialism,removed,i hope you all realize socialism means more government control ask yourself if government corruption is the problem why would you expect more government to fix it
socialism,removed,this thread reeks of old rightwingers or people raised with such beliefs that got into the left after those ideas have been drilled into their heads and then try to justify their paternalism with the allencompassing material conditions argument they really have no legs to stand on though i used to be an obedient bible thumping republican boy when i became a socialist i almost immediately all the bullshit i tied myself down with for years upon years why these guys didnt do that too confuses me
socialism,removed,ill tell you what id do man two chicks at the same time man

socialism,removed,this is gonna be one of those threads wont it
socialism,removed,the altright is a pc term for neonazi they get all sensitive when you call them a neonazi fascist sure pc police are annyoing but antipc people are the worst and are increasing more than ever than propc i guess i encounter more pro pc irl than online and vice versa with antipc antipc people are like the sjw of the internet its just my observation and opinion
socialism,removed,one would think a socialist would be sympathetic to the welfare of everybody
socialism,removed,personally i am all for keeping a sensible level of respect to all humans and language does play a role in that i think you hit the nail on the head everyone deserves being treated like a human i think theres a time and place for everything but some people really have an allornothing mentality or are trying to be very edgy the whole humungous what lady – fuck her those are the type of people that sjw and pc culture reference anymore some people take it too far and completely lose their sense of humor an example i love is blazing saddles there are people who get butthurt over it then there are those who see the humor irony and that it was showing the ridiculousness of racism i can understand if an individual person would not want to watch it – but to think everyone that enjoys the movie is a racist thats quite a step to take
socialism,removed,hilarious s for real though what purpose does it serve to wish suffering on somebody vindictiveness is a useless emotion in my view malice in the name of revenge is still malice
socialism,removed,ya but how do you know which deaths by police officers were justified or not police work is dangerous and every single day there is a possibility of a life threatening situation i would put money on the assumption that quite a few of those police related deaths included some perpetrator with a lethal weapon
socialism,removed,how did he survive in east germany then
socialism,removed,fuck this post so much
socialism,removed,i mean it has gotten out of hand to a degree case in point a few years ago at work someone stole my carhart jacket dead of fucking winter and i had to walk home no one wanted to point the finger at the new guy because he was black and they didnt want to appear racist i didnt care either way dude could have been purple with green fucking polka dots for all i care he got hired shit started dissapearing the math isnt that hard no one wanted to even broach it until someone caught him breaking open a god damn locker
socialism,removed,is it politically correct to say asians are less likely to get into the nba or blacks are less likely to get into university
socialism,removed,to say that the police are responsible for foreign wars of aggression and genocides is still absurd and based on nothing at all except for a series of steps to kevin baconstyle connections from police to government to military to war this is also a sadly humorous narrow view of police violence its evident you have no clue what you are talking about speaking only in generalities the cause of police violence is the state and capitalism that is the equivalent of the cause of the temperature is the sky no examination of any of what that entails we dont discuss culture and subculture the culture of violence in inner cities crime as a last resort violent actions taken against the community prompting a reaction or any of that youll get your karma this much is obvious but this post is as good as blank
socialism,removed,violence is a part of a cops job they constantly confronted with life threatening situations of course this will result in a larger number of killings by police than by any group of normal citizens i am not saying that police brutality does not exist but this comparison is definitely flawed
socialism,removed,my comment doesnt in any way try to argue about the morality of what they are doing the only thing i am saying is that you cannot base an argument that police is inherently violent just on this statistic
socialism,removed,as if the soviet union has a great thing
socialism,removed,thats not going to convince anyone
socialism,removed,god you people are evil
socialism,removed,what if theyve never raped anyone also stinky really do you want your point to be taken seriously or as the inane rantings of a juvenile
socialism,removed,this is just retarded why is this even upvoted
socialism,removed,well maybe we should make sure you understand what antilabor means to be against work towards economic gain i dont wholeheartedly support trump but you cant tell me a billionaire businessman is antilabor youre using vague labels to attack the opposing view rather than examine and think about the content of the matter being antilabor isnt the same as antiunion furthermore not supporting or recognizing one union isnt the same as being completely antiunion you should stop trying to generalize in order to push your agenda ahahahahaha get back to work thats an insult are you serious minimum wage doesnt work people on it cant make a living anyways ill find a source if you want but if minimum wage was adjusted to inflation it would be way way higher than it is now its called free market jobs that offer crap pay wont have any employees at the same time it is nice to have a sense of security but like i said minimum wage is already a joke to begin with what would you do
socialism,removed,the phrase fake news has exploded in usage since the election but the term is similar to other malleable political labels such as terrorism and hate speech because the phrase lacks any clear definition it is essentially useless except as an instrument of propaganda and censorship the most important fact to realize about this new term those who most loudly denounce fake news are typically those most aggressively disseminating it
socialism,removed,seeing them as inseparable is the exact same thing as dismissing them as irrelevant to the class struggle
socialism,removed,good feminism is not being a feminist and instead being a communist
socialism,removed,in a way though thats exactly what hes saying i had a dad who made me read a few of his books and he is for regulations its just that hes only for the ones that he likes he wants to punish players who manipulate the economy and he was also a fan of antitrust laws specifically against them fighting monopolies although he did oppose their actions on microsoft or against labor unions for example little known fact friedman is the reason we have withholding tax in america idk the meme seems to not understand his point in that he actually agrees with you on the role of government as far as enforcing laws goes still though hes wrong about a lot of things
socialism,removed,i do for confederates and other racists they deserve to be treated like a black person in the century only then only then will they finally truly understand why blacks bitch about slavery and racism i support gulags ban me if you must but we must stop beating around the bush and treat these bastards the way how an exterminator treats a roach
socialism,removed,no i was saying marx is awesome because hes not a feminist
socialism,removed,honest question why cant we joke about whatever we want isnt freedom of speech the most integral part of discourse
socialism,removed,wow what a paranoid batshit crazy video the illuminaty conspiracy theories arent as bad in comparison
socialism,removed,its funny that you quote an anarchist on what the role of the government should be
socialism,removed,i love how tough guy threats that would make an call of duty player roll his eyes are your guys idea of revolutionary change
socialism,removed,what did you use to post this
socialism,removed,so we should live in a capitalist country so were not slaves making toys
socialism,removed,you people have your heads so far up your asses its unbelievable
socialism,removed,i know this is going to be unpopular here but like china have done some amazingly commy things recently their water management projects have lifted millions from poverty created sustainable farmland fed villages where education and healthcare are provided to people thatve never had it before also all the evil factories like the one in the image actually most arent so bad in china china has an amazing program where people work at factories do a government run training thing with a proper curriculum and lessons and everything so that they work hard study hard and leave with qualified to go into a city job management or design quite a few of the people who ive spoken to that design electronics in small factories studied while working on electronics lines its an amazing way of learning because theyre surrounded by it all day thats why all the best gadgets are chinese these days their government runs ubuntu too thats pretty cool tldr china not as bad as people say
socialism,removed,i dont know requiring the state to have board seats on all companies is kinda communist
socialism,removed,wife looks hot full album plz
socialism,removed,im and this is deep
socialism,removed,there are plenty of companies who dont practice this
socialism,removed,it also happens to be my birth year which is why i choose it
socialism,removed,truly thats just my birth year i was commenting on the comic
socialism,removed,is the real fight then not capitalism vs communism and actually just a question of workers rights
socialism,removed,rather than switching a system of government things like profit sharing and entrepreneurialism would solve these problems no second point is its a two way street when the workers are in high demand we are getting a far larger portion of the pie like they are in my field is the worker to blame for entering a field where the worker is easily replaced for example not a skilled field or a trade with an abundant supply of labor
socialism,removed,without the corporate man or the gman there needs to be someone to organize the labor and capital into a product that is beneficial to society in one way or another i think you would like what this businessman has to say
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,i know this is rsocialism but if trump plans to bring back a lot of manufacturing to the us wouldnt that potentially help with this at least a little
socialism,removed,my socialist alternative branch is organizing a walkout for students and workers throughout the city some other comrades i know are going to washington dc for protests
socialism,removed,should have made them black kids i mean if you are going to lie lets go all the way baby
socialism,removed,top happy capitalists bottom shithole socialists
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,most things arent made with child labor though
socialism,removed,ninety percent of the posts here and on rlatestagecapitalism belong on
socialism,removed,the joy of the developed world is not built on the misery of child laborers
socialism,removed,you know most of these products come from socialist countries like china and vietnam right
socialism,removed,government economics ie coercive economics
socialism,removed,yeah really sucks that in a socialistic society such as in venezuela currency becomes so devalued that people put their children to work just to afford food
socialism,removed,i thought this was rsocialism shouldnt we be hiding how much better off capitalist societies are than socialist ones
socialism,removed,but what happens to the poor blue asian kids when the transformer factory get shuts down
socialism,removed,well i suppose socialist the state owns companies
socialism,removed,funny how the slave child labor is coming from socialist countries and no they arent really socialist is not an adequate rebuttal just like usa isnt really capitalist
socialism,removed,those kids in china are so lucky they get to play with toys all day
socialism,removed,the other thing i find funny is that the cheap shitty labor that supports our evil capitalist society generally comes from communist countries eg china because they have awful labor standards compared to the ones in our first world capitalist shitholes
socialism,removed,riamverysmart
socialism,removed,zizek is huh also it would be horror to say i love isis but look at its organisation with its postmodern fluid identity there is an emancipatory underground tendency in islam a wonderful muslim historian of philosophy developed a claim that aquinas misread aristotle under the influence of islamic poets like avicenna which opened up the way for modernity gay rights and so on lol
socialism,removed,the irony is that this is to any sane person at least a statement against socialism in america a capitalist country nobody is forced to work and we are very prosperous in socialist countries run by the govt like china kids pretty much have to work and it is run by the government
socialism,removed,they arent being held hostage from you you dont have some magical right to food if you want food you need to earn it ik socialists love this utopia where everybody gets what they want but in real life thats not how things work
socialism,removed,this entire sub is the embodiment of mixed with
socialism,removed,i do feel bad for those kids but im not gonna do jackshit about it
socialism,removed,who are behind this campaign
socialism,removed,for those who came to shitpost about how china and other regions within the capitalist periphery are actually socialist you are all unoriginal slobs we laugh at you you will be banned i feel like that can be a tad too much
socialism,removed,socialism works guys
socialism,removed,yet again you guys make a post which contradicts your very argument can someone please explain how this picture is anticapitalism prosocialism in which a child is happy with a new toy in a capitalist society presumably america and the children are being worked to death in a country most likely socialist presumably china
socialism,removed,ayy
socialism,removed,yeah i do the fact you have to resort to personal insults is telling at how weak your position is
socialism,removed,right but there is nothing in the us constitution that endorses killing homosexuals
socialism,removed,lgbt have every right to be afraid of muslims as islam the ideology muslims adhere to encourages the killing of homosexuals as we had just witnessed
socialism,removed,the same people that want me put in a conversion camp are going to be the same people who want muslims thrown out of the country for this you really have no idea whether its true or not stop making shit up and getting angry about it but i guess white people arent responsible for charleston white people arent an ideology like islam is
socialism,removed,by that logic we should be just as scared of christians we shouldnt be because christians do not throw gays off roofs or go to clubs and shoot people
socialism,removed,i genuinely sincerely hope every single person on rthedonald gets brutally murdered
socialism,removed,whos they and whom are they trying to throw in jail just for existing
socialism,removed,in the muslim holy texts there are passages that endorse it
socialism,removed,how many people has this law been used against
socialism,removed,but guys its okay if their religion condones rape and murder dont you feel sorry for them or guys come on stop making fun of amir because his dad is a goatfucker
socialism,removed,the problem is islam is shit most religions are am i islamophobic because i hate religion which by extension means i hate islam its an ideology just as is capitalism and just like capitalism the downsides are glaring at this point in time needless to say they are on our radar more than they ever have been if we can shit on capitalism and capitalists then we can shit on islam and islamists well agree to disagree
socialism,removed,the problem is people hating capitalists oftentimes opposition to capitalists or capitalism is used to express this in a more politically correct fashion look at this rsocialism
socialism,removed,whats the point of identifying as a religion if you dont really believe the book
socialism,removed,religion fucking sucks why defend it the only thing i want to get across is that religion should not be used to keep the working class divided but otherwise fuck muslims christians jews and every other religion
socialism,removed,its hypocrisy
socialism,removed,oh fuck yourself disgusting censorship apologist
socialism,removed,at least they are using the term safe space unironically and literally jerking each others dicks off baby steps
socialism,removed,was his comment deleted by the mods like in other censoring subreddits no he was banned for calling trump a racist in a trump subreddit its pretty simple
socialism,removed,so that essentially means there is nowhere on reddit that allows you to talk about anything right because as hypocritical and retarded those mods are i dont see other subs doing any better to be honest
socialism,removed,strange that when you act like a troll you get banned because that doesnt actually foster discussion golly who knew that would happen
socialism,removed,its a fuckin pro trump sub for christ sakes are you people seriously this fucking retarded hehe wow theyre not actually free speech i just insulted trump on a pro trump sub and i got banned hehe seriously get a fuckin brain
socialism,removed,socialism is the last bastion of people who know deep down that they will never achieve anything with thier lives and who at the same time believes they are morally superior to others around them
socialism,removed,as for me im sobered im reminded of how gay rights have progressed in american and western societies more so than any other culture despite hate and opposition gay rights have advanced significantly because of free speech exactly this there are no muslim majority countries that could even be classified as somewhat friendly to lgbt people the west is the only place our protection is enshrined in law
socialism,removed,its not fair to say muslims are oppressed when its an ideology we dont say fascists are oppressed people choose to follow islam or are brainwashed from birth if your talking about the visible minority aspect then of course thats shitty but it has nothing to do with this conversation
socialism,removed,why are you here
socialism,removed,what crowder is doing here is comparing the socialist ideas of hitler and the socialist ideas of americas leftists today in he wasnt a liberal progressive but if he were around today he most likely wouldnt be labeled a conservative just a racist leftist
socialism,removed,he invites leftists guests all the time
socialism,removed,no giving everyone who needed a job a job working for the state increasing the size of the state nationalized healthcare gun control up to an tax proabortion and blaming the jews
socialism,removed,thats kinda the problem with socialism not everybody wants it so it wouldnt necessarily work unless the whole world or at least an enormous portion was unanimous about becoming socialist
socialism,removed,what crowder is saying is that hitlers aforementioned ideas parallel todays leftists and general bernie socialists i understand that there are different schools of socislism like there are any ideology
socialism,removed,that cunt with the slicked black hair trying to be condescending about something tom clearly knows more about is fucking infuriating
socialism,removed,as socialists we should all httpiimgurcommrrpqizpng
socialism,removed,i dont understand the degree of mental gymnastics needed for op to think this way
socialism,removed,islamism is political islam its called the implementation sharia law it has its own system of jurisprudence laws etc ever heard of it the ideology has all components of fascism
socialism,removed,the whole we must protect them train of thought im not a racist or a bigot but i read the news and i see that across the world muslims are stirring up shit shooting people and blowing things up yet ops title somehow conveys its a small group of fascists causing people to be antimuslim when it is in fact the actions of muslims across the world
socialism,removed,lol indeed you outright deny that there are muslims around the world killing people and destroying things ruining peoples opinions of muslims perhaps if youd read the rest of my post youd see im not implicating the innocents but its not some small group of fascists thats poisoning peoples opinions of muslims its the actions of their own extremists
socialism,removed,what claim are you denying that sharia is part of islam or that millions of muslims do not hold beliefs about apostates gays or women that are harmful to pluralisticsocialist causes look at the evidence provided being a muslim does not grant you any immunity from having to face the facts
socialism,removed,your right there must not be any other muslims committing atrocities right oh wait
socialism,removed,so being socialist means you have to like muslims the fuck
socialism,removed,no simpleton i addressed the rest of your post you simply choose to ignore it im not denigrating anyone merely started that it is the actions of muslims that are sitting people the world over muslims youd understand the difference if your head wasnt entirely vacuous you spoon fed moron
socialism,removed,totally agree with you white people and christians can be just as terrible too never said anything about that but denying that islam breeds a good bit more hatred and violence than other religions is just being blind
socialism,removed,theres a giant problem of radical terrorism and backward beliefs in the muslim culture and community its not bigoted to recognize that
socialism,removed,lovely all hail the god emperor president trump
socialism,removed,if i wanted people to back me up id have to already be a bigot im just not willing to back up a group of people who are detrimental to what weve been building for centuries
socialism,removed,lol please stop stigmatizing crowd shooters
socialism,removed,hey look at that an islamic extremist commits the worst mass shooting in american history and the response of rsocialism is to be concerned that some people might view islam in a negative light amazing
socialism,removed,jesus told him to kill bc of whorelandos how do they know god talking to them
socialism,removed,trump is a gay icon and thedonald worships milo yiannopoulos who is gay
socialism,removed,nice sweeping generalization
socialism,removed,oh my god go die stupid dumbshit reactionary it also says to enslave nonchristians in the bible but i doubt youd ever say jack fucking shit about christianity daesh is a political movement they have zero aspects of islam and again it is literally a holiday in islam which specifically states not to be violent fuck off
socialism,removed,assholes blame it on muslims we blame it on islam because it condones this type of behavior
socialism,removed,whoever they were they were trump supporters in the sense that even islamists would want trump to increase the divide
socialism,removed,just like the democratic peoples republic of korea is democratic
socialism,removed,triggered it gives you a hemorrhage because you cant confront the fact that socialism is a failed century idea thats been tried and failed extensively multiple times
socialism,removed,i know i need my privilege checked
socialism,removed,and nationalizing their daughter
socialism,removed,but socialism is inherently fascist the key issue is automatically assuming fascism will be bad
socialism,removed,so i think maybe you should calm your tits the first place someone is going to come to learn about socialism on reddit is rsocialism youre literally coming at me in a very very hostile way calling me your enemy and i have no fucking idea why at the very least as a socialist yourself i presume you should be happy as fuck with all the political fallout in the us that is showing americans how fucked up our system is and the best you can hope for is that theywe start moving towards becoming socialists your attitude is bad and it is not helping in anyway if you want to scare people away that only want to learn about socialism youre doing a good job
socialism,removed,whose pissy i merely stated a fact about me
socialism,removed,not calling anyone a coward for downvoting me calling them a coward for using the downvote function as a tool to disagree since theyre too much of a coward to offer any discussion on why they disagree with what i may have said
socialism,removed,google anita sarkeesian people like her tarnish the word from never fullfilling her kickstarter pledges and has the guts to start others and people still donate and demanding jobs from companies like intel despite not knowing much of anything in the field theyre pratically petite bourgeoisie that want money and use feminist ideas manipulating and tarnishing its name for their selfish desires many others are just liberals and there are some that are some antimen so much for egalitarian equality
socialism,removed,thats just as ridiculous as saying atomic theory destroyed hiroshima and nagasaki people did capitalism isnt some moustache twirling ideology built upon enslavement if youd read on the wealth of nations by adam smith youd know that capitalism is the distillation of the rules of trade and barter
socialism,removed,no its more like the only guy who can help is miles away and uses expensive tools and you need quid to buy an uber to get him there prices in a market economy are dictated by the consumers willingness to pay for it
socialism,removed,if there isnt a monopoly on the product the company willing to give the most competitive price will win out in the end
socialism,removed,because things cost money medicine isnt magic it costs money to develop produce and deliver the real problem with your slaverymedicine analogy was that slavery was an inefficient business model a motivated sharecropper working for pay is far more productive than a slave bound to the land the whole point of capitalism which built the world you live in is that you have to work to pay for services you require if you make all essential services completely free food water housing utilities then why would you work and if no one worked who would pay taxes and if no one pays taxes who pays for the very services the government now provides
socialism,removed,nope these guys are demons they literally crawled out of hell to become corporate executives they sit in their highrises twirling their mustaches thinking how can we best make life harder for everyone and kill as many kids as we can its not like they have a legal fiduciary responsibility to their share holders to pursue the most profitable option in any opportunity theyre evil thats it
socialism,removed,the company also offers coupons on its website that can reduce costs this year for the first time bush was able to use those coupons and her good insurance plan to bring down her outofpocket costs to zero oh so they arent monsters
socialism,removed,the company also offers coupons on its website that can reduce costs this year for the first time bush was able to use those coupons and her good insurance plan to bring down her outofpocket costs to zero oh so they arent monsters
socialism,removed,in the case of the united states the government did not build the tools and they probably loaned him the money to go to the school where he learned how to use the tools he has to pay the government back he doesnt restrict you from making your own epipen you just like the doctor in the article can submit your version to the fda and sell it at a far more competitive price which is literally the perfect example of capitalism at work also they dont charge money for shits and gigs they have to charge as much as they can because of their legal fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders fuck the system yeah say that from the computer house and electricity the system created
socialism,removed,only if i dont jizz but damn it is hard i mean just look at capitalism with its sexy little ass oh man look at it inspire innovations that save lives jesus look at it bring billions out of poverty oh god oh god now i gotta change my pants
socialism,removed,theres also a problem with people trying to end all discussion by saying thats sexist without actually listening to what the other person is trying to say when theyre bringing up a valid issue people pull the thats sexistracistwhateverist card with far too much ease and thats the central problem that turns people off from the left these days i feel as though the rise of identity politics was just another way of dividing the middle class even though identity politics may have been of some use for certain movements people end up bickering over whos getting fucked over the most and missing the fact that were all getting fucked
socialism,removed,free market does
socialism,removed,can i ask just a favour can we please stop considering the crazy ones the bougie ones and the liberal ones feminists its every bit as bad if not worse than social democrats calling themselves socialistswe reject brocalists with a resounding not my comrade because they arent i fail to see how we cant all agree that these arent our sisters for the same reason brocalists arent brocalists fail to acknowledge genderrace issues bougie feminists fail to acknowledge class and often times race tis a case of go intersectional or go home every bit of it the fucking reactionaries are going to attack any weak points they can see they are reactionaries its what they do we need to fight them on it tooth and nail but we also need to strengthen feminism we are good at discussing the flaws of everything else in theory and making constructive criticism and thereby strengthening it we have no problem in denouncing socialist and communist crazies world wide but when it comes to feminists who are destroying the movement from within a soft panic as i like to call it sets in as long as thats true we cant strengthen the movement i have a relative young girl in her early she has been a feminist since her early teens this year she abandoned the movement its not that she doesnt believe men and women should be equal anymore its that she no longer believes in the people in the feminist movement and im trying to get her involved in marxist feminism but she is understandably wary of it if the feminist movement could loose her then its a poor sign im gradually making progress with her she is getting interested in marxism in general and hopefully might feel confident in feminism again soon from a marxist perspective but like brocalists these so called feminists are not our comrades and we need to start pushing the right kind of feminism the true kind of feminism you dont see us pushing for social democracy do you there is no reason why this cant be done anti racist groups are not plagued with the same problems to as large a degree its salvageable but its us who have to do it it has to be done we cant have a revolution without feminism
socialism,removed,youre right there are very few crazies but unfortunately they are the most attention demanding people will choose the person ranting and raving about nonsense over the calm collected person making good points its built into us to be sudden aware of loud brash things its a survival technique and unfortunately when you dont know about a topic in this case feminism you will gravitate towards the source of medium that will give you a shot gun blast of the simplest way to understand it in this case tweets and youtube videos of someone making passionate and unfiltered statements i remember i went to a prochoice rally held in dublin it was very nice good crowd both female and male so a speaker comes on and she makes good points and then another and another finally we get to one who basically just says men know your place and starts saying how abortion is a female issue and men supporting prochoice shouldnt be acknowledged or attempted to help well unfortunately things turned into a shit show after that the facebook page for the event turned into one big ass hat thing about oh men are ruining this because they had their feelings hurt and youre a hypocrite for supporting a sexist statement like that i kept out of this but felt so sorry for not only the other speakers organizers and people who turned up who were willing to overlook the statement to focus on the more important issue of prochoice rights but also for anyone who may have felt like they could help out but were now put off by this whole shit show both the statement and the infighting i consider myself a feminist as any decent person would but my own parents especially my mother dont to them feminism is still the whole burning bras and hating men thing as it was in their day i think the only way to combat it is to just always be the one willing to get burned for the sake of getting as many people interested as possible most people are feminists they just dont realize you win people over by getting them to understand it makes sense its in their best interests and that its just a word for what they already believe like for example im not really versed in on feminism can anyone give me some insight the fact you cared about such an issue want to learn more and see it as important thats a very feminist thing to do good on you
socialism,removed,well duh youre a leftcom
socialism,removed,market socialism aka capitalism with a lot of coops
socialism,removed,lets rename this sub to rsagp
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,i disagree
socialism,removed,yeah
socialism,removed,no youre a rapist
socialism,removed,define liberal arts major
socialism,removed,but im not defending the blockade ive thought it was wrongheaded at least since we started doing business in vietnam but ill be glad to hammer trump for recognizing the illegality of breaking the blockade and doing it anyway and ill be glad to hammer the conservatives for their hypocrisy in defending both the wrongheaded law and the criminal who broke that law
socialism,removed,there is nothing more sad in the world then a stem student ripping on a liberal arts major for picking an education in low demand can you hear from up there
socialism,removed,there is no hypocrisy in the librals condemning that i mean yes there is considering they support their own bourgeois assholes who dont really give a shit about exploitation or legal status
socialism,removed,seems alright the one thing i am sick of is the whiteblack dichotomy like there will be a movement for black people that has a white wing or vice versa when will people realize there are more types of people in this world than just white and black people anyway still seems cool
socialism,removed,modern industry it proclaimed had revolutionized the world it surpassed in its accomplishments all the great civilizations of the pastthe egyptian pyramids the roman aqueducts the gothic cathedrals its innovationsthe railroad the steamship the telegraphhad unleashed fantastic productive forces in the name of free trade it had knocked down national boundaries lowered prices made the planet interdependent and cosmopolitan goods and ideas now circulated everywhere just as important it swept away all the old hierarchies and mystifications people no longer believed that ancestry or religion determined their status in life everyone was the same as everyone else for the first time in history men and women could see without illusions where they stood in their relations with others im pretty sure i was shaddowbanned on my other account for saying this mods wouldnt give me a reason for banning me but the last thing i said in this sub was something similar too this to say that capitalism isnt a improvement over feudalism is totally dismissing dialectics
socialism,removed,lol all comments were deleted yikes
socialism,removed,why the graveyard
socialism,removed,i dont think thats what the comments were about based on the few i saw
socialism,removed,and you would be right it was supposed to be a representative republic until the rich and the politicians found a way to game the system still we love to hate the united states until you compare it to virtually any other country then we love the united states of america
socialism,removed,truueee
socialism,removed,we must fight these reactionaries with organised force youre a fat retard who couldnt organize enough force to take down a class on a playground
socialism,removed,talking about censorship of rpolitics is okay in rsocialism but not rthedonald is real
socialism,removed,maybe because girls dont want to be surrounded by fat sweaty neckbeards like the average socialist
socialism,removed,there is never a good time to use violence against someone over a difference of political opinion im disgusted you have a single upvote trump is a far cry from hitler or any true form of fascism hes an opportunistic right winger who is essentially an american version of silvio berlusconi his methods are loathsome and many of his followers have extreme views but not a single element within his campaign has even come close to acquesing to the whims of those extremists the hitler analogy is a sure fire way to pick apart the rational antitrump people and the preposterous reactionaries if youre really advocating what it sounds like youre advocating you are just as vile as the worst elements of the trump base
socialism,removed,hitler was likely the greatest socialist to ever live nothing will stop our movement we must fight the trump supporters not with words but violence keep up the good work and feel the bern
socialism,removed,hitler was likely the greatest socialist to ever live nothing will stop our movement we must fight the trump supporters not with words but violence keep up the good work and feel the bern
socialism,removed,hitler was likely the greatest socialist to ever live nothing will stop our movement we must fight the trump supporters not with words but violence keep up the good work and feel the bern
socialism,removed,its almost like this happens everywhere where any time socialism is tried it fails miserably every single time
socialism,removed,thread
socialism,removed,can we get anonymous to hack their sub
socialism,removed,i mean i pretty much assumed i was gonna get banned lol
socialism,removed,on the pavement
socialism,removed,this was done in venezuela chavez seized companies in all sectors in the industry now they produce less and most of them are in technical bankruptcy source im venezuelan living in venezuela
socialism,removed,there is no reason the poor guy cant clean the junk of his floor
socialism,removed,im surprised rich areas of venezuela are stocked with caviar nutella and champagne this has to change mercal should be also able to offer these so important goods to the working class stop class warfare oh theres no government regulated goods in there i dont see any of the basic goods either why would that be oh i remember because the expropiated factories dont work anymore and the price regulations meant to favor the poor are idiotic because no one is going to make of flour if after selling they lose money and banned ill wear both as badges of honor
socialism,removed,why would we want you to be shut down
socialism,removed,there is the exact same convenient alliance happening in rhillaryforprison trump supporters and berniebots opening cooperating to fight against what they see a larger evil whats your point
socialism,removed,that time donald trump nearly won the election and how his followers took to the internet to promote islamophobia and racism lol oh you silly billy phobias are irrational fears theres nothing irrational about not wanting my sisters clitoris hacked off or of bellends like anjem choudary telling me i cant buy beer because the store owner happens to pray to mecca
socialism,removed,fucking bastards im tired of this already im tired of your fuking bullshit here is a venezuelan speaking and yeah currently living in venezuela and no not rich paying less than a dollar a month for a shitty internet connection and knowing english doesnt make me rich that store has all that food because it is not regulated by the government so they can import it and put it any price they want that means they can import it using black market dollars and then put it the price at that rate and not the official because the government doesnt give them dollars at the imaginary official rate but basic food rice flour etc and basic goods are regulated using the official rate which is like the black market rate and as i know some of you will still think theyre criminals because theyre using black market rate its the only way to get dollars and bring food because government doesnt sell and doesnt let anyone else sell if its not at their again imaginary rate for that reason basic goods are vanished in venezuela and obviously as minimum wage and almost everything related to salaries is calculated with the official rate just the rich are able to buy the imported nonregulated products and thus you find them in the rich areas and not in the poor areas you arent even from here why the fuck do you keep trying to defend this shitty government you arent the ones suffering this crisis you just make it worse trying to deny it without knowing whats really happening just because the government shares your same ideology well fuck you fuck socialism fuck rsocialism and fuck maduro
socialism,removed,oh man the arm chair socialist back at it again so comfortable and happy to say socialism is great when you live in a capitalist country with all the benefits of finding everything you want meanwhile here we cant find shit and if we find it its expensive as hell but do not worry in the end socialism is
socialism,removed,not sure which of the two would be more of a setback trump or hillary
socialism,removed,just talk to people one on one pm they need a crowd to troll and if you take away the crowd they become self aware and might listen to you
socialism,removed,try to pm them without a crowd to entertain they are unable to show boat to the rthedonald hive mind and are much more reasonable
socialism,removed,first of all violence in trump rallies is rampant they beat up protesters all the time even if that were true its a red herring this is about your total approval for violence against innocent people so long as it achieves your political goal they engage in racist and fascistic movement that creats hatred and racism and discrimimation if those people get what they want and put trump in power the police wouls be the one commiting violence against minorities and those protesters proof in regards to the racism and the fascism and the violence and stuff wheres your proof for all of this its undeniable that trump himself has expressed bigoted and racist views proof and sure they have human rights so they dont go flying out the window just because they think differently from you great then killing innocent people is wrong no matter what your political goal is rights are rights no matter what you think of the person or their beliefs it feels like youre forgetting that this is people were talking about here real live flesh and bone human beings you cant just reduce a human to racist or fascist and therefore youre justified in dehumanizing them that now how this works thats now how any of this works wouldnt you agree ots a just cause fighting racism and fascism is certainly a just cause i cant disagree with that the problem is violence towards innocent people especially peaceful ones who are just attending a rally of a person that happens to think differently than you how do you suggest people to fight aggainst fascism then if violence is the only answer at that time then violencebut not violence against innocent people who just happen to think differently than me thats just stupid go after the real targets not innocent bystanders not that im encouraging violence im just following the though experiment its not a matter of different views as you dishonestly present it yes it is these trump supporters are just some dudes who happen to think differently than you come on now we both know trump is not hitler we both know trump is not trying to commit genocide or wipe out an entire species or take over the world come on now attacking these trump supporters just because they want to vote for somebody different than you is absurd i dont reject violent protest on principle which we are arguing now i reject it because its a bad tactic on which we both agree how on earth is violence against innocent people morally justifiable the ends justify the means then youre gonna run into the problems i mentioned earlier like with that thought experiment about bombing germany
socialism,removed,weve been there done that and all the replacements the goverment did with members of the working class have been a total failure
socialism,removed,what happened to free speech
socialism,removed,naw ill stick with the original phrasing is it wrong to inflict violence on innocent people do the ends justify the means can we spill the blood of innocent people simply because they think differently and vote differently than us we both know the obvious answer here of course violence on innocent people is evil no matter how fancy you want to make your language sound this is what youre getting at and its wrong iidoes trump represent an extreme case like the nazi case which requires the use of violence against his protesters to stop him see heres another issue why assume violence is necessary and even if violence is necessary then theres no reason to inflict violence on innocent people who just happen to think and vote differently than you inflict it where it counts again not condoning violence just following the thought experiment i understand your concern but i dont believe by accepting violent protest you open the door for extreme form of violenceas ive said before i think violence is a dangerous issue and needs to be argued for carefully and certainly needs justification do the ends justify the means yes or no if yes these extremes you wish to avoid applies since they run with your logic if no then you cant justify inflicting violence on innocent people so whats the general rule if the supporters are part of a movement thot propagates fascism and racism so to you if one holds these views they are essentially subhuman human rights and dignity go out the window and violence is totally okay to inflict on them even though they are law abiding civilians who just want to attend a rally and partake in the democratic process you realize youre talking about actual human beings here right a difference of thought justifies this violence to you even though you really want to avoid admitting this thats disgusting he called people coming from mexico rapists and criminals source show me direct quotes please its important because people get quote mined all the time he called for a ban on all muslims entering the us source show me direct quotes please its important because people get quote mined all the time by the way louis farrakhan the leader of the nation of islam endorses trump he refused to disavow david duke in a full minutes in an interview source also even if this happened that doesnt mean hes a racist or a fascist thats imply invalid reasoning
socialism,removed,i admire what hugo chavez stood for what he managed to achieve and the legacy he left making his daughter a multibillionaire ok
socialism,removed,so chavezs daughter is a capitalist
socialism,removed,youre foolish if you believe that some stores in venezuela are overstocked
socialism,removed,this is just the author projecting none of this is real
socialism,removed,lol rsocialism you are vastly overestimating your own importance i browse thedonald daily and cant remember a single circumstance when any one even mentioned this sub no one is brigading this backwater why bother its completely irrelevant shit the only reason im here is cause i just love watching venezuela falling apart your members defence of the failing economic policies is the most hilarious thing on reddit to me i love reading the opinions of you backwards motherfuckers its great fun keep being weird rsocialism
socialism,removed,its not a waste of money because money is there to purchase the things you want to buy if he was on his last dollar then yeah because you need that money theyre not shunned for it at least in the west relatively poor people because the working class in the west arent in absolute poverty drink all the time and clubs and bars specifically cater to them with cheap alcohol theyre not expected to live life without enjoyment if they were then most of the entertainment industry wouldnt exist in fact and this isnt a good thing either rich people want poor people to buy shit so they can get their money
socialism,removed,its amazing how delusional you are
socialism,removed,no its cheap because they know it will get them drunk and make them spend more alcohol doesnt make you docile at all it makes a lot of people violent and it causes them to stay off work bcause theyre hungover
socialism,removed,as far as britain goes people have always done that since before mercentalism was even a thing as far back as the reason being that alcohol doesnt spoil as fast is sterile and because it gives you calories people needed back then to survive
socialism,removed,i have literally made counter arguments to everything you said here no you really havent all youve tried to do is dress up your language to make it not look as disgusting but its still the same thing the use of vionce and to what extent wont magicaly extend to bombing peopleit has to be argued for proportionaly to the situation at hand this ignores the argument i gave about the implications of the ends justifying the means yet you keep claiming they are without giving arguments back at my reasoning the proof is right there is the videos at san jose these are mere people who wanted to attend a political rally and vote for trump theres no reason to assume as you have been that these people are racist or fascist the burden is on you innocent until proven guilty im on my phone now i cant provide links a minute of google search youll find the quotes no im not going to do your homework for you you make the claims so the burden is on you i want direct quotes so we can see if youre quote mining or not
socialism,removed,socialism state
socialism,removed,are you from venezuela mate just curious
socialism,removed,op and the people who upvoted certainly think it was manufactured really disappointed with yall right now
socialism,removed,socialism is for lazy people to mooch off of others success
socialism,removed,yeah all you did here was just rant about your personal feelings about me facts dont care about your feelings ive addressed your disgusting reasoning and shown it for what it is you can dress it up in fancy vocabulary all day but we both know whats going on here youre endorsing violence against people who happen to think differently than you you want to police thought thats disgusting trump on mexico thanks for providing the video so we can see clearly that youre quote mining he doesnt seem to be saying anything racist or fascist hes merely claiming there is a disproportionate amount of crime coming from a particular population theres nothing racist or fascist about statistics trump on muslim ban ah more quote mining we can see that he didnt call for a ban on all muslims entering the us you stopped short he called for a shut down of muslims entering the us until our representatives can figure out whats going on and what we should do thats perfectly rational and sane and democratic even louis farrakhan the leader of the nation of islam endorses trump on this idea trump refusing to disavow david duke in an interview wow we can definitely see that you have distorted the facts here he clearly states that he doesnt know anything about david duke and so he doesnt want to make a judgment out of ignorance sounds like something a sane and rational person would do alright so looks like you have no leg to stand on
socialism,removed,lolz i thought socialists take the guns from the people not provide them silly socialists
socialism,removed,you should examine your racism against whites it should not be tolerated
socialism,removed,they want to incite us to get us shutdown some of them have been honest about it this is a retaliation because we helped shutdown reuropean this is some funny stuff
socialism,removed,by being fascist oh wait
socialism,removed,you are actually defending trump calling mexicans criminals and rapist he didnt say mexicans are criminals and rapists he doesnt seem to be saying anything racist or fascist in this video at all hes merely claiming that there is a disproportionate amount of crime coming from a particular population theres nothing racist or fascist about statistics if i told you that straight while males disproportionately commit particular white collar crimes would you say thats racist too of course not were just talking about facts facts arent racist his policy of banning an entire people because of their religion we can see that he didnt call for a ban on all muslims entering the us you stopped short he called for a shut down of muslims entering the us until our representatives can figure out whats going on and what we should do thats perfectly rational and sane and democratic even louis farrakhan the leader of the nation of islam endorses trump on this idea let alone defending the lies of his when he said he doesnt know david duke in order to evade disavowing him while he actually talked shit on david duke back in the early so clearly he does know him where is your proof youre just assuming hes lying where is your evidence for your assertion here
socialism,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
socialism,removed,maybe the mods could create surveys for them and govern the sub accordingly
socialism,removed,ukcsocialist upoblachtobrithe uanonsocialist
socialism,removed,overstocked sure hold that thought and come live here for a while and think again
socialism,removed,a joke is always ok no matter what the topic its only a joke
socialism,removed,in the similar vein the stalinmao killed bajillion people ahahahah needs to stop we get it the numbers killed by those regimes are probably inflatedinaccurate you know who also does that shit to delegitimaize masskillings fucking neonazis
socialism,removed,fascists need to fucking die
socialism,removed,yeah youre stupid
socialism,removed,such a great book
socialism,removed,berned out ok
socialism,removed,is she using coercive force to take their labor from them no alright than
socialism,removed,so does socialism always need to be in a war with someone
socialism,removed,well id shoot him because hes donald trump you can always school ordinary people
socialism,removed,why do we have a stickied attack thread for rthedonald and not one for rhillaryclinton
socialism,removed,derp herp im so smart
socialism,removed,might as well theres a reason libertarian has more subs
socialism,removed,are you trying implying the ussr was a good thing hahahahahahahahahahaha
socialism,removed,you are children throwing a fit because you dont like the outcome of something e will be president get over it you whiny babies
socialism,removed,cuz i told a trump supporter to kill himself
socialism,removed,please stop using the word liberals in a general sense like that i consider myself liberal and a socialist why the hell spit on the people who would be most likely to agree with you i get that thats what some may do to you but returning the favor is immature
socialism,removed,socialism doesnt work

socialism,removed,i dont mind be down voted with discussion i hate being down voted with discussion
socialism,removed,itt commies upset that someone who actually knows how awful their ideology is doesnt support them fucking glorious
socialism,removed,checking this sub was the first thing i thought to do when i saw that ama the butthurt is more glorious than i could have hoped
socialism,removed,pop socialism is not a threat to the status quo lmao besides you guys drove off all the pop socialists with your constant disparaging of sanders and his supporters and made sure theyd want fuck all to do with actual socialism nicely done
socialism,removed,sure but jill steins policy were hurt many members of the working class who cant bear the high taxes and would simply increase burdens of businesses which prevents workers from getting jobs outsourcing outsourcing outsourcing also unlike stein he actually has a chance to win which will clear the path for other alternative politicians to make it through tldr he will protect civil liberties and in the long run create an atmosphere where socialists can succeed
socialism,removed,askhistorians might be the best damn subreddit on this site if you find yourself thinking their awful about something youre probably eating from the trashcan of ideology too much
socialism,removed,rawr nuzzles how are you pounces on you youre so warm notices you have a bulge o someones happy nuzzles your necky wecky murr hehehe rubbies your bulgy wolgy youre so big oooo rubbies more on your bulgy wolgy it doesnt stop growing ·· kisses you and lickies your necky daddy likies nuzzles wuzzles i hope daddy really likes wiggles butt and squirms i want to see your big daddy meat wiggles butt i have a little itch wags tail can you please get my itch puts paws on your chest nyea its a seven inch itch rubs your chest can you help me pwease squirms pwetty pwease sad face i need to be punished runs paws down your chest and bites lip like i need to be punished really good paws on your bulge as i lick my lips im getting thirsty i can go for some milk unbuttons your pants as my eyes glow you smell so musky v licks shaft mmmm so musky drools all over your daddy meat i like fondles mr fuzzy balls hehe puts snout on balls and inhales deeply oh god im so hard licks balls punish me daddy nyea squirms more and wiggles butt i love your musky goodness bites lip please punish me licks lips nyea suckles on your tip so good licks pre of your cock salty goodness eyes role back and goes balls deep mmmm moans and suckles
socialism,removed,i have every right to defend myself physically holy shit id pay to see a halfgay middle class asian teenager trying to defend himself physically
socialism,removed,denounce state surveillance a country with no need for it other than to keep the people completely brainwashed advocate for it in another just because it aligns with his ideology his ideology the reason we need surveillance in the west is because we let so many muslims mexicans and blacks in the have garbage ideologies regarding women gays minorities animals its sunni muslims that have the ideology we need to protect against its muhammad sa allahu alayhi wa sallam that has the ideology you should fear
socialism,removed,not sure why this sub supports corbyn and bourgeois elections maybe because its just rliberal at this point at least he supports rehabilitating the traitor trotsky though
socialism,removed,theres no such thing as a personality cult surrounding socialist leaders this is liberal and reactionary propaganda
socialism,removed,it breeds ignorance believing in things with zero evidence is crazy life is shallow when you dont seek the truth youve never talked to god or seen it so you actually dont know the truth religion undermines academics which is based on science the bible is a horribly violent ignorantsexiest full of bigotry and shit morals christians just pick and choose whatever suits their agenda and are hypocrites religion has been a force to get us to where we are today but we are smart enough to know its only holding us back now it needs to be abolished and it will be its just a matter of time
socialism,removed,heres my favourite bible verse its from deuteronomy if a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband and a man find her in the city and lie with her then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city and ye shall stone them with stones that they die the damsel because she cried not being in the city and the man because he hath humbled his neighbours wife so thou shalt put away evil from among you
socialism,removed,is this about the ableism announcement on the front page if so then yes that kind of political correctness is counterproductive
socialism,removed,i agree with everything youve said but i think what im getting at is more about practice than theory i mean if we asked a trump voter for a description of a stereotypical bernie sanders supporter i think it would have no mention of the economic side of leftist politics my guess is that theyd be more likely to describe them as a kind of thought police say anything about terrorism and youre islamophobic say anything about housewives or a chairman and youre sexist this kind of thing i think people feel like the left as a whole wants people to be walking on eggshells with regard to these issues like we want people to selfcensor their thoughts on important issues to avoid accidentally being racist or sexist as if that were possible

socialism,removed,lol you guys look like tools scrawny asian kids good luck
socialism,removed,they look exactly how i imagines they would a bunch of scrawny nu male manlets plus the one obese ham in the background
socialism,removed,i think if there was any sort of armed revolution it would never be a full uprising a full scale revolution against the most powerful military the world has ever know by far would be futile an armed revolution would be a mixture of mass shootings bombings and assassinations its the only way small arms could possibly take on the state
socialism,removed,looks like all armed dems in texas are brave with covered faces and arms bought with shillings
socialism,removed,openly threatening people and brandishing weapons with masks on in public but were the fascists ayyyy
socialism,removed,also if youre not into we recommend you carry an elephant gun for third wave feminists fat has been known to be natures kevlar

socialism,removed,lol
socialism,removed,thats not true
socialism,removed,actually that is a lie id be surprised if you could argue that stalin was not a facist or various other communist far left facist dictators
socialism,removed,isnt that what this sub is all about
socialism,removed,so afraid they hide their face
socialism,removed,wearing face masks and carrying assault rifles is certainly going to turn the average man to your cause go you
socialism,removed,im not a right winger but i fully support everyones right to own any gun freedom should apply to everyone not just people i disagree with
socialism,removed,i wouldnt be a right winger if the left would stop trying to pass retarded gun laws and generally fuck the constitution up i think breaking the antigun conditioning of the left making them realize that an armed womanminoritylgbtdisabled cant be victimized making them realize how dumb gun control is in turn making them realize that the feinsteins they vote for are idiots will result in a more reasonable left
socialism,removed,ask reagan cant tell if retarded or if you think that was clever somehow fuck trump but youre taking that quote so far out of context if you cant win an argument without misinformation you cant win
socialism,removed,i dont know if there is a sign warning of the consequences of trespassing then its kind of on the trespasser for ignoring that

socialism,removed,can i have your stuff
socialism,removed,mmm i want a topo chico now
socialism,removed,i always love how privileged college kids always manage to look so trendy while advocating for a planned economy that doesnt waste resources that could be used clothing the poor and freezing to death i remember at my university we used to have a girl who would unironically dress up in her pristine several hundred dollar punk getup with her knee high docs pretorn denim jacket and carefully curated and sewn patches to scream at me through a microphone about the evils of exploiting the working class to marginally improve my life with audacious and pointless displays of wealth
socialism,removed,yall leftists are a fkn crazy as the right
socialism,removed,you mad bro
socialism,removed,lol this is so cringy id bet those are airsoft guns with the tips painted exactly what i would expect collegeaged edgy leftist nutjobs to look like or rsocialism subscribers

socialism,removed,say nigger and ill shoot you i have no idea
socialism,removed,its almost as if someone posted a picture of people with guns holding a sign saying make racists afraid again referencing the campaign slogan of the president elect who half the country voted for
socialism,removed,youre not very clever are you
socialism,removed,kovalev got robbed ward clearly didnt do enough to win
socialism,removed,not true
socialism,removed,trespassing doesnt become ethical just because theres a sign warning you not to do it
socialism,removed,your world view is riddled with fallacies
socialism,removed,so youre gonna shoot racists lol ok are there any fucking sane people left fuck me giving each other tips on which rounds to buy if theres a revolution infowars level delusion ban me we but is this really where you guys are at should i be worried my grandparents are gonna get shot by school shooters anonymous up there for a tasteless remark grow up this shit isnt progress of any kind
socialism,removed,from australia and im all for a revolution but this is fucking insane what is it with you people and guns yeah you people what the fuck is your obsession with carrying guns parading guns around in public to make a political point are you aware what this looks like to the rest of the sane world
socialism,removed,im conservative and i think everyone should have guns however i dont think you should threaten people with gun violence for being racist
socialism,removed,its okay im sure hell have a debate and you guys can exchange ideas like adults maybe over pm since the mods dont like dissenting opinions socialism more like fascism
socialism,removed,did you just assume their ideology
socialism,removed,that kind of retaliatory justification is a cancerous rhetoric
socialism,removed,nothing says i stand for a cause like covering your face
socialism,removed,yeh there is something about a bunch of grotesquely overweight middle aged guys in military surplus gear that doesnt intimidate me too much
socialism,removed,i have no problem with open carrying and protesting but i think when you do both at the same time its considered something different and should be illegal
socialism,removed,no he didnt
socialism,removed,an insane country
socialism,removed,lol looks like a bunch of highschool kids found their parents guns
socialism,removed,it is texas
socialism,removed,because theyre dumb
socialism,removed,lol the dallas shooter used an sks which shoots ammo cops didnt stand a chance ripped through their bulletproof vests that are designed to stop pistol ammo you are talking about a nato round which is actually the same as a while youre firing plentiful pussy ammo like that during your revolution i will be ripping through your vests with ease
socialism,removed,nothing screams young liberal austinite like a man clutching to his topo chico
socialism,removed,if they stand behind the courage of their convictions their masks would not be necessary makes them look thuggish and afraid
socialism,removed,theyre all teenagers
socialism,removed,nice hoods these kids are wearing i think ive seen them somewhere before
socialism,removed,you guys are fucking retarded is there no sanity left in america step back breathe in and talk to each other and dont fuel this useless hatred there is no revolution going to happen this post is absolutly delusional
socialism,removed,racism is a state of mind not a physical action if it results in violence then that is violence which makes you perfectly correct to defend yourself threatening people for holding opinions is stupid and quite frankly antiintellectual you also assumed im white displaying your prejudice towards the situation
socialism,removed,yeah this group pictured looks so strong and threatening
socialism,removed,so isnt this race thing the kind of stuff that marx was talking about why are these people opposed to a huge portion of the working class are they talking about real racism as in discrimination or prejudice based on race or is this the borders are racist crew so many questions
socialism,removed,looks like a world of warcraft guild crashed call of duty lol
socialism,removed,i havent moved shit getting sour because i played your own game interesting
socialism,removed,so let me get this straight you all are in support of a socialist economy and you arent joking about it
socialism,removed,irony much
socialism,removed,because they have very poor knowledge of history
socialism,removed,thats blasphemy
socialism,removed,get used to it
socialism,removed,its like they are trying to be a parody of postutopian socialistic society theyre like mini north korea after the soviet union and china stopped propping them up any disagreement and you get banned sent to labor camps
socialism,removed,oh god this is not satire is it
socialism,removed,you kids are a bunch of liberal safe space pursues
socialism,removed,i live in texas i can only see conservatives laughing at these guys
socialism,removed,and were the fascists
socialism,removed,make racists afraid we say with covered faces out of fear of being identified
socialism,removed,i come in peace came over here to see what you all were saying about these guys actually im glad to see some left wing nuts respecting the probably going to go out there and talk to them and get them involved in some of our shooting sports here i havent seen any of these hipster looking kids around the range or matches fyi on the right wing of politics and esp gun rights we dont really like our own open carry demonstrators either it is way too hard to keep gun rights intact in this country esp without using the firearm itself as a political tool
socialism,removed,youre inherently an idiot
socialism,removed,you guys are on a new level of paranoid i have not seen in any other sub
socialism,removed,dont be fooled this is an ad for that amazing topo chico the guy is holding
socialism,removed,so they want to use the second amendment to infringe on the first
socialism,removed,americans support guns in everyones hands left right neutral leftists only want guns in their own hands the first thing socialists did in russia china north korea etc was to seize peoples guns you might want to read history pal
socialism,removed,the evil right wing hillbillies arent after you bud im sorry to break it to you
socialism,removed,youre not very clever are you i never said you did
socialism,removed,of course one of them is drinking topo chico
socialism,removed,of course private property is evil and only the state can own property s
socialism,removed,lol wat
socialism,removed,im subscribed to this sub but its also because of the stupid and inflammatory notion on the far left that being against illegal immigration makes you racist
socialism,removed,theres a difference between open carry and inciting violence this is inciting violence not much different than the rest of the reactions weve seen from the left since the election but still its grossly inappropriate and borderline illegal
socialism,removed,of course by racist they mean anyone they dont agree with
socialism,removed,looks like a retarded cobra commander
socialism,removed,i wonder if they know that russians are super racist
socialism,removed,corruption is human nature the leaders of any socialist society will by nature tend to be people looking to abuse the system you will never find a socialist utopia that doesnt eventually crumble due to base human nature
socialism,removed,they know their beliefs are dumb so they try and hide who they are
socialism,removed,kumrads die because theyre told kumrads die before theyre old kumrads arent afraid to die kumrads dont and kumrads wont believe in lifeand death knows whie all good kumrads you can tell by their altruistic smell moscow pipes good kumrads dance kumrads enjoy sfreud knows whoy the hope that you may mess your pance every kumrad is a bit of quite unmitigated hate travelling in a futile groove god knows why and so do i because they are afraid to love
socialism,removed,stop youre getting in the way of our revolution
socialism,removed,pathetic
socialism,removed,dude you look like a tool when you say that you assumed his race out of nowhere and hes speaking on principles nothing to do with race stop with this racist bullshit
socialism,removed,if there were a leftist revolution i would sure as hell hope it was against the as opposed to dumb racist rednecks
socialism,removed,i personally doubt very much that these people have any extensive knowledge or training about the weapons they are holding if they want a revolutioncivil war against conservatives they are good to have a bad time many conservatives a literally been preparing most of their life for a potential war in america these kids in the picture probably just recently picked these guns up
socialism,removed,they look exactly like i thought they would look
socialism,removed,revolution begins in the voting booth or at the level of grassroots support for more community programs however the prior posters thoughts are likely prompted by the picture in this post which if you remember correctly is a bunch of guntoting people with antiteargas preparations and gang rags covering their faces i dont know how cold it is right now in texas but one thing ill give to the yall quaeda guys way back when they didnt hide their faces yes in communism youre supposed to be disposable and all the same so facial differentiation shouldnt matter but our current system really prizes faces che guevara didnt get famous for refusing to let his face be seen all the rags tell me is that this is a bunch of affluenzaafflicted youth who will be first on the firing line if what they want ever came to power they want to be able to take off the rags and return to a normal society meaning their normal society is much better than their protest environment so these ones are selfstyled guerrillas with guns who would want to shoot at cops and soldiers in the street its not that the posters here have misconceptions about a socialist revolution its that the people in the image have misconceptions about a communist one
socialism,removed,im sorry is this the socialist subreddit or the idiot subreddit every nation on earth has laws and immigration policies
socialism,removed,soooo they are cowards
socialism,removed,point me to a single instance in history where a socialist country has not gone the way of animal farm with a class of people becoming more equal than others never mind one that permitted widespread private gun ownership and open carry wearing the hammer sickle while protesting with rifles is supreme irony
socialism,removed,please get into my oven
socialism,removed,hahaha this thread is cringe af college students paying a year talking about capitalism and revolution while hiding behind masks and openly calling to murder making them sooo much better than the nazis socialism
socialism,removed,find out more how computers and basically any innovation was a product of free market competition not of govorment telling people how much they should spend
socialism,removed,nazis national socialists that doesnt sound very conservative to me
socialism,removed,need for what
socialism,removed,is it ok to threaten people with violence for what the beloved now are they threatening just white racists or racists of all creed and color or is it only ok to intimidate white people
socialism,removed,pretty sure those guys have a hammer and sickle on their faces and ive seen plenty of sugar coating here about the ussr over the last few years
socialism,removed,next youre going to tell us you cant be racist against white people
socialism,removed,and tellme these people arent fascists they cover their faces ffs lol leftists are really something else a cancer that needs to be extinguished
socialism,removed,so what is the implication here theyre going to shoot racists in a public place
socialism,removed,dont they realize that a communist system would take away their guns
socialism,removed,what would i be considered as if im not really a liberal but also dont wanna be involved in any revolution
socialism,removed,so you want to fight the government so you can have more government
socialism,removed,i love how all the most downvoted comments here that were probably mocking them is deleted its just sooooo ironic
socialism,removed,haahahhahahahaahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha
socialism,removed,literally nothing you mentioned is discrimination or prejudice based on race muslim isnt a race neither is illegal mexican immigrant its definitely not definately
socialism,removed,these people have never touched a hammer or sickle in their entire life i can assure you
socialism,removed,why the fuck are they wearing masks
socialism,removed,you mean the number of assaults that have so far been proven to have been faked for attention
socialism,removed,ive heard of far far more reports of trump supporters being beaten assaulted threatened than i have trump supporters going off as a racist both during and after the election campaign in fact an overwhelming majority of the trump supporters do racist thing to me stories ive heard as so farfetched or plainly illogical that i have to think that yet again its big media trying to cause panic and fear where there should be none just yesterday there was a big facebook thread in my local area about how some random muslim girl was minding her own businiess walking home when she was assaulted by rednecks who literally groped my because donald said it was ok all the while yelling racial slurs at me as they felt me up sorry but that shit isnt just randomly happening because trump became president and if it does happen it is no where and i mean no where near as widespread as mainstream media wants you to believe
socialism,removed,covering your face in public is illegal show yourselves you edgy faggot spoiled wannabe communists the us already spends of the budget on medicaid medicare and social security you are repugnant losers hahaha we have guns also
socialism,removed,these guys are opencarrying wearing face masks with the stated purpose of intimidating racists and you guys somehow see this as a good thing
socialism,removed,rkillthosewhodisagree
socialism,removed,conservative libertarian here voted johnson in sanders in primary i cant speak for anyone else but i have problem with these folks exercising their rights to carry like this i may not see eyetoeye with you folks on economic policy but i think the right to defend ones home and person are critical to the pursuit of life liberty and happiness im glad that youre taking your rights seriously and racists should definitely be reminded that well never have need to fear a resurgence of oldtime lynch mobs when good people are willing to look out for each other and keep our communities protected from bad people
socialism,removed,cringe
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,communists
socialism,removed,doesnt mean it is right to make such a bold assumption how do you know he has not been told by a member of black lives matter to kill himself or been exposed to hatred from another race you dont know this man
socialism,removed,the guy on the left is the only capable looking one imo
socialism,removed,lol one of those is an airsoft gun you cant make this shit up
socialism,removed,crazy rightwinger here id go to a range and then ask to try out a bunch of different models with the intent of buying one ergonomic fit features magazine capacity sights those all differ from model to model so fitting one to you is going to be up to you id recommend you check out the glock smith and wesson cz or really any cz theyre all great or go with a which has been in service for years for good reason folks will try to steer you towards one or another dont listen to them id only recommend that you dont go revolver because theyre antiquated designs and you can actually injure yourself quite badly if you have your fingers in the wrong place when you shoot were really not all bad people
socialism,removed,it really doesnt matter if youre left or right only the biggest dorks from either side open carry
socialism,removed,right winger here and i fully support these men exercising their right to carry as i hope they would mine
socialism,removed,this is not the image we should be projecting to the public one of intimidation and violence most people who could be sympathetic to our cause are going to look at this and either think that were edgy tryhards or were legitimately disturbing and scary people it alienates people who are on the fence and validates what our enemies say about us it gives them more ammo to label us as a threat overall violent revolution is unethical it ends up killing many who are more or less innocent and leads to atrocities it doesnt matter your political affiliation history has shown violence only breeds more violence later we need to work on improving our image peaceful protests pushing our lawmakers to be held accountable and to make good choices were not going to get anywhere by causing more pain and fear
socialism,removed,so funny
socialism,removed,tell me again of the weapon freedoms in socialist states of yore and present day if you dont comment ill take that as your full reply
socialism,removed,this is the most autistic thing ive ever seen
socialism,removed,plz tell me how people in russia suffered because of mindless who has the best dick money spending im from yugoslavia i lived in your fairytale and i still have healthcare and i live in a capitalist society i have free education as long as i do my studies plz tell me how you envision socialism as an utoia where money grows on trees and innovation is supressed because lowly educated workers must contain jobs the rule of mediocrity plz tell me how you dont know jack shit about other countries and continue living in your america the only country in the world echo chamber
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,i doubt these people own real guns they probably call magazines clips
socialism,removed,free market existed before socialism making your argument invalid back to liberal arts studies
socialism,removed,a few years from now this will be posted on rblunderyears
socialism,removed,i dont think youre getting the joke in that
socialism,removed,that last part of the answer makes a lot more sense to me im seeing a lot of comments saying something similar the way i see it very few people will see these guys and think oh no i feel threatenedintimatedetc by these protestors most people will see a group of younger obviously left leaning citizens taking an interest in the amendment the most off putting thing to me a right leaning libertarian is the communist imagery i understand the group isnt trying to promote any kind of solidarity with their right wing counterparts but i dont think they have anything to fear save for the most extreme of the gun toting open carry enthusiasts we see on the right i guess what im saying is i dont think they have anything to fear by showing their faces the government officials of the state of texas are not going to put you on some kind of watch list purely for owning a gun and having left leaning political views however i can understand that theres probably some crazy people that would see the communist imagery think that guy lives down the street from me and go vandalize property
socialism,removed,funny how every socialist country disarms its citizens for obvious reasons
socialism,removed,i bet these guys would be the first ones to run and hide if some actual shit went down
socialism,removed,hello rcringeanarchy
socialism,removed,thanks for confirming that youre not a threat to anyone
socialism,removed,only cowards and criminals hide their faces
socialism,removed,cringey idiots no one is scared of these pussies
socialism,removed,i assume they purchased those guns from a shop
socialism,removed,the right will wipe you out fairly soon
socialism,removed,rcringe
socialism,removed,cute these limp wristed numales would knock themselves out trying to fire that gun
socialism,removed,those guys are idiots they have muzzle barrels pointing at each others feet and are using uncommon ammunition i doubt they even know how to turn the safety off
socialism,removed,lol
socialism,removed,so im pretty sure this is flat out illegal due to the whole incitingthreat of violence angle to the whole thing standing on the corner with guns shouting about how racists cant scare you or something is fine saying get the racists out of our country while carrying weapons questionable but probably still legal saying a group of individuals should be afraid while you are carrying firearms yeah that wont take long for any judge to find that action as a threat of violence want to arm the left and right go for it its a fundamental right for all of us want to make sure the radical right know you wont stand for their shit thats fine be vocal about everything want to threaten violence and become a fear mongerer to achieve your goals yeah that is where you lose all sympathy from me
socialism,removed,the presidentelect has called for a national registry of muslims link to quote
socialism,removed,skinny teens with rifles and isisgrade soviet based uniforms are what id expect an alternate reality bernie sanders to inspire but for real theyre not wearing american colors it would be a shame if somebody thought this was a commie invasion
socialism,removed,make racists afraid again while wearing the flag of the most oppressive and genocidal regime to ever exist
socialism,removed,holding the sign proof girls can carry guns too or its just a guy with some nice legs
socialism,removed,communists with guns oh go no of course they carrying
socialism,removed,i wonder if they know that they wont get to keep their guns in a communist society
socialism,removed,ooooh scaaaarryy
socialism,removed,i mean its their right buy guess what under socialism you wouldnt be able to do that
socialism,removed,didnt the last place to have that logo have concentration camps didnt they fall pretty sharpish didnt they use violence and intimidation to force people into an ideology hmm
socialism,removed,yea lets take a country with an ingrained fear of socialism pair it up with its most known and despised symbols put it on our face and carry some guns around this is really going to help americans consider socialist ideals
socialism,removed,communism requires massive government to implement
socialism,removed,if you think members of the us military would be joining dipshits like the ones pictured and not a conservative militia in montana or georiga whos already been training a decade you are a fucking retard
socialism,removed,new age kkk
socialism,removed,hahahaha is this supposed to be intimidating why do you cowards need to hide your faces
socialism,removed,httpiimgurcomhikzftzjpg
socialism,removed,hahahawhen will you commies learntoo funny please provide more laughs thank you
socialism,removed,looks like a bunch of white men that hate white men
socialism,removed,i am the opposite of a socialist but i was always fascinated by how gun control took hold in the left nothing could be more counter to the idea of power to the people than wanting gun control
socialism,removed,i consider myself a socialist but this is ridiculous wtf are they trying to achieve with this
socialism,removed,oh nice do you think karls mark will sign my copy of the fountainhead too
socialism,removed,is this a new soros funded thing are people actually claiming racism i live a place youd expect racism but i havent seen any what on earth are these people mad about
socialism,removed,they look like complete tools one person could take them all out before they even figure out how to switch to f from s lmfao
socialism,removed,because critical thinking eludes them
socialism,removed,yeah why are they wearing full mask on arent they supposed to be proud
socialism,removed,wow thats terrifying man what would happen if a kkk member walked by
socialism,removed,this is embarrassing look at how they stand look at their posture look at their physique weaklings hiding behind guns thinking they make a difference they could never pull the trigger and even if they did they probably couldnt even control the recoil
socialism,removed,lol love the topo chico
socialism,removed,meanwhile at austin soviet headquarters
socialism,removed,exactly why you guys would get crushed instantly 😂😂 unlike you fags us on the right arent a bunch of pussies like yall and theres way more of us than there are of you and we are wayyyy better trained and prepared might i add in all seriousness dont kill yourselves cause thats exactly what will happen if you decide that just picking up a gun that looks cool for a revolution is a smart thing to do
socialism,removed,except thats not what happened here if you read the article the whitenationalist was attacked by an actual fascist protester
socialism,removed,anyone who dismisses the work of george orwells animal farm because it uses animals as an allegory is so stupid he isnt worth listening to
socialism,removed,go to bed kid
socialism,removed,is this article supposed to be taken seriously the hypocrisy here is amazing can we agree this shit has just turned into mudslinging with complete disregard for logic they are criticizing these people for doing exactly what they are doing attacking an exaggerated personification of what they see the enemy as altright you guys are fags this article how dare these womanabusing virgins call us fags
socialism,removed,did you not read my comment did you not read the article where did i lose you buddy
socialism,removed,you should leave the country with her
socialism,removed,dont worry you wont we will exterminate every last one of you to prevent the mistakes that have been made from ever occuring again
socialism,removed,over of the us is white most of the working middle class is white most tax payers are white the backbone of america is white
socialism,removed,mao are u fucking kidding me if killing million people is your goal then yeah
socialism,removed,if you dont like listening to the other side and you love to bash the fash so much then the only way it will be solved is with fighting then might makes right good to know better not lose then
socialism,removed,casually talking about killing white people just to bother them makes you no better than they are though thats fighting fire with fire and it only foments more fire
socialism,removed,youve got some anger issues dude your poor wife
socialism,removed,cyka blyat comrade idi nahui fuck all the capitalist pigs babushka
socialism,removed,did you feel that by undocumented immigrants they were talking about hispanics thus threatening your wife
socialism,removed,hillary and the dnc are fascists they are just using useful idiots to control everyone
socialism,removed,killed tens of millions of people put millions more into essentially slavery in work camps banned abortion criminalized homosexuality inspired antisemitic actions my greatgrandfather fought from moscow to berlin in wwii and was subsequently sent to a gulag for being jewish bureaucratized the government dismantled soviet councils and therefore actual democracy and so forth no shit and you still want me to support socialismcommunismfascism you people are retarded screw you and your socialism
socialism,removed,of course not socialists are antisemites not anti islam
socialism,removed,kindle exists purely due to capitalism ironic
socialism,removed,thats retarded
socialism,removed,wow you people are delusional keep dreaming morons
socialism,removed,you cant thats why socialism will never work
socialism,removed,in the comment above the only state mentioned is israel there are like countries in the world many of them oppressive regimes but no leftist always talk about israel first and foremost they are antisemites pure and simple
socialism,removed,trump is not a fullblown fascist and hillary will never pass any farleft legislation unless she is forced to
socialism,removed,exactly the same reason everyone else needs to be violently opposed in the streets because we as humans want blood we can never ever live without it and once the war is over everyone will realize how it was at the same time useless and useful this is the cycle of steel and there will be a point where nobody even remembers what the war was for if anything
socialism,removed,oh lolzies i didnt even notice this was a commie sub sorry stay laughable guys
socialism,removed,well commies are known to hate opinions lol
socialism,removed,plus she supports whats popular for the most part so she will probably pass at least some far left legislation you are deluded if you actually believe this also i dont see how a rightwinger masquerading as a leftist is somehow less destructive than a rightwinger being a rightwinger if anything it will just make people angry and push them to the right
socialism,removed,have i really just read an entire comment section cheering on attempted murder by molotov cocktail
socialism,removed,who said he was a victim of a violent crime and if hes been a victim of multiple violent crimes who is the common denominator
socialism,removed,im a member of the labour party i joined originally because of corbyn i loved that the party had shifted hugely to the left and was trying to engage in politics in a new way when he started his ratings were pretty poor as the tories were able to define him a loonyleft terrorist sympathiser which he did not contest i assumed things would look up but a combination of bad media handling and undermining from a small part of the party meant that his ratings never really recovered quite recently theres been a coup as you probably know which led into a leadership contest i initially supported corbyn but after hearing reports of incompetence and poor leadership from his former shadow cabinet colleagues and his fairly consistent cockups chakrabati peerage traingate etc as well as flatlining polls results have caused me to rather reluctantly vote for owen smith i will support him should he win and hopefully he can turn it around after winning which he is nearly guaranteed to do by becoming a stronger leader reassembling the shad cab and getting on top of the media but it seems unlikely as much as i would like to see proper hard left leader ill take any labour leader over the conservatives any day
socialism,removed,jesus that comment thread is toxic
socialism,removed,i dont know dismissing them feels a lot more productive to be quite honest
socialism,removed,this is absurd until we have the technology to produce everything needed without human input we need people to work
socialism,removed,help me understand without firms how do we get nice things like iphones or space exploration
socialism,removed,so your ideal world is a place where everyone just does things robots make everything and people do not pay for things they just take whatever they want definitely over simplifying but gist
socialism,removed,demsoc doesnt understand the labour theory of value notsurprisedjpg
socialism,removed,would you want scientists discovers cures to illnesses to just stop working once the revolution comes how about the farmers providing food engineers building infrastructure all of that is somehow not work according to him i dont understand this its all semantics it seems
socialism,removed,e calling for the abolition of the misery they are just a tool
socialism,removed,to be fair that sounds more primitivist than generally socialist or communist me i cant imagine workers needing to work the same hours under socialism but seeing as how production isnt fully automated yet people still gotta work
socialism,removed,im a communist
socialism,removed,thank you
socialism,removed,i fully understand the concerns people have about owen smith he has come out of nowhere saying that he now wants to follow suit in all of jeremys policies and acting as though hes been on the left of the party for all of his career however there has been a lot of character assassination regarding him hes not the most inspiring candidate and i dont know how far he can be trusted but at the end of the day he is a hard working lifelong labour man who did a lot of good work in the shadow cabinet the way cornyn has been treated by the party has been appalling and he was not given a fair chance by some elements therein but as much as i support his socialist ideals i just do not believe he can win a ge his polling has consistently been in the gutter and he has a sketchy history that the tories are going ruin him with come or possibly sooner im a prgmatist before im a socialist and the most right wing labour government will always be better than the most left wing conservative government winning is the most important thing
socialism,removed,who said anything about going from capitalism to communism the day after the revolution
socialism,removed,if only there was some way of knowing what causes pregnancy and how to avoid it alas it is a mystery to some what will these people do now with only three places left
socialism,removed,labour would still exist under socialism work would not
socialism,removed,reading this makes me firmdonald j
socialism,removed,dude you realize that the horrors of the industrial revolution are what inspired marx and engels
socialism,removed,i know they can be different but i also know they dont change overnight and we have to work to get there
socialism,removed,the hell of socialism is the state
socialism,removed,maybe you should go back and read what i wrote if thats what you think it means
socialism,removed,i cant speak for you but i enjoy my work the worst aspects of that being my lack of a voice in decision making and the lack of control over what we produce after the revolution which clearly wont ever happen because the left is too busy being more ideologue than thou to unite in any meaningful way i will seek to continue my work under radically different conditions if my shop is destroyed i will seek to build it again if my work is abolished by some revolutionary ruling class i will flee
socialism,removed,even without a currency i will still value some thing over some other thing
socialism,removed,democratic socialists are just social democrats without power
socialism,removed,as a firm believer in capitalism i dont get this part of socialism whats wrong with the market approach when it fails healthcare for instance you should probably regulate or nationalize but what is inherently wrong about a market creating say frozen orange juice
socialism,removed,democratic kampuchea is the ideal model for communism tbh everybody is forced to farm grains and rice at gunpoint by brother number one
socialism,removed,brilliant response from no doubt a brilliant mind
socialism,removed,fyi work the regimented and hierarchical forced employment where surplus labor is privatized by capital and the worker is commoditized labor the democratic organization of the proletariat to produce based on need democratic doesnt mean the ballot box
socialism,removed,do you know how many we are now
socialism,removed,this is the great thing about settlers the reactions it elicits from pettybourgois settlercolonials they always begin weeping and wailing and crying those crocodile tears when j sakai exposes the historical sins of the white working class and that the class nature of the american working class is parasiticism
socialism,removed,how mad are you going to be when trump wins by a landslide like
socialism,removed,fucking commies when will you realise socialism doesnt work capitalism and fascism are superior in every way but i dont have as much money as people who are more skilled and intelligent wahhhh fucking end yourself
socialism,removed,sanders spam isnt allowed
socialism,removed,i was a sound minded individual who believed in libertarianism i then i got into a terrible car accident which caused me permanent brain damage
socialism,removed,i think he was implying that capitalism uses the innate human selfishness to create selflessness socialism uses the innate human selflessness to create selfishness
socialism,removed,httpwwwthepoliticalinsidercombreakingnewlydiscoveredlettershillaryclintonsaulalinskymarxistcommunityorganizer obama and clinton are trying to bring in socialism though she wrote her thesis on it and trained obama
socialism,removed,full time minimum wage is a year if you want to buy a house in the suburbs cheap area about a commute youll have to save of your paycheck for years to afford a small house
socialism,removed,tbh of the college population doesnt have cancer but does have medical needs so yeah sadly i think hes right college kids are fucking selfish imo
socialism,removed,can someone debunk this with facts
socialism,removed,capitalism is founded on innate human selfishness and inadvertently produces selflessness socialism is founded on innate human selflessness and inadvertently produces selfishness we need both a free market capitalistic country with small privatereligious communities that take care of their own
socialism,removed,lol typical socialist forcing others to change for him
socialism,removed,still waiting
socialism,removed,most feminists support islam
socialism,removed,like i said you cant just buy a house in the city pretty sure there is a house there for within minutes of auckland
socialism,removed,is the author of that article a retard check the map its like minute drive from the city
socialism,removed,and youre buying a house next to the most expensive city and even if you worked minimum wage says you youd only have to put aside a third of that which is nothing in terms of housing not to mention you can usually refinance a newlybought home and negotiate a lower price maybe less stop think like a retard an rub a few braincells together you dumbfuck thread
socialism,removed,rupliftingnews
socialism,removed,did i trigger you
socialism,removed,how is that a conservative proposal
socialism,removed,fucking commies
socialism,removed,source i know plenty of democrats that support cops not being killed
socialism,removed,the obama white house is set to authorize police agencies to once again acquire military equipment this is literally at the top of the op article how is it a conservative idea
socialism,removed,id forgotten how gorgeous she is
socialism,removed,was asking how providing military equipment to local police was a conservative idea
socialism,removed,conservatives lean more towards libertarianism which longs for smaller government fascism or authoritarianism is what youre thinking of and isnt really the direction the current conservative or libertarian movements are headed which is interesting considering the liberal end at least in the united states is leaning towards totalitarianism
socialism,removed,being a socialist means desiring equality for all looking out for the needs of the most vulnerable and giving voice to the voiceless being prolife means counting the unborn child as worthy of having rights – and that to life is the most important of them all
socialism,removed,anyone who is reading this go to my post history what i said came true and the mods deleted my post
socialism,removed,i feel violated scared and unsafe d
socialism,removed,probably on the soros payroll
socialism,removed,because of also probably not going to comment anymore the minute limit is fucking annoying me as hell
socialism,removed,stop being scared
socialism,removed,stop wanting to hurt people who disagree with you
socialism,removed,stop wanting to hurt people who want to hurt people for their race gender ethnicity etc no thanks fascist scum are not innocent wow that indoctrination you just unironically confirmed that leftist actually think that everyone who disagrees with them is a nazi you are not even that selfaware to see the irony in this
socialism,removed,nazism was just a mass case of mental illness
socialism,removed,this is so great ive been waiting for an excuse to knock the fuck out of any worthless leftist that i see or hear so glad you guys are escalating things for us thats gonna make it easy to crush your faces without legal repercussions
socialism,removed,alone or hiding your face with a bunch of other losers
socialism,removed,nazis dont real
socialism,removed,if youre not willing to go to prison for what you believe in do you really believe in it
socialism,removed,youre right theres just no need the modern left is in such disarray its better to leave em to their own cannibalistic devices theyll be punching each other in no time
socialism,removed,protect yourself from prison we both know thats all youre doing
socialism,removed,jesus this sub is such a circlejerky cringefest gotcha ill murder a fash next time i see themf
socialism,removed,odd since ya know nazis were national socialists
socialism,removed,pretty good chance youre a massive pussy trying to be an internet tough guy
socialism,removed,literally every video and picture ive seen of comrades protesting depict massive walking vaginas that stand down pretty quickly when things escalate pretty good chance that youd only be tough if you had a crowd to run in to after sucker punching somebody and even then you probably wouldnt do shit
socialism,removed,socialism never works
socialism,removed,its funny because nazism is socialism realized in probably the only form it would work it makes everyone the same
socialism,removed,communism has killed millions more than the nazis if its socially acceptable to punch nazis why not punch a communist this subreddit is full of hypocritical retards
socialism,removed,if history is any indicator communists are much more dangerous just look at the body count by your own logic you should be attacked
socialism,removed,tbh while im all for giving people more tools to deal with online harassment just banning everyone with hateful views just confirms in the minds of racist that cuck sjws cant handle the truth
socialism,removed,report this channel httpswwwyoutubecomuseraustralianrealist
socialism,removed,i saw an article how the less liked people to become president of the us the bottom two were atheist and socialist this as the less liked so good luck with that
socialism,removed,report this shitty pol propaganda hub
socialism,removed,i was just thinking about this earlier today since the green party is unfortunately very underrepresented in todays media a lot of information is hard to find httplmgtfycomqgreenparty has a good compilation of info though
socialism,removed,i want to love this sub so badly but theres too much of this stuff going on it feels like tumblr
socialism,removed,yeah most feminists these days dont care about freedom of choice thats true
socialism,removed,i said most feminist dont care about freedom of choice or at least a lot of the loudest mainstream ones dont
socialism,removed,absolutely not thats not the point of this sub
socialism,removed,this sub should promote free speech this post is not what socialism is about at all
socialism,removed,imagine how this will be used against socialists and anticapitalists
socialism,removed,although you do realize this gives youtube the opportunity to shut down leftist channels as well right because oh noez teh communisms it is calling for whirled peas it is soez hatefulz and stuff i dunno how this is going to turn out at least the nazis will go away and then theyll be like muh freeze peach xd
socialism,removed,dont use this sub for witch hunts its youtube for christs sake beat them up in the streets but dont waste energy on shutting down dumbass es on youtube
socialism,removed,fuck off
socialism,removed,not as people mind you but as a job which people perform laws in the us are racist they are bigoted they enforce social strata and what cop is going to stay a cop when they refuse to arrest people for drug possession or the ohsoterrible private property transgressions of the desperate proletariat against the bourgeoisie you dont get to stay a cop without acting like a bad person
socialism,removed,til socialism is synonymous with freedom
socialism,removed,eh im a selfemployed writer and i needed nothing but a computer and internet access to get started not exactly scarce commodities in our society
socialism,removed,heh yeah at some point youve got to stop blaming others and society for your problems and just take pragmatic action to make your life the way you want it to be i quit my to to be a writer and ive never been happier
socialism,removed,does posting this make you feel good or is it superiority you are after you are no socialist
socialism,removed,he
socialism,removed,this doesnt have to be all doom and gloom lets take advantage of this if we organize and bombard the ama with questions pointing out his blatant hypocrisy lies racist history and so on we could bring down his support even if by just a tiny bit and spread class consciousness while were at it i propose creating a thread on rsocialism in which we attempt to draft dozens if not hundreds of such questions and try to coherently organize an attack against this candidate and his disgustingly fascist rhetoric what do you people think
socialism,removed,i was under the impression that it was only brigading if the vote count was influenced not if a bunch of comments were posted maybe im mistaken
socialism,removed,youre grateful because you get paid a lot of money to do that otherwise you wouldnt do it
socialism,removed,i used to be a socialist back in high school i believe in a mix of socialism and capitalism now a social democrat if you will many of us sandersforpresident users are social democrats and progressives having been on both sides of the aisle i dont believe this subreddit will attract many sandersforpresident users
socialism,removed,pathetic quote every man has the option to not get up and go to work and stay at home without a job shall we all do that what happens to society if we do
socialism,removed,fuck off you moaning old git i work hard and make myself money wheres the issue im not always excited about it sure but they literally have to bribe me with money to get me to turn up if you dont wanna go dont stay at home and see how your life turns out
socialism,removed,basically i believe in regulated capitalism capitalism but with rules and regulations put into place to make sure they dont run haywire though my view of economics is warped and twisted and doesnt subscribe to anything really i still believe that the means of the production should belong to the proletariat because only the worker can produce the profits of the world and not the capitalist but i also understand how markets work compared to state run markets i understand that you stated state ownership socialism but you cant really have socialism without state ownership because socialism requires that all of the means of production belong to the people but small scale capitalism sometimes works out and the value that incentive plays in producing goods and services the person who changed my viewpoints was my economics professor who is a labor economists and who i think is one of the best teachers i have had to date ideologically speaking i am still very left of the political spectrum and have a lot in common with socialism lets just say as a metaphor that to me socialism is the high school best friend that i still talk to but arent best friends with anymore
socialism,removed,in high school i was communist but more of the popular culture sense i was a immature high schooler with nothing better to do but i did believe that the workers should seize the means of production and that the capitalist had no part in our society because they were parasites on the work and toil of others
socialism,removed,on the contrary the free market freeish market gives the ability for all employers to compete for employees some offering better pay some offering better conditions its the free choice of the potential employees to search for the best job that gives them the combination that suits them most no ones stopping successful vaguely socialistic companies from operating the coop and john lewis partnership are examples in the uk and they do pretty well and other fullyworker owned cooperative also exist workers can apply to them for jobs just as they can apply to purely capitalistic companies or are you implying the world would be a better place if a democratic majority read two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have to dinner banned singleowner companies
socialism,removed,i do have a superiority complex im working on it no need to attack me like that im not accepting capitalism like everyone else i just went to college took a few economics courses and feel that socialism is wrong just because i think a different way doesnt mean i accept status quo like everyone else fuck you are speaking to a bernie supporter if we are the least status quo it can get
socialism,removed,lmao are you telling me what i dont understand just because i dont subscribe to socialism doesnt mean i dont understand it the capitalist gathers the three capitals land labor and resources and extracts profit from them to produce goods and services what socialism identifies is the where the profits are produced the capitalist sees the production cycle as this m c c m while the worker sees the production cycle as this c m m c what marx argued was that where is the profit being created he argued that profit was being created in the process c c during the capitalist production cycle when the worker was producing a commodity into another commodity for example apples into apple pies this is known as added value and it is the only source of real profit i understand and agree with this theory but i also understand that incentive is needed to drive people to go to work if we lived in a socialist paradise where everyone will work for the same profits then there is no incentive to work if lazy bob over there earns as much money as i do then i would have no reason to work and the result is chaos the invisible hand of the market is also the defining basis of capitalism markets determine everything and there is an equilibrium to everything sellers and buyers must agree to a price in order to allow the passage of the good in socialism there is a state run apparatus for this such as defined in the soviet union and china however this process is not efficient and often leads to shortages this is why i subscribe to capitalism and not socialism
socialism,removed,so quit get another job start your own restaurant if you think you can do better
socialism,removed,i also took a few economics courses when i was an undergraduate and in no way could i infer that socialism was wrong whatever that means from those courses and that is completely fine you and i simply reached different conclusions from those courses my professor was a labor economists and thats just about as liberal as you can get you dont think in a different way you represent the status quo well i used to think the exact same way you did people who believe in capitalism everywhere were all the same and they are stupid people for allowing the capitalist to extract profit from them i can see why you think that way yes for the most part but i admit some of you are actually learning a thing or two or about socialism overall im not sure if sanders hurt or helped the cause with his rhetoric conflating socialism and social democracy sanders wasnt a socialist far from it his policies dont have anything to do with socialism none of it had seize the means of production from the capitalist most of it was policies that most social democrats could support and therefore had widespread appeal to liberals
socialism,removed,yep you have the option to claim benefits in the uk what do you think my personal obligation is to someone too lazy to get out of bed is it to feed this person but as a modified libertarian im only willing to make sure no one actually dies in a ditch living rough the minimum required to allow them to live healthily i have no moral obligation to scroungers to share more than half my income with them because theyre too lazy to get up and i wont thats a personal opinion only and you can reply that its selfish if you want but i guarantee its a common view and nothing other than dictatorship would persuade the majority of people to do that
socialism,removed,bollocks tesco offer me food for sale if i dont want to buy it or want to buy it from sainsburys instead no one forces me theres far less exploitation in a truly free market than there is in socialism and communism because its all about choice
socialism,removed,so yes its two wolves and a sheep then that youre proposing and socialist fascism to prevent ownership of property good luck with that i see how well thats worked everywhere that its been tried inevitable corruption by the all animals are equalbut four legs better leaders who magically seem to rise to the top in an equal communist society
socialism,removed,because the opportunity to work for money so that you can one day open your own business and become self employed is the cornerstone of human progress
socialism,removed,that would depend on how he ran the business surely
socialism,removed,it literally wouldnt socialism is an ideology pumped into the soft heads of naive people to essentially get a bigbrother government installed its a pipe dream free market capitalism where men compete has proven to be the best model for true human progress and happiness
socialism,removed,no pretty sure you are missing his
socialism,removed,meme harder
socialism,removed,you failing to see the irony is the best part of this thread
socialism,removed,exactly right shut it down because the socialist argument is rubbish in the absence of reward for work done less work would get done the alternative would be to force people to work resulting in more not less coercion to get out of bed
socialism,removed,your labour is worth only what someone is prepared to pay for it if you think someone else thinks its worth more go work for them if you personally think your time is worth more than any potential employer does then start your own business maybe once you think through all the costs youd have doing that youll come to the realisation of why your employer isnt willing to share all the income from their sales as wages or alternatively if you still think theres an easy profit in that business then buy a share of the company not limited to but including research development regulations training sales marketing advertising admin treasury
socialism,removed,this ideology is imparted on them via the whole ideological state apparatus so i cant hold it against them as individuals its part of socialists job to help them see through their liberal ideology jesus christ this reminds me of how i was in high school youre both preaching to the choir and completely missing the point i made or misunderstanding what i said in the corresponding quote you might want to reread it no i got you his policies min wage college as a right healthcare for all etc are socialist policies but then again social security is a socialist policy but why does a capitalist like fdr pass a socialist policy such as social security his message wasnt to go full socialism rather to implement bits and pieces which could gain mainstream traction and appeal
socialism,removed,you were an idiot in high school and you are an idiot now shit son case closed pack it up boys were going home he called himself a socialist but he is a social democrat what you are describing arent socialist policies which is a misnomer the way youre using it anyway but state run free healthcare and free college for all thats not socialism are you telling me that in socialism everyone has to pay for healthcare and college isnt that capitalism
socialism,removed,but it ought to the main problem is government interference in it for example if one accepts that is a pollutant and we could argue that but accepting it for now then the free market solution modified to tax externalities would be for a carbon tax then the free market would find the most efficient mechanism to burn carbon whether thats more efficient petrol engines or solar panels whatever but instead we have corporate capture of politicians and insane subsidies to less efficient mechanisms see all the money wasted in the states on evergreen solar solyndra beacon power and others or in europe on wind turbines which will never generate the electricity in their working lifespan sufficient to be equivalent to melting the steel and aluminium used to make their pylons
socialism,removed,yeah most jobs pay like shit if youre a teenager or youre switching careers but in general no
socialism,removed,youre a huge loser your boss is a winner when you accept that you can become a winner too
socialism,removed,but why should that change anyting socialism and communism requires massively corrupt power hungry individuals you got that in the democratic party socialist wish come true
socialism,removed,socialism will just never work it just makes people lose ambition
socialism,removed,deprogramming and reprogramming the language you guys use is scary you act like youll free someones mind but you really just want to fill it with socialists propaganda who gets the job of cleaning that mind up after youve screwed with it
socialism,removed,because a competing market breeds the best utilitiestoolsfood etc overtime
socialism,removed,cuba is great mind blown at least although im getting downvoted heavily here and im a big boy i can take it at least i have a voice whereas dissent is heavily suppressed in cuba
socialism,removed,no i had these same sentiments as a teenager and in my i stopped blaming the system and started my own business now my employees sound like this guy if you rather have a secure pay heck than take the risk of being the boss there is nothing to complain about you made your choice
socialism,removed,pleeeeeeassseeeeee keep believing that
socialism,removed,but you havent actually debated me on any of my economic arguments all you have done in this entire thread was throw shit around and not explaining why that is the case your holier than thou attitude is based upon your agism which is cleverly hidden throughout this thread and sprinkled with a touch of you dont know what the heck you are talking about ive asked questions which have been left unanswered on the basis that i am an idiot end of story ultimately leads me to believe that you are just full of shit but yea i did come here to say that rsandersforpresident supporters will never come here in droves and youve all but proved my point we unfortunately subscribe to the idea of private property unfortunately that seems to be the deciding factor between socialism and social democracies shame really we have more in common than we do with conservatives like trump dont spam this subreddit with your nonsense i have never posted on this subreddit i merely saw a link to this sub and then to this title and decided i could respond i was then attacked for being a capitalist fun
socialism,removed,youre very ignorant if you think there are no risks involved in starting a business you would make an excellent union worker look im not the one here complaining and blaming others anymore i in all sincerity hope your relationship with work and money improves people that dont respect their bosses are very similar to angsty teenagers who hate their parents dont like the job quit its a free country
socialism,removed,and no one including a libertarian like me is stopping you from doing that great go for it let us know in a few years how it worked out
socialism,removed,excuses anger anarchy lazy narcisist
socialism,removed,but having a job is hard someone turn down the difficulty setting
socialism,removed,its literally everyones ambition and its why the concept of working came into existence if cavemen didnt work food wouldnt magically appear in front of them we certainly didnt get this far through benevolence and striving for greater good of humanity
socialism,removed,picture an xy graph left right is a political axis one i dont personally care a lot about one way or another theres also an orthogonal axis of authoritarianism libertarian which i do care about a lot personally im libertarian and i see the extremes of both left and right axis curling back to meet together in authoritarianism every implementation of extreme socialism or communism that has ever been tried has become corrupt or authoritarian example you know that i wouldnt really need to dig for long to find thousands of other examples from cuba china and north korea
socialism,removed,so you also have issues with money management dont believe in yourself enough to borrow and invest sounds like excuseitus i really hope you are under for your own sake you have a losing defeatist attitude total victim mentality projecting on me like i give a fuck if you starve or not get your shit together
socialism,removed,i came here from rall just because of how ignorant the posted wrote was jesus or ancestors got up before sunrise and labored all day days a week to try to eek out a survival you guys act like prosperity is the natural human condition that capitalism takes away from you poverty and violence is the historical natural state of man and private property rights and manufacturing are the only thing standing between the relative abundance we have now and returning to a state of widespread poverty
socialism,removed,so nobody is allowed to succeed or seek their own happiness i truly am baffled by your position
socialism,removed,those who opposed the ussr called the supporters tankies stalinists opposed the ussrs interjection into hungary as well
socialism,removed,whats the motivation to do all the work of being an owner if you only get as much out of it as the dishwasher
socialism,removed,what did socialists use to see at night before gas lamps electricity
socialism,removed,or you can work for yourself or you can join with others to start a cooperative or you can start your own company employing others no one is forcing you to starve as an alternative to working for others
socialism,removed,in a capitalistic society cant you start your own business so youre making money for yourself not someone else and in a socialistic society wouldnt you still have to work if anything wouldnt you have less of a choice what you want to do this picture doesnt make any sense to me unless its against socialism
socialism,removed,cool now edit your comment and fix the grammatical error to keep up appearances mr brainiac
socialism,removed,after all this you still havent said anything other than attack me you are completely missing my point wrapped up in your self righteous fury of glory to the socialist revolution just because people think differently doesnt mean they are stupid or wrong i came in here not to tell you i knew everything about socialism just why sanders supporters arent likely to come to this subreddit in droves about the high school socialism i just wanted to poke fun and have a small little chat or discussion nothing harmful and instead you just called me an idiot i had a good time discussing and having conversations with other people in this subreddit you however are the exception your raging hardon for socialism leads you to automatically assault me for my adoption of capitalism well news flash buddy we live in a world that is dominated by capitalism no one learns about socialism there isnt anything to learn about socialism other than to satisfy your own hardon for your desire to be different maybe thats why you keep clinging to this idea of that i am the status quo you need to take a good long look at your self before you can give advice to people buddy
socialism,removed,exactly you are working a job so you can better the state of living for your own you are working harder so you can achieve a goal on your end as opposed to working for a common good for other people who are hard to pretend to care about more than your own loved ones
socialism,removed,as long as we are all working but humans are lazy creatures of habit that unfortunately need to be put under pressure to be productive so we can try it your way if we return to being hunter gatherers the way things are now people need to be placed under artificial pressure to fall in line isims always assume people are honest caring and productive isims are as good as the people they are applied to look at us two asses fucking around having this useless convention we could be at a food bank or planting a tree we are all lazy fucks like the sloths and apes we evolved from do you even think this many humans should be interacting in society have you done a lot of travelling work attitudes are quite different around the world i live in a socialist country and its corrupt as hell you can not change human nature and everyone wants the most yield for the least effort we are never satisfied by design it is what drives us
socialism,removed,yeahits called working asshats
socialism,removed,did you read what i said it depends on the conditions besides who paid for the factory to be built who bought the raw materials it certainly wasnt jim
socialism,removed,capitalism doesnt work posted from my iphone
socialism,removed,i just looked over your comment history im sorry that you are such a hateful person i hope you get over it you have a far worse superiority complex than i do im sorry
socialism,removed,where has a better economic system given so much to the world and so much to its people who use it than what we have now people are rising out of poverty and have magnitudes more than they had just ago socialism creates dependence on the state and when the state see citizens as a burden it gets rid of them this whole sub is crazy socialism leads to ruin and destruction of the human spirit
socialism,removed,if capitalism is a mathematical equation and people were as simple as ones and zeros than yes you are correct but its a system and there is fluidity read up on dale carnigey he did capitalism correctly he did a lot of good through capitalism there is philanthropy and charity any ism can be reduced to options like you did there i think i am right in assuming you dont have a background in economics or poli sci because the world isnt as simple as you would like it to be people dont study this shit for lifetimes if its as simple as sentences you need to educate yourself and gain some more life experience you sound very very childish
socialism,removed,life is merit based you earn your keep in time you can start your own company and take care of your employees you have incredible opportunities that other people in the world do not no one deserves anything earn it if youre and believe in socialism fine youve had your time with the system and believe now that it is unfair but if you are younger than that stop complaining and earn your keep you dont know much and youre not good at much
socialism,removed,that is not specific
socialism,removed,this is fucking stupid
socialism,removed,actually that is not true there are plenty of people below the povertyline that are ecstatically happy at no working a day in their lives and suckling off the government teet
socialism,removed,limited amount of jobs theres not a limited number of jobs the amount of work that could be done to satisfy everyone is infinite what happens when a company gets the monopoly of the market that only ever happens because of government intervention to encourage it in the first place preventing new entrants otherwise if there is one a new company will spot a better or cheaper way of doing the same thing or in a limited number of cases for utility companies gas water pipes and electricity cables where theres a natural monopoly making it ridiculous to have more than one supply to the doorstep that one is fixable by the government regulating those specific businesses which is how its done in the uk already
socialism,removed,capitalism is responsible for that computer or phone you are typing these ideas on you must see the irony in that look at all the progress and inventions that came out of the usa i dunno this is not really worth discussing further you matter as well yell at the clouds yapping on the internet isnt making any difference what so ever and you are paying money and waisting time to do it
socialism,removed,enjoy doing just what the quote describes the quote is kind of misleading and assumptive so people are correct in their position of this isnt really right i should let them know
socialism,removed,why are you assuming theyre all ignorant
socialism,removed,many socialists dont believe in a state at all i dont think you understand socialism socialism cant function on a national level without a state or a government how do you propose citizens organize themselves eventually with a large enough group of people someone has to make rulelaws and eventually those people will need to enforce them or anarchy prevails and socialism cant function unless everyone is working to a common goal catalonia was a powerhouse of economics similar to the united states right every time i ask that question there is always some small obscure place where it almost worked everywhere socialism tries it fails because the building block of socialism is people and people at a fundamental level want to keep what they earn income inequality argument is a farce and a distraction to get people upset to vote a certain way we have abundance in society today we have technological advances good and services we never could have dreamed up ago eveyrone is better off today than their ancestors ago even the poorest in the us no socialist society has ever accomplished that the poorest people today have it far better than those same poor people did in history equality will never exist in society and so far governments have been the biggest and most toxic offenders in the name of equality government being the people however organized to set rule of law no economic system is perfect and capitalism has it flaws but socialism has been tried and has failed so often and so miserably i just cant fathom why people still flock to it as an idea socialism ignores what drives people on a fundamental level
socialism,removed,so what youre saying is if i start my own business and hire people to work for me this is a bad thing that under a socialistmarxist rule i would not be able to own my own business the whole concept of capitalism is that anyone who wants to can rise up out of poverty or being a worker bee you just need the motivation and the capital to get started many people are successful who have come from nothing they did not ask for a redistribution of wealth socialism thanks but no thanks
socialism,removed,the article says the guys only crime was to refuse to put a note on his desk supporting castro the measure of who controls a society is who you are not allowed to criticise if you want to live in that kind of society go for it
socialism,removed,look man you nailed it with religion we have many economic systems and many religions and these are all isms there are saints and assholes found everywhere any ism can work in a world with out humans the answer is not some new system i currently live in a socialist country and its far more capitalistic than the west everyone here is hustling and making deals corruption is everywhere these labels dont mean shit people are always going to steal from each other and exploit one another blaming a system is simplistic and undermines humans as complex emotional beings i am making an assumption but i think i have lived in more countries than you and have more experience in global economics its all smokescreen the world is a big mafia people just kill and take what they want when push comes to shove stop buying all this bullshit and make life work for you fuck everyone else sooner you figure that out the better no one in the subreddit gives a fuck about you you guys are just bitching together misery lives company
socialism,removed,name one successful socialist country you cant
socialism,removed,its true if youve ever been to a socialist country they dont get up early commute work hard or strive towards anything you pretty much just get paid to watch netflix all day and eat the governmentissued snacks of your choice
socialism,removed,so go on welfare you guys are just losers
socialism,removed,all of these people just want other peoples money thats their solution thats socialism
socialism,removed,you dont have to go to work to survive refer to british jobseekers so it does hold true i choose to work because my life is better because of that its always a choice i prefer to give up a week to earn more money this is all minor and not really flash but ive got a nice van we travel the country a lot and buy whatever food we feel like im really happy with our life it was my choices to make and i think i have steadily and consistently done the harder but more rewarding choices i wouldnt call that power like the one ring or something but the power to make my own choices yeah good or bad and receive the consequences from that
socialism,removed,that was not what i asked answer my previous questions and we can continue otherwise this isnt worth my time
socialism,removed,wtf now i hate capitalism
socialism,removed,it doesnt account for the fact that its incompatible with human nature and no it has never succeeded and will never succeed
socialism,removed,its all about love brother we are all powerful and can make change in our own circles when people take money from someone there should be some respect op was really juvenile in his description of his boss
socialism,removed,it would but its not realistic
socialism,removed,i couldnt care less about the government as institution being a services or product supplier as long as its not the monopoly nor as a purchaser eg of defence as long as it buys via competitive tender and i do understand that in those massive purchases the government acts and is part of the market influencing prices by increased demand my comments were about government as regulator of other suppliers preventing open choice
socialism,removed,if you own a business its your job to take care of your employees in a way that ensures their job is not lost due to poor managment because you either pay too little or pay too much and the business folds owning a company is not inherently exploitive owning a company and being successful brings happiness to the owner and the employees who chopse to work their to claim it is exploitive and inherently wrong to own capitol is an assult on the people of said companies hapiness also no need to be triggered and please leave insults out of our conversation
socialism,removed,without such people you would die on the streets especially in your communist utopia
socialism,removed,it wouldnt
socialism,removed,i see the extortion reference like if the evil state needed to bully people they could threaten to starve the defenceless occupants unless they they did their bidding sorry to go the long way about this its just needed to explain my feelings and remember im british so british state if i dont work i wont earn money from that work but the state will pay me funds so i dont die or suffer much a safety net intended to give you relief until you get back on your feet some people abuse this its funny how the state extorts you through work but at the same time ensures you are fed clothed sheltered and watered its like they want everybody to have basic human rights covered even if they make bad choices that are obvious to others i suppose only so they can use you like a battery for their evil doings muwahaha im free and feel the state is a good thing and also my choice i work as a plumber i used to work as a joiner ive also worked as an estate agent at some point at each i fancied a change and used the education provided to me in part by the state to leverage a position at the next in each i worked hard and progressed earning me more freedom either through more moneyless hours or favour with the bosses i didnt have to i could have turned up done the basic requirement and gone home i currently work for myself ive set up a construction firm its going well the only input from the state is when it takes my tax money and ensures im logging everything correctly this avoids fraud and pays for when i recently went to the hospital and had surgery it was free or prepaid would be more accurate the state is not perfect but it provides a lot of good things for me and family it offers protection i can leave the country at any time to any place and be free of the state i just have to settle up taxes etc but its possible i can work as anything i want or there are ways i can not work at all i dont like this method you dont have much money and all i see is suffering rather than thriving plus ma morals but its possible if the state let people starve the state would be removed and a government that cared for the peoples needs would be installed i would rather be a pawn in the master workings of this elaborate living lie or society to everyone else than anywhere near syria for example or places without true democracy and justice
socialism,removed,socialism is bullshit but nice image
socialism,removed,but you assumed everyone commenting was there are more than a few legitimate criticisms
socialism,removed,capitalism certainly isnt sustainable either it doesnt have to be one or the other either because we see that doesnt work the answer is probably a mix of capitalism and socialism
socialism,removed,so youd rather you work less and have the uneducated labor continue to toil long hours for you capitalist
socialism,removed,being jobless and living off of government money apparently is a better life than earning a living
socialism,removed,sure
socialism,removed,i absolutely and wholeheartedly agree with you a republican congress under clinton changed and people were working but the dems under obama gutted the system and now you have what we have today a httpsenmwikipediaorgwikicloward–pivenstrategy
socialism,removed,see reply to earlier similar comment its entirely possible for nominally socialist society to be fascist qv national socialism nazism
socialism,removed,bite me comrade id still rather deal with this made up situation in the picture than with bread lines and gulags
socialism,removed,yeah we are just back to having overlords and royalty bitcoin will be the next revolution for wealth distribution no more usury and fiat currencies
socialism,removed,yes youre absolutely right the market looks for the highest profit not the most efficient form of energy and you also rightly go on to point out that there are societal costs externalities the way to beat that is to apply a tax on the externalities and only on the externalities so a carbon tax for example for energy or a pollution tax for heavy industries thats it job done nothing else certainly not specific picking winners subsidies for specific industries because then the market will find the most efficient way to produce energy at the lowest cost to society and because the many eyes of greedy capitalists are looking at the problem theyll find better solutions than a few nonsubjectmatterexpert bureaucrats sitting in central offices
socialism,removed,so just get up earlier and take your time is that the answer you are looking for or no its the job thats wrong of course
socialism,removed,i am a trump supporter
socialism,removed,in other words the classic real socialism has never been tried argument
socialism,removed,just like youre using this subreddit to take down communism right
socialism,removed,not trying to be rude but wouldnt having your own business and being able to set your own hours and sell what you want also be capitalism you get to have a choice you can either be a worker or a seller and if your good at either you will be successful
socialism,removed,highjacking the current top comment to make a point about the replies to my contributions to this thread ive had some interaction today and every single comment has been heavily downvoted by people using the button as a i disagree with you button not as a this doesnt contribute to the discussion button this sub is an echochamber if that continues you guys are going to get nowhere people with other opinions just wont stay youll convert no one to your cause youll just talk among yourselves and the sub wont grow i get why the posting guidelines are here and why rampant fascists arent welcome but if any disagreement from socialist principles is always downvoted the sub will stay a similar size to my home of rbdsmcommunity a tiny niche if you dont think this comment contributes anything do please downvote it and if you just dont like being told this feel free to downvote it for that reason too but youll just prove my point
socialism,removed,if you have a system that cant find the failure within itself and it must blame outlying systems maybe that system isnt the best system
socialism,removed,i get to work at around am browse the internet half the day get paid enough to drive a car and have a lake house my life is awesome it sounds like most of you guys just hate being losers
socialism,removed,because socialists are thieves and rapidly descend into anarchy once they rip themselves apart
socialism,removed,you could be a libertarian with that attitude thats an argument for smaller government not for larger government more laws that tax externalities good more laws that control how companies that then find the efficient solutions to problems bad
socialism,removed,how long did communist catalonia last three years at the most id hardly call any government that could stay in power for only years successful
socialism,removed,greed is a part of human nature hording materials makes a person feel safer everyone would feel safer if they had apples right now rather than being promised an apple a day
socialism,removed,neither is your brand of internationalist socialism
socialism,removed,wow an old jew thinks that it must be correct
socialism,removed,work or die is an exaggeration people will make more money than just the necessity this comes about in ways in a free market people will refuse to work for those paying less than the acceptable wage in most capitalist places today there is a state mandated minimum wage people arent slaves working in factories like in the any smart person can work a job and use saved resources to get a better job by paying for transportation to better locations buying better clothing paying for educationcertification etc
socialism,removed,socialists are lazy ban me if you dont believe in free speech as well look at venezuela
socialism,removed,this sub is whatever the opposite of an echo chamber is ive been eyeing this place for a while and i can tell you thats not the case while people may not agree on specific ideology everyone here is anti capitalist and shoots anyone who believes it down with moronic rhetoric
socialism,removed,your resort to insults instead of reasoned arguments tells me a lot about you why dont you try having another go but this time making an referenced argument against horseshoe theory
socialism,removed,easy solution drive directly into an oncoming truck
socialism,removed,so you aim to punish those who took a risk and ended up being successful
socialism,removed,there are businesses with internal democracy now clearly you didnt read what i said as my main point was that it depends on how the business is run
socialism,removed,im not a socialism hardcore capitalist this post motivated me to go harder on the hunt for a new job so thanks
socialism,removed,inah fyi bbyou cannotpoujr find grtvf detailed obbcy on vgthe sidebar here i also recommendl drwolffs videos as they annpocre r vrvf very great intro du covfction to socialist cvtoncepts f r notbe fc for b yvarra kids civil of trmml
socialism,removed,yes you should be thankful this is how you get hardworking people and hardworking people are happier in getting a job you sign into a consensual agreement where if you provide for me work then i provide for you paycheck if you dont like it you can quit no one is forcing anything whereas in socialist societies you get the government stealing from the rich whove done nothing wrong to provide poor people who believe i breathe therefore i deserve especially in america if youre poor its mostly because you either suck with money or make poor decisions
socialism,removed,and shoots anyone who believes it down with moronic rhetoric thats the point you should be taking socialism will never work if you dont convince capitalists of its benefits
socialism,removed,this is what people dont get man you have to start somewhere and you should be thankful that the evil capitalist man had created your job for you in the first place so you can providework for yourself or later on if you wish
socialism,removed,for a pretty damn good reason socialism doesnt work
socialism,removed,i really like your fourth paragraph because people often forget that capitalism creates basically every luxury we own and like you said take for granted and in creating these products these people provide others with jobs what you said about venture capitalists is also spot on their wealth doesnt go down the toilet when they invest its paid to people who in return use their skills to provide whatever it is they provide
socialism,removed,they actually orchestrated the murder of many socialiststo purge their ranks sooooexactly like stalin mao and fidel then
socialism,removed,wow ive never seen rteenagers on rall before
socialism,removed,this is what i dont understand about socialism and would love if you could explain further whats wrong with the your boss making more than you what makes you assume that they havent worked incredibly hard especially start up entrepreneurs those people with incredibly hard that they deserve to be taking it easy now and then they are the ones taking all the risk while you in the vast majority of cases get the security of an hourly wage and if the entrepreneur is successful then guess what they have successfully done things that i dont think should be looked down upon provided society with a product or service they didnt have before or was made cheaper provided individuals with jobs and provided themselves and the ones they love with a comfortable life these people shouldnt be seen as evil but should be looked up to what you propose is a much more selfish way of doing things in my opinion
socialism,removed,both you provide for me i provide for you completely consensual dont like it quit im sure theres plenty of other people who would be thankful for your job
socialism,removed,throughout history sure but what about right now at least in america im not saying pure capitalist society just more capitalist than socialist i dont care how much more my boss is making than me as long im making enough for me and my loved ones to live comfortably with a few luxurys here and there
socialism,removed,its not stealing if you consent to your working agreement beforehand why is it that all people who make more money than you are stealing rather than being smarter and more hardworking
socialism,removed,thats rule on rsocialism
socialism,removed,fuck that i wouldnt want any of my coworkers having a say in how things are run at least the ceo knows what hes doing is that really the argument for socialism
socialism,removed,yes id much rather work for longer hours and receive less under socialism lol
socialism,removed,i dont know man honestly i just believe its much more ethical than the alternative how could a system entirely based on consent be evil whereas everyone here thinks that if someone is richer than them than either they deserve a cut for god knows what reason or that person must have screwed over a fuck ton of people to get where heshe is they assume this before thinking that the richer person may have worked harder than them be smarter than them or have had a little more luck than him thats tough but its also reality and just because someone makes more than you doesnt mean theyre automatically evil
socialism,removed,sure he knows what hes doing if by chance he runs it into the ground ill get another job and if i ever want control i can start my own company
socialism,removed,you didnt consent omg youve been a slave your entire working life oh wait you are getting paid wow whoever told you life was going to be easy didnt do you any favors heres my advice save money for a few years during those years think of a product or service that you can either invent or make for cheaper than other companies acquire the skills required to make your product or service a reality surround yourself with people you think would be useful in your venture and build a business its harder than you think not everyone makes it only the best do people arent equal our rights are so long as you dont infringe on these rights make your dreams come true or face the reality that you couldnt make it
socialism,removed,the irony of this post is hilarious
socialism,removed,what choices would you want to pick that are not on offer what things are you not getting that you want could you put that in context theres nothing i feel i want to do but cant because of the establishment i hate the establishment im with you on that point they are deceitful and sometimes corrupt but theres a lot of good people in there too who are trying and the establishment is very necessary to keep infrastructure working its such a massive complicated machine it would be chaos without it but all the different sectors decisions and outcomes are decided by individuals or groups of individuals who are either good or badand all the greys in between and should not represent the whole of human progresssociety as a whole
socialism,removed,so youre just a shitty employee got it
socialism,removed,maybe you should start a youtube channel yourself if there is a gap in the market then surely it needs filling and yes i understand the irony of using capitalist reasons here but its true what sort of format would you encourage
socialism,removed,what about bbw pics
socialism,removed,it looks like the only thing that keeps you from agreeing with me is that you believe that they are stealing from you so let me try and tackle that and you tell me what you think first off it does not matter how much money they make from what you give them this is like saying if i traded my friend a really cool comic book for dollars then that friend sells it for dollars than he is stealing it wouldnt be ethical to demand he give me dollars that would be stealing so that we both came out even this is because the transaction we agreed to was consented to by both of us it is not stealing if you consent to it the same way you consent to your working contract heres another reason entrepreneurs arent thieves they are providing society with a product or service that others either couldnt provide or they are providing an existing product or service for cheaper than someone else now about entrepreneurs being one your side my ass they would like you said they cant make a profit because otherwise theyd be stealing why the fuck would they provide something for you if he himself wasnt provided for in return now you say its not selfish to get whats rightfully yours i explained above why it isnt but ill try and go further what right in the us constitution says that you should be paid more all the rights in there are in my opinion very good and are should be the bedrock of civilized societies but nowhere does it promise you that you will get more money that what you agreed to in your job lastly you talk about inheritance again i see no ethical reasons to take a guys inheritance away one of the main reasons that drives us to work is to provide for the people we love he was lucky sure but by right that money company is his and his property is protected under the constitution unlike what you consider a fair wage if i havent convinced please show me where you disagree i also ask what you propose a more specific solution would be if you still consider capitalism a problem
socialism,removed,im not talking about becomes for a millionaire im talking working for yourself lots of people do that i do that freelance self owned business or restaurants are very common i feel there should be more laws and breaks for small businesses but i dont get the sense that what this sub or this post has in mind
socialism,removed,but it growing economies the rich getting richer is good for lots of people and i dont see an ethical reason for taking their money away and in the case of rich shareholders and the ceo they only make so much money because the employ a lot of people say at the end of the year the shareholders and ceo make million dollars profit that goes directly into their pockets but they also employ million people if we gave that million to every single person they employed woopdeefuckingdoo everyone employee just made dollars for the year maybe all the rich people did inherit all their money but for you to demand some of it is evil and immoral they shouldnt be punished just because their parents made more money than your parents
socialism,removed,im sorry that you have that when i was younger i had a lisp but got speech therapy so i dont have it anymore i understand how horrible it can be maybe though you should look to expand the team you could be a writer or animator have you watched any of the school of lifes videos the reason he is so good is because his voice is great the videos are well editedanimated they arent too long and he never gets lost in jargon something which could easily happen when discussing complex political philosophy what sort of format would you envisage
socialism,removed,everything he said is intelligent
socialism,removed,anyone else appreciate the irony of a socialist calling someone else stupid
socialism,removed,why dont you stick a cork in your ass become the boss make your own damn money and work hard you act like bosses just get chosen at birth like fucken chosen ones no most work hard and long to get where there at and thats why they make money
socialism,removed,sure it has an effect but i dont see the effect as evil the way people here seem to its just who made into the life not all people make it into i see it as reality what i dont understand how see making big companies richer is some awful sin why do you care so much about what others make ever wonder how hard they worked to get there or do you immediately think if someone has money than they must have screwed someone else over
socialism,removed,im self employeed
socialism,removed,many jobs dont take intelligence so they cant be a sign of intelligence your beliefs reflect your intelligence though with socialism not reflecting highly
socialism,removed,i would strongly argue that a very strong personality can detract from the actual message i think the format of school of life is very good short engaging videos that anyone can understand
socialism,removed,because it would be unethical to deny someone their right to freely trade among their society very often what the trade has a substantial benefit to society as well ie smartphones why deny him the right to hire employees in order to help his business prosper there exists business where there are plenty of owners that contribute to decisions and i also wonder why everyone in rsocialism doesnt just make their own business where they can all be paid equally they have every right to do so and what i mean about a few socialist policies i mean things like taxes where the production of public services can be enjoyed by everyone im also a fan of social security especially when its handed out to people whove worked hard and had children who contribute to the free market
socialism,removed,so sharing my the money i work hard to make with someone who is a lazy piece of shit is okay with you
socialism,removed,so you really need multiple channels competing with each other to keep up standards end of the day you wont convince everyone about your viewpoint lots of education about different kinds of socialism is arguably the best idea
socialism,removed,yes trump will win and hopefully you end up in an oven where you belong
socialism,removed,this is an important point antifa dresses intimidatingly and does seem rather quick to violence and lax on area denial
socialism,removed,if the hegelian dialectic that everything contains its opposite is true does that mean antifa contains fascism
socialism,removed,well thats what the socialism is norway is not socialism however is is one if the best countries in the world
socialism,removed,wow you must be really smart
socialism,removed,justice is meant to be blind you dont jail people you disagree with and let those you agree with off scott free
socialism,removed,while you could argue venezuela is not socialist it is a lot closer to socialism than it is free market capitalism even if venezuela was completely capitalist its a moot point you can cherry pick failures of capitalism but for every failure there are many successes hong kong usa australia uk japan and the list goes on where has socialism succeeded it hasnt when has it failed every time it has been attempted
socialism,removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch ill have you know i have published over published papers in the quarterly journal of austrian economics i am trained in economic calculation and im the top austrian price theorist in the entire mises institute your arguments present nothing to me other than the usual new keynesian claims regarding idle resources and the profitandloss mechanism i will refute your assertions with precision the likes of which academia has never been seen before on this earth mark my words you think you can get away with arguing in a peerreviewed journal that says law is invalid and the accelerator and multiplier of the consumption function determine levels of employment on the contrary my friend you are committing a very deep economic fallacy as we speak i am contacting peter klein mario rizzo and robert murphy and your citation is being copied into my abstract so you would do well to prepare for a comment the comment that wipes out most of the claims asserted in your paper as though they are a priori principles despite your other statements to the effect that they must be confirmed inductively somehow you are going to be hardpressed to respond in the next volume i can publish in any journal in any volume and i can respond via a great variety of methodological approaches and thats just with my own arguments not only am i extensively trained in the deconstruction of fallacious arguments but i have access to the entire set of academic databases with economic sciences included as subjects and i will use them to their full extents to respond to your unfounded presuppositions if only you could have known what response your otherwise noncontroversial paper was about to bring down upon you perhaps you would have reconsidered publishing it but you couldnt you didnt and now you are facing the consequences of intellectual laziness i will bombard you with corrections and expositions and you will be overwhelmed by them you may have to reconsider the theoretical underpinnings of your methodology professor
socialism,removed,i believe in the freedom of nazis to organize and have parties is just pragmatism if you leave the government to decide who is a fascist they can decide that communist group are fascist and close them down
socialism,removed,i would not say you are equal to them but i would never support violence not even against fascists if they are manifesting themself peacefully you can call me a liberal all you want i dont care freedom of speech should be defended no matter what
socialism,removed,thats true but that another discution
socialism,removed,i not supporting nazis i suppot freedom of speech
socialism,removed,fucking is an act of love not violence what kind of sex are you having
socialism,removed,it sounds equally awfull
socialism,removed,freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes gandhi
socialism,removed,you know no better than attacking people for his taste in fiction or what people they like or calling them names you can mock the posturing of logic and reason all you want but in this case it applies no matter how shitty you find his argument is pathetic to defended attacking people
socialism,removed,dont post dm dude dont be a dick
socialism,removed,i identify myself as a socialist and a pacifist
socialism,removed,i dont care what you think about me or my political ideology thats beside the point i was just stating that im not a liberal
socialism,removed,committing conspiracy to commit murder arent a lot of communist group doing the same thing
socialism,removed,yeah that was fuck up at least we can agree with that
socialism,removed,thats a different thing im talking about the goverment shuting down organization on that basis
socialism,removed,im not defending fascist im defending freedom of speech
socialism,removed,you are simplifying it way to much and come off as far to emotional about this does everyone that says they are a republican supports abortion i dont think so i might say i agree with certain policy that the nazis had like animal welfare restrictions on tobacco and so on but i dont agree with the whole killing jews for cleansing its like how fascist is a buzz word to be used whenever someone disagrees with the left its just immature and incorrect
socialism,removed,i am not a liberal but many antifapeople are acting exactly like their neonazi counterparts they go to protests just to beat up nazis and police and just believe in what they are told without questioning their ideology just once they are drive by pure hatred and aggression the only difference to the nazis is that they happen to grow up in a leftist environment if they were born in another place andor time they would murder innocents as well
socialism,removed,we can fight but we should have thought about what we are fighting for and we should be aware whom we are fighting i think it is fine to throw foul eggs at nazis and it was wrong that the guy in the article got to prison
socialism,removed,maybe you know but you cannot infer that other do some are just fighting for what they have learned violence against the police that is protecting the right of free thought and free speach is in my oppinion just wrong even if the thought and the speach is stupid you could fight by trying to educate those nazis properly and give them hope for a better tomorrow
socialism,removed,those guys are probably lost but there are young people who can still be educated before becoming irreparable nazis anyways they are not even a thread just a mob without real power and i wouldnt want to try and debate anything with some of the violent antifapeople either they sometimes take criticism of any sort not well but thanks for calling an ambulance i would call an ambulance for you too if you were to speak your mind to the wrong person as well
socialism,removed,if you are beating up people without a real purpose then you are just a hooligan a hooligan of politics you can decide if you like that
socialism,removed,maybe you shouldnt go stabbing people and you wont get stabbed in retaliation antifa are cowards
socialism,removed,lol what a coward pinko faggot leftist you pussies cant even take us out when its vs so good luck with that maybe one day youll wake up and realize just how ironic the position you hold really is
socialism,removed,well you are definately right in that i live in a privileged position where fascism doesnt pose an immediate thread to me and my surroundings still i would argue that fascism is just a symptom of a nonfunctional capitalist society of course it is terrible and an abomination in itself still i dont think we can defeat it by blunt violence and aggression it just distracts us from more pressing problems one of these is a vile inequality in our educational systems that just produces more nazis and other violence out of frustration and hopelessness the same thing that i would argue fuels some antifaactivists its a very basic instinct to react with aggression to a situation with virtually no way out policemen are not generally responsible for the shortcomings of this system as are other people who just go to work to feed their families they just have other problems of course there are fascist policemen like in every job from my experience these are a minority
socialism,removed,dude free shit lmao also antifags counting votes but its what are you a communist
socialism,removed,i tried reasoning with facists and with radical leftists its pointless they dont want to reason they want their view and nothing else there is no compromise there is no criticism to established thought they have a set of divine thinkers that did their work for them and they do not have to think about their view anymore they can just cite one of those divine texts and you can just stop reasoning i guess we wont find to each other today i will read your reference when ive got some time maybe i will change my mind until then i am happy that there is a police that enforces laws and hat enables us to have a conversation without the fear of somebody doing harm to us for our opinions in my view when somebody decides what somebody else is allowed to think and say there is a good chance that society will end up with fascism
socialism,removed,because it largely did kill black ambitions the left destroyed the nuclear family for blacks which caused lack of dicispline ie fatherless homes which leads to abandonment of opportunity which leads to further poverty and reliance on the state keep repeating this cycle and you get what we have now were a majority of black youth live in fatherless homes the liberal plantation we on the right call it there is a definite need to liberate them from the socialistic practices and get them independent so they can be the strong individuals their ancestors were along side my irish ancestors who suffered alongside them
socialism,removed,how does this make sense why do people support this system its the most enriching large scale socioeconomic system top to bottom marxism simply hasnt been able to provide an equivalent standard of living if there was a way to just get the money away from them and back into the country we would all suffer less most people dont hoard money it erodes to inflation most of that money is in banks being lent out to people and businesses perhaps you work at a small business that money may pay your paycheck having been deposited by a wealthy person and then loaned out to an businessman looking to expand which requires hiring employees and buying capital for them to use
socialism,removed,this is why stalin invented the gulags
socialism,removed,saving is theft and doctors are immoral for getting paid more than a grocery store clerk got it
socialism,removed,the economy is crashing because theres no money to be made by investing so the rich are just sitting on it the economy is not crashing and if it was that would not be the reason i agree with you saying the only reward in a capitalistic society is money andor that there is massive inequality but that sentence has a lot of problems venture capitalism for example is rich people investing i think one way you could cite instead is that their wealth gets caught in a loop that does not reach all of the various socioeconomic ladders of america like if trump buys a burger its probably not gonna be in harlem his wealth will stay trapped in the top government can help those at the bottom in a whole lot of ways but generally its bc of a system in which they redistribute that wealth manuallyselectively which imo is necessary because trump isnt even gonna take a shit in the upper west side i realize this sub basically wants to just hate on capitalism in a rah rah way so im probably in the wrong sub but this kind of oversimplification kind of defeats the point of a nuanced critique of capitialism nobody would listen
socialism,removed,with a knife ignoring orders to halt
socialism,removed,nothing to see here just mowing a little grass
socialism,removed,so they shot her while she was already dead
socialism,removed,dont think spain has a history of suicide bombers
socialism,removed,if its useless shit people providing that useless shit are actively exploiting the rich is that not what you want
socialism,removed,from the tone and dissonance of your various statements cant tell whether sarcasm or complete incompetence also dont confuse capitalism with crony capitalism
socialism,removed,saving money is literrally cancer s really
socialism,removed,you mean there are people who have more concern for a something they see as higher than themselves than their own selfinterest fascinating
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,how much work and effort does it take to become a doctor vs a grocery store clerk what sort of expectations are there of grocery store clerks are lives on the line why would you go through all the effort trouble stress and take on the responsibility of being a doctor when you could be a grocery store clerk for the same pay and have none of it
socialism,removed,so why will they invest all the effort as i understand it you still make a wage in socialism
socialism,removed,arent of billionaires selfmade generational wealth is practically all gone by the third generation iirc as the environments that breed successful behaviors are no longer present when you already have everything
socialism,removed,theocratic alternatives in the region seem preferable fuck you you regressive antihumanist braindead piece of shit siempre antifascista death to islam
socialism,removed,there are many things that inspire people to do what they do however being a doctor requires enormous upfront expenditure and should be a prestigious thing with high value placed on it otherwise anyone could do it medicine men where very important in precivilization as well do you think a doctor would keep being a doctor for free humans are selfish creatures just like all life
socialism,removed,for upmarxing a comrade
socialism,removed,well its not a well known rule i recommend adding it to the sidebar
socialism,removed,this is the rank stupidity of socialism people save as so as they can spend it later people get old they have kids they have unforeseen circumstances they get ill they might lose their job they dont have more money than they can spend they are spending what they need in order that they dont have to work so hard latter and can afford things instead of whining about how bad you have it why dont you learn from them and stop being an irresponsible economically illiterate cretin
socialism,removed,am i the only one wondering why they were shooting a dead palestinian girl
socialism,removed,can we still ask why socdems killed rosa luxembourg
socialism,removed,how does this make sense why do people support this system gee its as if people want to keep the money they earn so they can spend it later on
socialism,removed,wanna vomit even more the state steals a percentage of your income to pay for things you may never end up using and if you dont comply it takes your property and locks you in a cage
socialism,removed,what does this have to do with capitalism or socialism wage theft isnt somehow okay because of capitalism and it isnt impossible under socialism its just wrong
socialism,removed,go for it if you make it it is yours but you dont get to seize anyone elses capital to finance your escapades no one is obligated to providing you a lathe drill press or factory to make your crap
socialism,removed,this doesnt seem to be based on any kind of economic philosophy are you just point out thing you think are unfair
socialism,removed,in a capitalistic society anyone with proper motivation and sound decision making can move up from their current class
socialism,removed,it completely ignores the fact that theres no way for you to earn money when the rich are holding onto the majority of it just dribbling out barely enough for the rest of us this statement is false the way to earn money is to work towards a career with a good income and properly managing your financials
socialism,removed,no it doesnt tax benefits for charitable donations are usually a percentage meaning the benefit is always smaller than the donation
socialism,removed,there is no real reason a doctor should be paid more than a grocery store clerk the grocery clerk doesnt need to train for a decade before he can practice and if he packs my bag wrong i cant sue him for malpractice and he isnt on call or works long shifts with irregular work hours
socialism,removed,the economy is crashing because theres no money to be made by investing so the rich are just sitting on it which economy are you talking about saved money is still invested and those investments are the reason most of the things you enjoy in life exist but i could be wrong maybe your favorite hobby is sitting in nature and wishing we were all huntergatherers again idk
socialism,removed,there is no defending capitalism except for the quality of life differences between most capitalist countries and the remaining socialist states
socialism,removed,jobs are lost because they are usually positions that are not expected to have high job security
socialism,removed,if anything we need to produce less stuff that is of better longlasting quality that is a surefire way to increase unemployment and drive up the price of goods
socialism,removed,hate to break it to you but capitalism isnt why canada is doing poorly in your words i dont care enough about canada to pay attention to their economy
socialism,removed,i think you literally need to learn what literally means
socialism,removed,maybe if you spent less money getting drunk youd have more to spend making your life less shitty it amuses me when people demand money from others so they can spend it doing shit that doesnt advance anything like alcohol
socialism,removed,take advantage of our countrys tfsa program my contribution has grown since june
socialism,removed,did you know that anywhere between of your wages are being taken for taxes
socialism,removed,da jooz amirite
socialism,removed,literally stealing
socialism,removed,i tested your theory by starting with worlds richest person gates and checking from there if what you said is true well you started for
socialism,removed,it has nothing to do with liberalism its simple mathematics
socialism,removed,no offense but you seem super ignorant of economics and the realities of the world people die man society cant pay an infinite cost doing everything to solve medical issues
socialism,removed,you can go make a lathe any time you want whats stopping you
socialism,removed,they were born in families with generations of stolen wealth the few youre talking about were born into families with a couple of generations of earned wealth wealth usually doesnt survive past even generations
socialism,removed,this is one of the most incredible displays of unintelligence i have ever witnessed
socialism,removed,these economically illiterate socialists make you all look bad the fact that people upvoted this crap shows the majority of this sub is economically illiterate as well the money doesnt just sit there its invested in capital which is why people actually earn a return on their savings savings can be done by individuals or by the government the reason why the soviet union had such spectacular growth in the was saving what this user calls literally stealing money not spending on consumer goods seriously if you want nonsocialists to take you guys seriously you need to actually learn some basic economics this post is so fucking stupid you should all be ashamed and anyone who thinks op is making an even slightly intelligent point should take a step back from your emotional circle jerk and actually learn some economic theory
socialism,removed,well then explain to me why there is no way to earn money in a capitalist society hell in my country even those who sit at home doing nothing receive money from our government
socialism,removed,well if you cant be bothered to build a lathe not sure what good it will do to tell you how to build anything else im assuming you want someone to give you stuff for free
socialism,removed,what is your educational background
socialism,removed,whats bad about icepick jokes unless trot props out directly from the grave i doubt its going to directly alienate someone
socialism,removed,a ceo or stockholder isnt necessarily contributing to society or completing a difficult job equal to the amount he or she is getting paid when compared to someone who makes minimum wage doing back breaking labor a ceo contributes to society by ensuring the company they are managing continues to grow and make a profit they are paid much higher salaries because they are responsible for the well being of the entire company and for the management decisions they make a poor decision making ceo can bankrupt a company effectively putting thousands of people out jobs killing productsservices depended on by peoplecompaniesgovernments and tanking the savings of people who have invested in them a stockholder is not a job so i dont really understand why you threw that in there off the top of my head i cant really think of any back breaking jobs that still pay minimum wage most heavy labor has either been automated or in some cases where it is not possible those positions pay much higher than minimum wage
socialism,removed,it must be nice to see a different point of view an important part of critical thinking is researching both sides of an argument before forming an opinion
socialism,removed,i came from rall and wanted to share my opinion and participate in the discussion id would like to read your counterpoints
socialism,removed,or you can spend less on nonessential things and saveinvest the money left over so you can retire earlier
socialism,removed,but you would be compensated in some fashion someone would administer that compensation and could skim off your wages or you could not be compensated for all of your contributions socialism doesnt make theft impossible
socialism,removed,your sad shell of an empire needs to whither away and die already the kurds are far better than you and actually worth saving
socialism,removed,because the free market has spurred more technology and benefit than any centralized economy could ever hope to achieve say have you heard of my boy pinochet i think you two would get along quite well
socialism,removed,gross
socialism,removed,second generation wealth on the other hand are only living off the fruits of their parents these are the people ive no respect for you dont respect certain people because of the circumstances of their birth got it
socialism,removed,ah look its a communist jackass thats feels entitled to other peoples rewards typical swine
socialism,removed,that edit is so fucking cringey all its missing is a guy fawkes mask
socialism,removed,well its a socialist you expect them to know anything the economy is too stupid for them to understand it
socialism,removed,i save most of the money i earn how am i stealing from you
socialism,removed,theres no money to be made by investing my and ira would disagree
socialism,removed,our little corner of the world where capitalism works sorry to break it to you but we are the majority although most of us vary on what kind of capitalism works or what kind of regulations are necessaryunnecessary most of the world agrees that capitalism works sorry to burst your bubble but true socialists are a minority
socialism,removed,how about instead of shitting on bad ideas we come up with new good ones ill wait
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,monarchism is better than democracy
socialism,removed,afd actually isnt farright but its a strong message from the proletariat nevertheless
socialism,removed,why are you so reactionary
socialism,removed,im so glad ive been subscribed to this subreddit since i was a naive college student socialism is evil celebrating someones death like this is evil you are bad people with a perceived moral high ground
socialism,removed,so take money from everyone to raise your children

socialism,removed,all the commies are mad get a job
socialism,removed,the kkkronstadt sailors were first worldist labour aristocrats
socialism,removed,as a matter of fact we here have socialist cars socialist malls socialist tv channels socialist internet data plans socialist newspapers socialist clothing lines socialist food and a long etc to be honest i find it curious
socialism,removed,also you have to consider that its critical to that entire ideological point of view that they dont think reasonably once logic and facts enter the picture the entire thing collapses it cant survive it so although i appreciate what youre saying you would like you have to understand its not going to happen because to do so would be incredibly selfdestructive for them both on a personal level and collectively is that what you truly believe how painfully pretentious and ignorant sorry for saying
socialism,removed,was richard feynman or einstein in a union fuck no i rest my case
socialism,removed,sure is how are grad students supposed to excel to their level when they are being coddled by unions
socialism,removed,but these women have been brainwashed from birth that females need to be covered up even if they decided to go against this backwards religious practice theres risk of being ostracized or even the threat of death i am no fan of state imposed dress codes but i am also against backwards religious practices that enforce dress codes on women is the left going to defend patriarchy just because its from the currently villainized community
socialism,removed,no because im a fucking moron what kind of question is this i didnt read the rest of your comment because the title was so stupid
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,it isnt a group at all its just and other internet nerds these people arent really racist or sexist they just feel repressed out in the real world and blow off steam on these anonymous boards because they want to feel the freedom of saying racist or sexist shit without the consequences they would face in the real world most of these people are actually young liberals actually went hard for bernie in the primaries though there were some that did use the bernie phonebank for nefarious purposes for the lulz stormfront infiltrated because originally the posters on were pretending to be right wing racists ironically stormfront thought they were serious and came right in most of the original people actually immigrated to reddit when it was first starting out and thats where reddit got its young naive white liberal culture im confused why anyone would want to take trolling that far how old are you if you dont mind me asking its a hate group wether it started from a place of seriousness or not i would disagree in that like anonymous it isnt a group at all its just a label for an amorphous group of people that are constantly entering and leaving the group
socialism,removed,it is your right to self expression and i highly doubt you would be harassed unless you live in a notsogreat area im just wondering why of all the groups you would choose the black panthers
socialism,removed,rac·ism ˈrāˌsizəm noun noun racism the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races essentially its what i described using racist terminology with complete disregard for the people who have been oppressed by racism is racist no it isnt it makes you an asshole it doesnt make you a racist they arent mutually inclusive
socialism,removed,no ableism
socialism,removed,theyre everywhere
socialism,removed,the majority of the population consists of unwanted invaders and settlers lmao as a non communistsomeone on the far right i actually am going to encourage you to tell people that you want to recruit that theyre unwanted invaders and settlers it will drive them straight into my loving arms white supremacy will always exist amongst humans in the same way that human supremacy will exist amongst the species of earth we are better and more developed in every way let me tell you something your ideology is completely unappealing to the vast majority of white people who are the majority of all but one of the countries that actually matters china is the only non white country that actually matters in a geopolitical sense since it is unappealing to white people and no longer has a patron the ussr it will never take root since the countries that actually matter have a material interest in stopping communism any communist movement in the rest of the world will either be used and then sold out like what is happening to the kurds in rojava or ousted via coup too many to list organized popular action like what just happened in my brasil or in more extreme scenarios via western support for anti communist insurgents or even a humanitarian intervention far right beliefsfascism appeal to large parts of the establishmentsrich classes of the places that matter because it staves off communism and it keeps the poor white classes happy because they benefit from increased standing in society and the glorypride of nationalism you can downvote me to hell report me ban me delete this comment or reply with some impotently desperate nuh uh response but you know deep in your filthy communist heart that its true so you can discuss bordiga and trotsky and luxemburg on reddit or go to a rally and wave a red flag you might even campaign for a higher minimum wage and get it but when it comes to actually changing the system and overthrowing capitalism you have a better chance of growing wings 😁😁😁😁😁
socialism,removed,pragers a joke and so is crowder instagulag for both of them
socialism,removed,i would counter that fun experiences eating theater all of that is the good stuff of life its one thing to devote your life to owning mansions around the world it is another thing entirely to devote your life to fun and learning and experiencing things with your limited time here reading about him he strikes me as a deeply miserable angry person who actually longed to have that kind of fun
socialism,removed,the capitalists were right we need to work more not less
socialism,removed,fuck this commie scum sub
socialism,removed,ive got a lot of shit for saying there may be good things to come from trump among the huge amount of bad and this was the main thing i talked about i was called an accelerationist and such but im glad to see true leftists forming in the midst of this our country has lacked a solid left for a while now
socialism,removed,i think thats a separate discussion both issues of moderatorscensorship in this sub and the idea that this sub is being specifically called out are important but i think each requires there own discussion and should not rely on each other has a defense
socialism,removed,ok boy i actually took the time to read the rules and my shitpost is specifically mentioned oh no
socialism,removed,i thought police enforced the laws
socialism,removed,wow this sub fucking sucks
socialism,removed,is this about all the unfair bans
socialism,removed,posting an alternative opinion isnt platforming lol you guys are just like thedonald should we go to askstalinsupporters for actual discussion
socialism,removed,to tell you that you suck
socialism,removed,not in norwayfinland or denmark the sweedish problem is more related to migrant crisis and their politics on acepting foreginsbefore the crisis that is happening now
socialism,removed,your right we cant just hope that people will have enough curiosity or passion to research themselves people have an attention span of seconds after all we should be ready and eager to engage with and convert anyone showing interest
socialism,removed,the dude who got banned was posting in a thread that was full of people discussing and explaining the issue if he cant even read the thread hes posting in then why should we go out of our way even further
socialism,removed,you socialist pigs censor all dissenting opinions as usual socialist cant exist without authoritarianism open debate would destroy your ideas thats why socialist countries always kill the intellectuals off you are scum
socialism,removed,anarchist then my right wing parents swayed me right so i went through a brief libertarian in the stupid quasifascist american sense of that word period then in the later part of high school i discovered marx and ive been on that road all through college i had a high school politics teacher who was a socialist on the down low who challenged me to read things like marx it was the best thing that ever happened to me
socialism,removed,understanding socialism by directing people to not marx great job
socialism,removed,honest question if you dont like people coming here from rall and asking questions why do the mods choose to be listed in rall if this is really just a sub for socialists discussing socialism then it shouldnt be on rall
socialism,removed,it wont make a difference in my experience their egos have been offended
socialism,removed,thats what i try to tell people this place is an echo chamber more of a safe space
socialism,removed,i just think this sub as an audience
socialism,removed,did you see the photo they were commenting on yes did you see the rest of the comment section yes do you have any understanding of the socialist critique of the police yes that comment was not in good faith they may well have not been in good faith but you have no proof of that based solely on a one line comment consisting entirely of a question that any nonradical would ask
socialism,removed,pets allowed two pet maximum limited to felids and canids breed and size restrictions apply no exotic or trade pets pet deposit and nonrefundable pet fee apply pet month of per month for cats and for dogs applies to length of contact
socialism,removed,this just stinks of the dumb prolestrope people dont just give up a fight because someone used an uncommon word ill might just dipout altogether because people that arent from my area dont understand my slang and accent the struggle starts because of the material conditions not words or ideology
socialism,removed,even a broken clock is right twice a day
socialism,removed,as if the racial politics of blm and other groups in and around the democratic party had no influencing on creating the social atmosphere in which this occurred
socialism,removed,it costs a lot to repair pet damages sometimes my dad rents out a bunch of duplexes and he hates pets people dont care about the house cause they only rent it i do agree to an extent that rent is too high on average my dad is always below the neighborhood average but we do all repairs after our day jobs to make up for a lower rent its a lot of work its not up to the owners to accommodate your needs
socialism,removed,communits were not shy to use violence to harm people before
socialism,removed,so where is the father
socialism,removed,if tenants dont care about inconveniencing the owner it shouldnt be hard to understand why some owners dont care about tou
socialism,removed,wow what a cunt cant let people morn for the dead without being an attention whore pure cunt
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,ill tell reactionaries whatever i want thanks
socialism,removed,as a hundred percent of the population i see this as a problem
socialism,removed,it was jihadists who comprised percent of that
socialism,removed,or all jihadists they comprise percent of the people being arrested the right wingers are reactionaries
socialism,removed,yes or all jihadists they comprise percent of the people being arrested the right wingers are reactionaries
socialism,removed,or all jihadists they comprise percent of the people being arrested the right wingers are reactionaries
socialism,removed,oh the poor wittle wacist facts are too much for you sorry white men are the evilness known as lucifer for some reason spinozas god let him walk around and take his natural form of cisness the blessed blacks and muslims are here to save us by blowing us up and murdering us well figure it out man just give us a second tfw socialist as fuck and you cant stand the people who follow your ideology
socialism,removed,this is what happens when you use vox as a source just because some are not muslim extremists does not equal conservative actually most are left leaning anyway fort hood and orlando will swamp all others out by numbers
socialism,removed,so islamic extremism accounts for of homegrown terrorist attacks yet muslims only account for of the us population raw numbers dont tell an accurate story you need scale to realize that there is something fundamental here
socialism,removed,i like the term regressive left perfect term to describe the infantile culture of microaggressions safe spaces and sjw on college campuses
socialism,removed,this word should be reserved for the people who believe that air conditioning is sexist and for those who call for thedie cis scumcrowd
socialism,removed,its quite ridiculous because the left should be fighting against identity politics and pc culture the root of the problem is a fucked up economic system if that doesnt change safe spaces can only cure the symptoms meaning everyone gets to be a special snowflake protected from mean people until they actually step out of that bubble and find out that its not how the world works instead of promoting equality the culture creates new divides people looking for things to be offended by instead of fighting the oppression they make up a fantasy world where it doesnt exist
socialism,removed,ill reply to your last point cause thats the only argument i can find in your post it seems to me that identity politics does exactly what youre saying remember that girl accusing a white student of cultural appropriation because he wore dreadlocks man she really stuck it to the bourgeoisie didnt she
socialism,removed,they broke the law and wasted a lot of peoples time and money they can do a bit of work while they have free meals and heating 😄
socialism,removed,that is not what im saying of course that anything that in any way advances society is beneficial in what way are safe spaces like trade unions may i ask what are the benefits for society if pc people get their way no i cant get behind anyone publicly making racist or sexist jokes but the right to free speech needs to be protected above peoples feelings this is the only way a democracy can work through discussion and people who intentionally try to shut it down should not be commended for it
socialism,removed,i dont mind prison labor so long as the conditions are reasonable and the pay is minimally decent
socialism,removed,the point i was trying to convey maybe i shouldve been more explicit is that i dont think theyre fighting racismhomophobiasexism etc in any meaningful impactful way that extends beyond the bubble of a college safe space its not about slurs as you said those add nothing what theyre doing instead which is being enabled by the universities is silencing any contrarian opinions ie banning speakers now part of being a functioning adult is learning how to deal with people and you may disagree with some of them but you need to hear what they have to say and try to get where theyre coming from to challenge or assure your own beliefs right i may be naive but i believe societal change can come about through reason
socialism,removed,you lost me at patriarchy
socialism,removed,aaaaaand there it is every time i post here this sub reminds me thats insane
socialism,removed,im not sure what youre pointing out that you guys here are so unwilling to have any slight disagreement that you have to downvote ideas slightly different than your own
socialism,removed,tanks
socialism,removed,you spelt unknighted nakkkes of amerikkka wrong
socialism,removed,one of the most misunderstood socialist groups
socialism,removed,advertising rent maintenance stock shipping and paying the sales team are going to eat that up probably paying off a business loan too sorry just passing by from rall
socialism,removed,except taxes and competition
socialism,removed,workers do build a lot but inventing managing financial organizational and other nonphysical skills unrelated to the process of production are highly underrated ownership does little to account for that hence adequate financial compensation
socialism,removed,yet he or she has to respond to shareholders his employees and their issues and company matters often extending all the way down its not for no reason that international company ceos competed severely with each other salary wise its actually a very draining job a hands off approach is hardly ever possible and even assuming youre right this works as long as workers are adequately compensated for their work
socialism,removed,they are free to do so
socialism,removed,ownership obligates working on and caring for what you own the surplus value after all work spent on managing your business is your compensation as there is nobody above to pay you in a way its no different than taking care of a garden
socialism,removed,owning means of production requires no particular skills other than being somewhat aware of your limitations and when to hire other people to do a job as is commonly said you have to be pretty stupid to get poor if you are born rich and you have to be very intelligent to get rich if you are born poor but thats exactly whats happening statistically iirc in a rich family of family wealth is wasted by next generation and is squandered by the third i dont see a problem in working for fair wages and profiting from your businses as such my apologies if i dont see your argument
socialism,removed,no it doesnt some of the richest people on this planet especially those who inherited their wealth many shareholders etc have never worked a single day in their lives give me solid examples i can refute here again you are confusing work with ownership private ownership of the means of production in no way requires you to work as you can always hire people to do that work for you as long as all are paid fair wages for fair work how is that a problem
socialism,removed,often sourced just google wealth lost by second generation iirc source is williams group wealth consultancywealth consuel it is iirc related to the kondratiev cycle httpsenwikipediaorgwikikondratievwave
socialism,removed,true but he took risk investing money into the business
socialism,removed,profit is paying for his own labor
socialism,removed,if that is the case when competition knocks at the door then youre left with no tenants abuse cases are to be frowned upon and those persons ought to be brought to responsibility i agree on that but completely abolishing ownership on that basis sounds like solving a rash on your hand by amputation
socialism,removed,the workers get paid every week to do the job if the business fails theyve made a wage every week but the owner has lost a lot of money i dont believe a true socialist system could function properly outside of theory id prefer somewhere in between
socialism,removed,if the business goes under then the business owner loses all the money he invested if the business goes under then the worker simply loses his job he can get a new one it is a bit harder for the owner to create a new business once he lost a lot of his money also if there is no private profit then what incentive is there to bother why bother to try harder to invent or innovate or risk anything sure the modern ceo greed is a bit much but capitalism has been proven superior
socialism,removed,why would they can you give me any examples of shareholders and owners losing their wealth because they werent working yeah you can see them every day on the stock exchange whatever businesses and workers agree is enough for their work to be input
socialism,removed,id argue that its not exploitation sure in this cartoon the boss is a shitty guy but if all the profit was evenly distributed then no one would ever invest in new things
socialism,removed,inheritance of wealth is related to keeping ownership especially of real estate its more fluid for business because newer generations are less businessfinancesavvyy less so for real estate which i admit is a problem i dont see how bill gates hasnt earned his way to what he owns for instance
socialism,removed,i would welcome to see the study in better detail surname then and surname now is a bit like getting conclusions basing data on google autofill results my apologies i am unconvinced i believe there may be a negative influence of estate ownership which i admit is a problem italy has also a tradition of familyowned businesses which i do not find as a bad thing in itself
socialism,removed,colorizebot
socialism,removed,and i think youre conflating managers owners leaders and bosses theres different level of input and if one earned his way by work and management to invest then i dont see how he is not justified to reap the fruits of his labor to reap the fruits of other peoples labor i fail to see the humor in the latter would you rather live in luxury for no work input
socialism,removed,bill gates didnt force anyone to work for him he created a business worked to make it profitable all the way from scratch then made it ran by others i can see the issue if giving people opportunities to gain wealth and better conditions and obligating wealthy to returnreinvest to the society but i dont see how the very act of ownership is abusive
socialism,removed,that is fair and i do not mind pursuit for productivityprofitdriven wages equally so for fair wealth distribution particularly regarding estate inheritance i just find abolishment of ownership a rather extreme solution to those problems
socialism,removed,they worked their way and earned the money to be in the position to invest the money in other people i dont see how this is exploiting in itself
socialism,removed,any argument you put forth is marred by the fact that every employee has agreed to that wage though right they arnt forced into it that wage doesnt allow you to take over the machine and own it or whatever the boss would be stupid if he agreed to it
socialism,removed,profit is how you expand a business or save for investments or improvements maybe take a risk in a new technology or market or its a return for investors who gave you money to start the business in the first place or its the reason you started the business
socialism,removed,what the hell else are they supposed to do with your system you would put forth everyone would still be poor and hungry as there just isnt enough wealth in that country the system you put forth removes incentive to ever make things better than anyone else and you start stagnating just look at every country that has ever tried any form of this you will never remove the ruling class and the human nature of greed
socialism,removed,it appears youre stuck with your definitions somewhere in the colonial times i will allow myself to disagree
socialism,removed,its almost like inventing a product is more difficult than working a minimum wage job performing menial tasks
socialism,removed,i can understand the pursuit of reduction of inequality and reduction in that surplus if it becomes unjust in market terms however with that approach there is no incentive to produce more than for oneself or to invest for that matter profit exists not only to consume egotistically but also to reinvest so that others may also partake in it or contribute to it so that growth can occur there are many things owned that dont yield profit too
socialism,removed,most owners are also managers who work their fair share as well the problem i see here is that his undermines effective management splitting responsibility for making the business profitable and pushing that onto the entire working collective sounds like a practice which would lower quality of work and level of competition striving for ownershipnot only the company goods and services as well is what drives people after all is that not correct
socialism,removed,and the workers are compensated for their labor the one worker who is usually directly responsible for the profit is often fairly compensated the ceo
socialism,removed,this is certainly one thing that anarchocapitalists like me and you socialist fellows would agree on i guess thats something akin to horseshoe theory huh anyway im just from rall too have a nice day
socialism,removed,honestly it sounds like the same thing really giving group responsibility for something usually means nothing gets properly done management is janky and there is no drive to compete or excel as workers only do their quotas i am all for just wages and treatment and redistribution by reinvestment but not at the sake of growth rights of the individual striving to compete and excel im no business owner but i lived in a country that was communist for years there are lessons to be taken from that rather than boiling down all private ownership to being a slaver is all im saying
socialism,removed,this comic only makes sense if you assume that the owner does zero work now and has done zero work to ultimately own the business
socialism,removed,clearly the worker should by his own machines and start his own business
socialism,removed,socialism ought to seek compromise for all than force down its views on those who dont necessarily agree
socialism,removed,and the workers cant do the work of the ceocfocoo wages arent determined by value they are determined by the market if working a forklift took years to master and managing multimillion dollar businesses was something anyone could do than the compensation would reflect that
socialism,removed,why would one care to manage something thats not his and isnt paid adequately to do so who judges who worked hardest and hence deserves most and has the largest piece of ownership or how would a hour hard worker be compared to a hour slacker sorry if im misunderstanding i just see one collective working and thats democracy and even that one raises many doubts about its efficiency
socialism,removed,democracy and profitproductivity driven wages would be a start imo i can see helping those treated inadequately but not at the cost of those that worked their way and smartly invested to what they have
socialism,removed,well studies show that wealthy families are usually poor by the third generation so a decent portion of these wealthy people arent inheriting it theyre not exploiting anyone if theyre paying the wages required of them people shouldnt expect a good living standard when working a minimum wage job why should the factory worker make more his job is replaceable by basically any worker without any severe disabilities
socialism,removed,yes they should have healthcare their car should be below average
socialism,removed,elites do not need our consumption to be rich
socialism,removed,completely honest and legitimate question is is this subreddit satire
socialism,removed,articles from a critical trotskyist perspective include
socialism,removed,take a blank sheet of paper frame and hang on wall to remind you of all the contradictions and flaws of capitalism or go to venezuela realise socialism is a joke
socialism,removed,blm having shown their credentials as a supremacist terrorist movement have moved into being flagrantly anti semitic too where is pinochet and his helicopters when you need him
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,yup you hit the nail right on the head man all a white guy needs to do is be able to kick a ball straight into an empty net and generations worth of wealth is theirs basically if they can make it to without self immolating andor becoming addicted to crystal meth they can just lay back and start collecting their wpf checks
socialism,removed,mainly because they do cause all their own problems we dont make them have a fuck ton of kids with different baby daddies who leave or end up in prison they are also the same ones at the casino pissing away their govt checks that we have to pay to them because they cant get a real job majority of peoples problems are their own doing
socialism,removed,ya i could walk around and do whatever the fuck i wanted and if anyone questioned me i would yell racist and continue doing what i wanted ya sounds real difficult
socialism,removed,its funny how i grew up in a rural area with my fuck up friends encouraging me to do dumb shit constantly and i made it out and created a nice life for myself i guess i should check my white privilege instead of appreciating my family caring for me and teaching me that i can strive if i try in this country btw i love rollins but not on this
socialism,removed,yeah what a piece of shit rudy is he cleaned up a cell pool of a city and was there during the hardest time the city ever faced go drink some clorox and tell me how it tastes
socialism,removed,are you guys aware that in years of you will have moved to the right of bernie and of you will declare themselves conservative it is a pattern among young radical leftists you should be aware of
socialism,removed,the terrorists that kill frenchmen are not just going to kill civilians in mosul they kill frenchmen for a reason theyre not garden variety psychopaths or serial killers theyre terrorists killers with an agenda as far as the hypothetical french government is concerned the justification and problem solved is that french lives are being saved the french governments primary interest is and must be to protect its own citizens every other countrys citizens are a second priority
socialism,removed,hoping it wasnt isis so that people wont be more inclined to profile muslims is fine hoping it wasnt isis because that would be inconvenient to your political agenda is kind of heartless and despicable
socialism,removed,im not a brigadier and ive downvoted nobody all ill say is that if your comrade really meant the former he ought to have chosen better phrasing
socialism,removed,gulag for you
socialism,removed,oh yeah the old capitalist mainstream media god what a bunch of selfish pigs amirite guys not marxists at all guys move along bernie bernie bernie bring back stalin he was such a great man who cares about the million dead people gulags werent so bad sheesh
socialism,removed,makes sense this quote would come from someone who has been shot in the head
socialism,removed,jajajaja theyre the villains not you right
socialism,removed,we the people made it happen lets be clear you had nothing to do with it and neither did anyone else whose only form of protesters angry reddit and facebook comments this happened because of the people on the ground not because of reddit and not you
socialism,removed,this didnt change anything theyre repeating the same study theyve already done until everyone focuses on something else in two years time this thing will be operational and youll never hear another word silly idealist hippies
socialism,removed,explotation funny seeing as how socialism revolves around the direct theft of productive members of societys wealth voluntary transactionexploitation but state sanctioned theft is aok lets be clear not a socialist here to debate not troll
socialism,removed,go figure socialist whinnying about work even in socialists societys work still needs to be done and people still have to get up early on mondays
socialism,removed,and how well did their little fight for the working class turn out how well did the gulags turn out
socialism,removed,fascism here we come
socialism,removed,its fascism d
socialism,removed,theres nothing wrong with fascism you know
socialism,removed,pros it sounds good in theory it has lead to some things that should be public like education and healthcare cons theres never been a successful socialist society everything it wishes to accomplish fascism does better
socialism,removed,nothing wrong with fascism yourmatchmyfire
socialism,removed,hey our army is good
socialism,removed,i am ok with religion if its a personal practice that doesnt encroach on free society the catch is that religion almost always leads to exactly that with demands for special treatment such as discrimination towards those they consider unholy islam is probably the biggest danger to this world at the moment given its prevalence towards theocratic fascism however we should ensure that irrational fear is fought against as it represents fascism as it always single out a minority or ethnic group the solution is quality education and often that leads to diminished focus on religion as critical reasoning and analysis will naturally dwindle belief in nonsensical fairy tales as a guide of morality
socialism,removed,its nice to see so many people care about water issues in north dakota i assume youll all be back in the spring to help out when sandbagging is needed or the next time a flood devastates a town like what happened to minot in donations of money and clothes and food will pour into the state right
socialism,removed,you keep talking about the role of the state in revolution so then what when the revolution is had has there ever been a working example of workers controlling society
socialism,removed,its not my fault that they deny reality i would be socialist if it was something i thought could be successful the reality is it never was and everyone here is conveniently ignoring that there are plenty examples of it failing and the reasons why but none of the opposite i came here to get some views are people here aware of its failings and shortcomings or are they just stubborn and are driven something else like their hate for capitalism etc how do you see socialism working i want to have a debate to see if your idea for socialism would realistically work
socialism,removed,liberals are basically socialists today idk what youre talking about do you mean libertarians anyway honey my family lived in soviet society from ever since its inception i was born under it my mom had to wait for bread hours in line daily just so she could get some wet bread when she was pregnant with me she was literally starving to death ive heard all the praise its given especially by them when it quote on quote worked but also i understand the massive failings there is a reason none of those places are socialist anymore can you tell me what that reason is also thanks for the resources
socialism,removed,what is your view on socialism and how do you see it achieving success
socialism,removed,and both are awful places to live and the quality of life is shit and it only works because of the chaos it spawned in do you deny this
socialism,removed,yes answer me why capitalism has won why has capitalism prospered and former soviet nations are now under capitalistic models not because the bourgeoisie has more resources or man power capitalism won because socialism only works when there is a gun to your head
socialism,removed,dont do this dont veer into obscurity you dont understand human nature socialism only works when greed is totally eviscerated from human nature when everyone runs solely on passion until that point its going to be the same thing it always is corrupt morally depraved and driven by coercion its impossible when humanity reaches a point where socialism would work it already wont be necessary
socialism,removed,if only clinton had gotten more votes than trump

socialism,removed,fuck you this will get built even if i need to burn every last indian alive
socialism,removed,lol have fun with your soup lines and welfare commies the worlds leaving big government behind and the loosers who depend on it will have to get actual jobs fuck socialisim
socialism,removed,this false dichotomy that the media has created between liberals and in this case socialists is a distraction who ever said capitalism is the preferred economic solution for liberals or that liberals were antisocialism ive always been liberal and ive always believed capitalism in this country to have been used as a tool by the financial elites to empower and enrich themselves to the exclusion of everyone else liberal and conservative are works that describe political points of view capitalism socialism and communism are economic systems you can mix and match theyre not on the same axis of the chart they are what is called nonorthogonal dont manufacture conflict when there is none
socialism,removed,i think theres more to elons boards efforts than that spacex is well poised in case we need to export to mars and then lease atmosphere there the concept is about as capitalist as you can get but i argue that people will prefer lower levels here tesla also hires phd level talent from china and other affordable gradstudentlevel institutions just look at their patent inventors surnames theyre doing wacky gradschoollevel stuff on a factory floor their sheet metal patents are covering technology that ten years ago was limited to thesisdesperate students just trying to get some idea to work on a piece of tin foil so they could get the hell out if anything im worried about the level of desperate admiration because i dont want it to go to their heads we need empowered and good paying jobs and sure effective use of substantial taxes industrial efforts seem an effective requisite
socialism,removed,god damn you are just delusional sad
socialism,removed,capitalism and socialism both suck the fact is capitalism just works even if it works shitty youre still able to have decent quality of life for a lot of people with socialism it always comes down to human nature wanting more when humanity evolves enough spiritually for socialism to work it already wont be needed until then every socialism try would only work in already extremely poor countries and if moral depravity depravity and coercion dont destroy it then human nature will
socialism,removed,lets run with your analogy the ends are the same or years out automated trucks replace much of the transportation industry leaving millions jobless what is the difference how is their joblessness any different under socialism let me just say that i am a libertarian i got here from rall and im staying for hopefully a meaningful discussion that said i am aware that this is the socialism subreddit and i fully expected these downvotes

socialism,removed,coughkronstadtcough
socialism,removed,my point is that you and comrade joe can keep high fiving every day until capitalist joe puts you out of business if you run a socialist bakery in a capitalist nation you will fail and if you have a socialist country in a capitalist world you will also fail this is because capitalism seeks the most efficient solution while socialism seeks the easiest
socialism,removed,decent people dont spend all their time on the internet
socialism,removed,youre a paranoid faggot and a hall monitor for the current system facebook and twitter supports your faggot shit
socialism,removed,bernie literally got cucked by the dnc begs for more sad
socialism,removed,so youre pouting like a brat for being told youre being a brat and deliberately surrendering to an authoritarian strongman relying on a cult of personality solution quit being a fucking brat decide whether you want hillary or donald because one of them is going to be your next president vote that way keep fighting for what you want in future primaries also look up overton window in your spare time also look up existence of republican party theyre people that think both of us are full of shit primary the hell out of their politicians and want to unload an authoritarian strongman on us theyre eating your lunch in local and state elections and if they get to pick the next round of supreme court decisions the roberts court will be remembered as a bastion of liberalism tired of you whiny shitbabies most of you sat home in because obama wasnt liberal jesus and you still couldnt acknowledge republican shenanigans and let them wipe us out in congress preventing many changes and reforms liberals would have wanted grow the fuck up put on your helmets and get out there and fight the battle in front of your face or keep whining about getting lectured brat your choice
socialism,removed,we dont have parliamentary legislature in america and we likely never will our reality is a two party system in major elections the party that splits loses we use primaries to cull our preferred members of that party third parties in a national presidential election are not a real option theyre psychological defense mechanisms
socialism,removed,to the manufacture of simple firearms and explosives for guerilla warfare to how to communicate and organize secretly seriously
socialism,removed,you know that thing you do where you psychically try to figure out the biographies of strangers on the internet you suck at it nor will i humor you by educating you about me im not going to simmer down because you keep demanding respect when youre dancing around in candyland while actual elections that affect peoples lives get thrown in order to satisfy your purity fix im not going to accept that you acknowledge the existence of the republican party when you only do it to admire their primary successes and then ignore everything they do when they get power im not going to accept your assertion that i am not trying to fix the problem because the time to fix the problem is in the primary bernie damn near got it in a candidacy that would not have been possible if obama had not given us eight years of leftward pressure normalizing concepts like universal health care were still trying to shake off the detritus of the reagan age and its adherents and youre trying to return us to the fractured state that allowed reagans ascendancy and turned liberal into a curse word it took twenty years to get that word back what were you doing to help as far as postrevolution political executions go try your best not to remind me that too many shithead liberals still admire che and fidel fascism im talking about a free system in competition with other people who disagree with you you seem to dream of it and id be on your execution list but perhaps im wrong and youre merely careless in your language no one wants to follow me your problem is you cant get enough people to follow you so youll try to sink the whole system yeah try to paint a picture where dictator trump gets toppled and we turn to you do that for me include the part where you dont start turning on liberals for not being pure enough what you can actually do in this world in this system is give hillary a congress that walks and talks like bernie elizabeth and the other good ones send her bills that do something real to make health care and education available for all to reduce wage slavery to empower employees and require more profit sharing right now the plan of you shitbabies sounds like im gonna vote jill stein and sit around with a smug smirk while trump rapes the country yeah youve got it worked out how youre going to blame others but doesnt every guilty bastard sure ive got it worked out too im not going to be responsible for trump because i voted against the fucker and you will be because you didnt vote for the only other actual real option hillary clinton the way things are going she will win handily and you will be able to skate along with your smug selfsatisfaction that you were able to vote third party or not at all and not face any real life consequences for it its all fun and games until a republican takes away your health care closes your local school strips you of your marriage rights takes control of all wombs poisons your water and cranks up the global thermostat but you dare to talk about being offered nothing there are the soldiers on your side who arent fighting the way you want or as effectively as you and then there are the bastards shooting at you most liberals get this and theres just you deadenders mucking about in fantasyland who cant tell which is which bernie earned my respect and now hes doing the right thing solidifying my opinion of him as a hero i will concentrate my energies on trump supporters but any time you want to pull your head out of your ass and join the fight against them youre welcome to do so til the next primary
socialism,removed,trump is calling for lowering the minimum wage hillary is calling for eventually raising it to an hour but nothing for working class people sure whatevs youll feed them unicorn meat and im actually a libertarian socialist like chomsky for the most part i make a clear distinction between socialism and fascist communism unlike some people in this forum when i see people calling themselves socialists but excluding liberals i have to wonder what your real agenda is is it smashing a free system and establishing yourselves as the ultimate power like the dipshit chefidel fanboys
socialism,removed,i understood and acknowledged the error that does not mean i projected the longwinded biography of me that was written out of thin air was complete horseshit and remains so projection involves the accusation being false but the rock clearly hit you whelping dog

socialism,removed,what exactly makes trump a fascist
socialism,removed,hillarys doing an ama
socialism,removed,wow i didnt know bernie was doing an ama
socialism,removed,she sounds legally retarded
socialism,removed,feminism has also made a second contribution to the neoliberal ethos in the era of stateorganised capitalism we rightly criticised a constricted political vision that was so intently focused on class inequality that it could not see such noneconomic injustices as domestic violence sexual assault and reproductive oppression rejecting economism and politicising the personal feminists broadened the political agenda to challenge status hierarchies premised on cultural constructions of gender difference the result should have been to expand the struggle for justice to encompass both culture and economics but the actual result was a onesided focus on gender identity at the expense of bread and butter issues worse still the feminist turn to identity politics dovetailed all too neatly with a rising neoliberalism that wanted nothing more than to repress all memory of social equality in effect we absolutised the critique of cultural sexism at precisely the moment when circumstances required redoubled attention to the critique of political economy feminism may have lead the way but there are other social movements that followed closely behind isnt interesting how identity politics slots so neatly into neoliberalism
socialism,removed,ayy lmao
socialism,removed,the definition is changing over time with more emphasis on it being a range of characteristics not a binary aspergers is no longer a separate thing but a part of the autism spectrum spectrum is still too simple its really many spectra of overlapping characteristics all normal natural human characteristics but the values are on far ends of various bell curves values related to social emotional development communication skills reaction to external stimuli inner lives etc its hard to nail down because theres no set divider between normal and autistic its just the point at which a kids guardians and doctors decide so the autism rate has raised dramatically and its still a big question if the rate is going up from some realworld change or if its simply being diagnosed more often i think theres more of the latter than the former same with adhd an insidious disease which now plagues some of us boys in a few southern states bull fucking shit if you ask me

socialism,removed,assuming the really are going to repeat themselves to say nothing of climate change isnt it about time we started distributing suicide pills or teaching reliable methods sure trumps mandate may turn out to be just another unmitigated tragedy but his election seems like a good indication that nothing ever changes for the better and that death remains the best way to escape from capitalism
socialism,removed,liberals are the cucks of the left
socialism,removed,unfortunately the answer to this problem came in the form of a billionaire stirring up racial tension for his own personal gain another failure of the left the left is not responsible for donald trump trump picked the gop to run with and they embraced him over others who were more moderate and much more sane the truly liberal candidate was bernie sanders who sadly did not get enough support from voters partially because of how the primary system is set up sanders had a lot of support from independents who were not allowed to vote in the primary in most states i agree with some of your other points but i want to point out that trump talked about draining the swamp but then broke his campaign promise only hours after learning of his election by electoral college controlled by the swing states it was swing states that told us what president we would have trump has invited the crooked scum of the earth to be part of his cabinet including jamie dimon the architect of the crash and head of jp morganchase there will be no justice with this trump but liberals didnt choose him the neoconservatives did and they love him talk to them because it was their votes that made this man their fuhrer
socialism,removed,ah but there was a movement and that movement was derailed not by the left but by the right the right own the media corporations that we all see and hear the reason why so many independents went to trump is because the media ignored sanders and hyped trump with a billion in free advertising propaganda works goebbels proved it iowans didnt vote for sanders so their like of the term didnt translate into votes and thats what matters not whether they are comfortable with the term the media ignored the huge crowds that sanders was pulling in they focused on trump and held up clinton as the only savior the propaganda is just beginning we now have a president who calls global climate change a chinese hoax we are going to have another great depression but at least trump will have his early unlike bush the gop own this goon and his rise to power the left had nothing to do with it
socialism,removed,are you suggesting the liberalism and socialism are mutually exclusive i supported bernie sanders candidacy as did nearly all of my friends im not really clear but you seem to be bashing liberals and blaming us for the outcome of this election and i dont get why youre doing that
socialism,removed,so as a liberal who voted for bernie sanders a self described democratic socialist how was i fooled by identity politics
socialism,removed,i agree with no ceos i think work should not be gender specific im still a liberal how was i fooled again
socialism,removed,so there is no possibility that sanders voters who were bummed out that he didnt win the primaries saw that trump was far worse than they could have imagined and voted for clinton because they didnt want orange mussolini can you point to specific policies of clintons that you disagree with i can think of a few im just curious about your list
socialism,removed,youre confusing liberalism with right wing propaganda half the country drunk on propaganda from the right voted for the corporate candidate instead of the career politician because they were told to fear government since reagan talked that line it was conservatives that ravaged small town america and successfully blamed it on the liberals their jobs left because of right wing policies under reagan and bush and son clinton created million jobs the largest of any president people are not reacting to facts but lies spewed by the right and part of that is that liberals all suck just because im not a radical doesnt mean that liberals are to blame for the hatred during this election cycle that was not generated by liberals i agree with some ideas from the far left but blaming moderate liberals for everything is no different than what neocons do you have to work with facts and speak the truth and the facts are that people stayed home because they wanted bernie sanders but couldnt get him and thats not their fault corporations and big money colluded to stop the bernie revolution not liberals bernie sanders was not on their teevee so it didnt happen
socialism,removed,some of what you mention i knew of and was not very happy about clinton was not my first choice but then i didnt have much choice and neither did you if you voted for sanders good on yah if you saw him lose and saw what trump was and then didnt vote or didnt vote for clinton then you gave the right wing exactly what they wanted and you played right into their greedy corporate hands and youre about to experience a time far worse than bush or nixon and possibly worse then reagan and maybe just maybe worse than hoover you have also succeeded in killing my son so you should be proud of yourself for that take credit and own it this disaster is yours because you wouldnt back the only sane alternative to absolute tyranny the choice was between what you just mentioned and the next mussolini saying anything else is just bullshit pie in the sky blathering bullshit to make yourself feel better when you look in the mirror you cannot wash your hands of this you helped to make this happen not me i did my job to save what is left of this republic and you want us to die starting with my son are you willing to hold my sons six year old hand with me while he dies what are you gonna tell him are you gonna quote some radical bullshit ideology that isnt going to happen without violent revolution what the fuck will that matter to me and my son about your fucking bruised feelings about being accurately called a deplorable for not pulling your head out of your own ass and saving democracy how are you okay with having voted for jamie dimon over elizabeth warren youre so full of shit you make me sick
socialism,removed,then the group is using the term wrong and you should own it modern definitions of liberalism are not at all the same as economic liberalism which is vastly different and in many respects quite opposite httpsenwikipediaorgwikieconomicliberalism there has to be a better way of expressing your misgivings about the election than blaming the very people that tried their hardest to prevent this outcome this kind of confusion is not helpful if in fact this is what you mean
socialism,removed,your fallacy is that you think that hillary clinton and the dnc represent the left this doesnt alter the fact that americans like yourself bought into the propaganda regarding this entire election and it didnt alter the extreme position of the right wing starting with ronald reagan bernie sanders represented the left not hillary clinton this was not the doing of the liberals in america it was the doing of the right wing who have pushed politics hard to the right for more than three decades the propaganda against clinton was not created by clinton or the dnc and a good chunk of that was so extreme as to be incredulous to clear thinking people average americans bought into it however because propaganda works goebbels proved it
socialism,removed,this bitch looks half white why is she trying to play the minority victim card
socialism,removed,this is petty and stupid already trump has toned down his election promises hes not going to round up all minorities and send them to work on the wall before theyre gassed to death jesus at least wait until after the first days before you make any attempt to impeach him
socialism,removed,snopes is garbage and was pushing hillary propaganda during the election theyre hardly a credible source
socialism,removed,trump is not hitler fucking get over it jesus christ bernie lost
socialism,removed,party system
socialism,removed,self defense requires courage and personal responsibility which is against the rules some socialists with jobs may be able to afford gun ownership however they could never use one as intended
socialism,removed,there would be no reason for progress growth requires resistance which is forbidden in socialism
socialism,removed,way to go you whiny little bitch you guys should have all brought your participation trophies and had a big bonfire you are not entitled to anything you are just a group of spoiled whiny little bitches
socialism,removed,do you people really see socialism as something good
socialism,removed,to achieve nothing but make those in power look better trump looks more like a politician his opponents the protesters look more like petulant children
socialism,removed,fighting back against the winning candidate isnt that ironic trump is a product of people getting tired and angered by political correctness and all the shit white males have been getting over the last few years and so they fight back and radically choose an outsider candidate now all these hillary supporters trying to choose a candidate that they see as more years of obama more years of the same are trying to build the fightback you always want to sound like a victimized underdog dont you
socialism,removed,do you usually pay for your exs medical expenses

socialism,removed,class cucks
socialism,removed,the bitterness is strong young skywalker
socialism,removed,im not as optimistic as him but he does have a point with the far right losing steam
socialism,removed,his views on islam dont look too promising either oh shit he doesnt like fascist ideologies not my comrade
socialism,removed,its illiberal intolerant patriarchal authoritarian and totalitarian militarist imperialist and antijudaist to boot and there are countless verses and hadiths to prove it especially those from the medinan period take a look at the atrocities muhammad ordered and remember that he is the ideal for all muslims to strive for and that his laws were explicitly meant to be timeless and unchangeable there are few things isis actually exaggerates or gets wrong about islam most of their laws are accurate and in accordance with islamic teachings they focus on the teachings from the later stages of muhammads life when he rose to power and began to war and conquer sure you can get a more liberal islam by ignoring all those parts and focusing on the less fascist ones but at the end of the day isis is as much a part of islam as any liberal interpretation is point is if you want islam to no longer be associated with fascist tenets you need to reform it and abolish the literalist interpretations that form the basis of political islam
socialism,removed,youre an idiot im asking why a stupid banner is getting so much attention and youre apparently now wellenough informed about my priorities to lecture me on them im offended by you dumbass not the stupid banner the banner is insignificant to me well you are too i suppose
socialism,removed,well how many more tenets of fascism does it need to fulfill to be fascist id argue it is just as bad or worse than fascism women are more oppressed under modern day saudi arabia than they were under nazi germany muhammad conducted ethnic and religious cleansing he conquered and enslaved members of other tribes kept women as sex slaves there was no such thing as sexual consent in marriage women owed sex to their husbands and if they didnt theyd be beaten muhammad also wouldnt let his thirteen wives go outside by themselves and under islam women inherit half as much as men
socialism,removed,any protester who thinks this banner will lead to fascists killing themselves is a complete moron this sub appears to be populated by idiots and
socialism,removed,im sure that powerful logic will work well on them good luck with all that you bright shining socialists
socialism,removed,triggered
socialism,removed,what is context come on know post the rest of the video the entire conference so people can actually see what these evil nazis are saying and be better prepared to fight them right
socialism,removed,fuck off fake leftist scum capitalism lovers must be killed
socialism,removed,in this case a pipe bomb would clear the problem up rather quickly
socialism,removed,i was a pacifist until this election but some of these fascists need to commit suicide by gunshot to the back of the head
socialism,removed,lack of funds to acquire contraceptive methods then dont have sex lack of education concerning what constitutes a good contraceptive method even yo girls know that if a man ejaculates into your vagina youre gonna be pregnant its not rocket science lack of full cognitive abilities when the act is consumed fucking while a bit tipsy a day after pill doesnt care that you had sex while drunk lack of access to affordable contraceptive methods how often does this happen to an average woman that she cant afford a pill one pill if youre in such a bad economic situation that getting a day after pill is this huge deal then you should probably be working on getting out of that economic situation instead of having sex a sudden lack of funds which would make raising the child a nightmare plan ahead we arent animals we can plan our future any other reason which the person carrying the baby desires since its her body and nobody should tell her how it should be used but it is not her body the baby has of the genetic material of the both parents i dont see how a baby is her body in any way thats not how life works did you skip grade biology or something a woman doesnt have a printer in her womb that makes the baby layer by layer she doesnt make the baby at all thats not how life works the baby makes itself life grows on its own the woman is nothing more but an environment in which the baby grows and something that feeds the baby while its growing the baby is a separate thing and at best its only half of the mother nobody should tell her how it should be used if shes so concerned with bodily autonomy maybe she should learn some self responsibility because she didnt care much about what was happening to her body up until the moment she got pregnant until then she was being thrown around like a jizzed up tumbleweed in the wind with no care in the world im so perplexed how you people believe youre correct by default making it really hard for somebody to fully use their body autonomy is oppressive pregnancy doesnt happen by random chance you have full body autonomy to avoid getting pregnant if you do not want to be pregnant and for someone so concerned about body autonomy you sure dont give a single shit about babys body autonomy and before you start with its just a clump of keep in mind that in canadaa country many of you masturbate to practically a woman is legally allowed to murder her own unborn child on the day it was supposed to be born at that point the baby is fully formed but yet it is legal for a mother to murder it in fact in most late term abortions and they constitute a good part of total abortions the baby is so fully formed that the doctormurderer needs to shove scissors up the womans vagina to cut the babys neck arms and legs before pulling it out sure sounds like youre concerned with body autonomy right as to why its such a big issue i wonder how you would feel if all men were forced legally to father and care for at least one child funny you should mention that because while woman is legally allowed to murder her child a man cant even financially abort his child there are couple of cases when you get pregnant both the woman and the man want a child they have the child the man wants a child but the woman doesnt want a child she is legally allowed to abort that child with no concern for the man or the child for that matter the woman wants a child but the man doesnt want a child she can have a child and legally force the man to pay for it nothing he does short of running from the country cant help him avoid to pay for the child he did not want for the next years of his life see anything wrong there its like the woman is the only one who benefits the baby gets murdered the man either cant have any say whether or not his baby is going to die if he wanted a child or cant have any say whether or not he will support a child if he didnt want a child really makes you think doesnt it
socialism,removed,if youre a minority in this country right now i only have this to say to you buy a gun smh you guys are psycho hypocrites downvote me idc this is bullshit and anyone stupid enough to listen to you is going to get hurt you morons saw a meme about texas anarchists with guns on rall and now youre all about violence and guns fuck this sub
socialism,removed,youre fascist because you want safe spaces and counter protest nazi rallies report people who are socialist so we can send them away grab your ppshs comrades weve got some gulags to fill
socialism,removed,demand gendertransition healthcare coverage the fuck these people need mental healthcare not for us to pay for cosmetic surgeries
socialism,removed,we absolutely will not be taken seriously if this kind of shit is propagated in our movement
socialism,removed,theyre even using this sub to advertise their rape cult
socialism,removed,i feel like this attitude is why we lose and why the left is weak do you think working with an undemocratic group of elitist hypocrites with unaccountable rapists in it makes us strong
socialism,removed,awesome gotta balance out the progressives
socialism,removed,the nazis were a socialist anti government structure back in their day and we all know how that turned out destroying economic boundaries doesnt seem to help alleviate oppression at all and if we wait for the revolution it could very well be not the right revolution in other words im as stuck as you are
socialism,removed,you do realize you can be socialist and racistsexist right
socialism,removed,great plan only take professors you agree with that way you never have your ideas challenged
socialism,removed,wait this is not a requirement
socialism,removed,you reject that a socialist can be racist
socialism,removed,can a capitalist be racist
socialism,removed,why is your members so adamant about denying rape in their org and try their best at covering it up
socialism,removed,send to be mostly about exposure of people that are biased its not like they have any influence to have professors removed so what is the problem with this
socialism,removed,prime example of why people dont like you
socialism,removed,i wouldnt use despair to describe how i feel upon realizing that fascism is winning its closer to joy
socialism,removed,point me to the definition that says the working class should rise up and seize the means of production unless they are niggers then they can go to hell and should be exploited socialism is primarily a class struggle and splitting your class by race or gender or sexual orientation etc is not only not socialist its actively counterproductive to the aims of the broader movement and its pretty obvious that racism and the divide it creates serves capitalist interests explicitly and is directly countersocialist its not like this has not been addressed as far back as marx you see recognition that racism serves the interests of capital by lowering overall costs of labor the implication obviously being that racism is bad from any anticapitalist point of view
socialism,removed,never respect the preferred pronouns of a fascist
socialism,removed,so the word crazy is a racistclassist slur are you kidding me nobody will take the movement seriously if this kind of oversensitive bullshit is spread the word isnt even exclusively used to denounce people as mentally handicapped but has a variety of other meanings like absurd or wild
socialism,removed,exactly what the other poster who responded to you said there are much more important things to focus on like the word crazy i absolutely support standing up for the rights of the disabled but i dont care at all if someone is offended by a commonly used word that has numerous applications beyond what you are claiming to be derogatory
socialism,removed,hahahaha the only professor listed at my university was an anthropology professor and a damn good one at that she taught intro level courses so its somewhat unsurprising that some idiot conservative was upset that she exposed him to a different worldview she not a socialist in any way people are so stupid
socialism,removed,you sound like a fascist yourself advocating political violence the entire reason we fight against fascism is so we can debate ideas and collectively decide upon them without fear of oppression and violence you are just advocating for leftist colorblind fascism the only reason the nazis were able to oppress communism and declare it illegal was because they were allowed to use political violence dont think allowing political violence wont open the door for new oppressive views come to power we should be happy that our only problem is loud but powerless racists
socialism,removed,rshitliberalssay
socialism,removed,its not about the ideas being accepted mate the german state employed all the old middle class monarchists army officers etc to form the freikorps who went around crushing resistance the reason they did it is because the communists and the working class posed an actual threat to bourgeois rule to think that itd be any different in modern times is foolish to think the bourgeoisie more enlightened than in history is an absolutely fatal error
socialism,removed,fascists categorically reject the idea of violence as an inherent form of evil they intentionally celebrate violence as a means of national unification and a part of their deepseated love for conflict and struggle so when we speak of resisting fascism we are always speaking of a resistance to violence resisting violence is often violent in itself but it is not aggression it is self defense
socialism,removed,are they bigots for denouncing violence i dont see how they come off as hateful when they compare political violence to genocide
socialism,removed,rooster didnt dox anyone he didnt even make the post that was deemed doxxing stop slandering people without knowing what actually happened
socialism,removed,people were calling for genocide go see for yourself on rsubredditcancer ill probably be banned for this like i care but at least one person will know the truth
socialism,removed,arguing with liberals feels worse than gulag
socialism,removed,what are you even talking about youre delusional
socialism,removed,the odds of you being shot by cops are insanely slim especially as a black man you have a higher chance of being killed by a black male literally this dude was clearly flipping his shit because he was high as fuck on something and hes running around fighting cops he probably couldnt tell they were cops maybe he thought they were pretending to be cops saw a lady do that once when she was on something
socialism,removed,whoa you are definitely right is some situations but you make it sound like every single time a black person interacts with cops they end up dead you realize this doesnt happen most of the time obviously is does happen way to much and obviously is a problem but the majority of the time it does not the fact that this topic is being talked about is a great thing the reality is that cops dont get the training they need and are not punishment adequately when they abuse their power but abuse of power is a problem in every aspect of american culture right now its being acknowledged which is the first step to finding a cure
socialism,removed,this is what happens when you only get news from leftist sites like here and nowhere else you are spoon fed only one narrative of enforcement
socialism,removed,couldnt agree more any death is to much unfortunately when there is a gun on the table death is nearly impossible to stop completely
socialism,removed,all caterpillars are bugs
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,it has not been talked about at the scale it is being talked about today riots have not been happening every time a black man is killed for decades come on how would we keep relative peace if it was not for police im very interested in your response who would investigate your mothers murder if it was not for police
socialism,removed,a mixed economy still plays by the rules of capitalism it runs on a market and profits the value of goods and accumulation of capital would still drive the economy even nationalized industries would have to operate within the market
socialism,removed,i think a mixed market is better than a completely free market but a socialist economy devoid of a market or ability to accumulate capital is even better
socialism,removed,you are lumping the majority with the minority this is just as bad as being racist yet your are being up voted and i am down voted for explaining that not every single interaction with police ends with unnecessary death if this is what rsocialism is about im out
socialism,removed,we need to seize the police departments disarm officers of all their guns relieve them all of duty and run it ourselves
socialism,removed,so instead of reforming how and what cops can and cant do your answer is to eliminate them all so who is going to stop someone from breaking into your house or who is going to find the person who murders your mother ect ect i asked someone else this and they didnt answer i really look forward to your response
socialism,removed,i dont understand how this entire movement doesnt care about facts and statistics white on black murder is a fraction of black on white murder percentages of suspects killed when police respond to violent crime are lower amongst blacks compared to whites
socialism,removed,you know what really gets to me about this i wake up everyday and go to my shitty job like nearly every other person on this planet i make breakfast shower get the bus with all the other assholes i come home clean the apartment make dinner and watch tv its no one gives a fuck what color you are stop playing the victim card and stop making skin colour an excuse for the short comings of your community
socialism,removed,what the fuck is going on here

socialism,removed,if you actually did your homework you would know those were all completely justified events stalins deportations happened because the deported were full of counterrevolutionaries and nazi collaborators the issues during the glf were not the problems of mao but due to a complex list of socioeconomic issues that preceded even the chinese revolution the kims dont have a racist ideology stop reading western bourgeois sources on the dprk and for everything else

socialism,removed,i gave specific examples of positions i find better you are free to disagree and i would be happy to engage with you on any disagreement but i am not a member of the party so this type of polemics is not particularly interesting to me
socialism,removed,the fda has blocked out competition effectively making it a monopoly they can charge what they want wont change until more comparable products are introduced into the market

socialism,removed,american capitalist here poking around after a bernie supporter friend of mine mentioned this sub i wouldnt use the word justified but american capitalism exists to support above all things individual freedom and liberty america was essentially founded on the belief that every individual has natural rights which are not granted by any government or external force but a system of laws must exist to protect those rights as such capitalism formed as the economic system which promotes individual rights to upwards mobility consumer choice right to compete in a free and fair market etc since an individuals rights such as right of private property cannot be guaranteed without a system of laws and recourse for perpetrators a government was well defined in the constitution to fill that role and as such capitalism cannot exist without a government system contrary to popular belief capitalists arent in favor of no government but rather are against government actions which violate individual rights and liberties of which the capitalist system depend this often means we are in favor of a limited well defined federal government with more power delegated to individual state governments since they can more accurately protect the rights and interests of their residents theres more detail i could go into but thats the basics summed up from an actual american capitalists point of view i would also point out that we no longer have the capitalist system i described but rather a mixed system and what most capitalists and conservatives are fighting for today is the restoration of the american capitalist system
socialism,removed,all of this is bullshit and divisive in our current state the only thing that matters is class conciousness if you are rich enough being a woman black trans hated ethnic group etc does not matter the only thing that matters is the class struggle for that we need solidarity that will raise everyone we could deal with other issues after but it means nothing while the class division remains

socialism,removed,thumbnail looks like a buckethead fright mask
socialism,removed,whats your policy on the unnameable revolutionary human animal hybrids
socialism,removed,of course not that would defeat the point of the policy they want you to get in the habit of obedience the point is to make you question every word you type not to consider whether its true or whether it furthers the cause but whether its in line with their dictates this is best served by leaving the policy unclear so that you err on the side of caution in honor of the george orwell quote im seeing on the sidebar id suggest using doubleplus ungood in place of any negative words
socialism,removed,conspritards say we already have assange this justifies us having him in custody to late tho he ruined the election hope he rots in a blacksite
socialism,removed,keep this shit out of here
socialism,removed,makes sense to ban a communist party because communism is bad if any point is going to be made here its that a liberal democratic party of all parties should be focusing on enhancing freedom of speech for its citizens not taking it away
socialism,removed,he said gay he is perpetuating homophobia
socialism,removed,nope merely your level of intelligence looks like i was bang on
socialism,removed,hey its me from a different account i was going to reply but ironically enough the mods banned my other account proving the point in trying to make ideologies to seem nice but who runs them is what matters this is supposed to be a socialist sub that i would assume promoted free speech at no point was i being hateful but i was banned nonetheless good luck with you authoritarian regime disguised as equality its gone terribly astray
socialism,removed,but our shared ideas of whats moral and immoral change over time and it is very important to be able to adapt to it imagine if right now the left leaning government from the was ruling us imagine if years from now the socialists of today were still in charge it wouldnt work
socialism,removed,hillary wasnt always rich neither was obama
socialism,removed,why does the black guy get paid less to be rich than rich people than rich people do with being poor
socialism,removed,yeah a harvard law degree being a professor and a top university then working in government really means youre exploiting the working class
socialism,removed,mlm calling others revisionist
socialism,removed,comrade cringe
socialism,removed,the difference between million a year isnt meaningful in this country
socialism,removed,instead of her being stolen from in the form of a wage she can now steal in the form of revolutionary taxes
socialism,removed,wrong sub op
socialism,removed,honestly i pity you this movement of yours is the last gasp of a dying idiology that has been defeated and prove to be wanting over and over again not a nazi here am a trump supporting capitalist american and i cant help but laugh when a fucking communist talks about a that and several httpyoutubewnyxbjbclc throughout
socialism,removed,autisticliberationnow holy fuck can this sub be even more of a joke how does it feel to be completely inept and unable to connect with normal human beings you perpetually virginal sperg sorry if i triggered you maybe to deal with that you should commit suicide i know youve thought about it maybe even attempted it
socialism,removed,chile in wouldve actually been pretty cool
socialism,removed,im a free speech absolutist so the only thing im against is libel slander and direct threats of violence i disagree when some socialists want to ban certain speech it discredits our belief in freedom and it is used against us to portray us as censorship loving stalin apologists does that mean i agree with what some people say of course not defending the right to x is not therefor defending x so for example i think members of the kkk should be allowed to say what the say without censorship why because then i know that they are terrible people and can stay the hell away from them
socialism,removed,socialist alternative are useful idiots some of their articles are acceptable but their lack of scrutiny and idealization of conflicts just shows their feelingdriven politics more than actual analysis
socialism,removed,so now zimbabwe needs socialism again because the last time it happened it fucked up because the leaders were shit wonderful job guys i hope you guys really feel proud of yourself for the mess you have created socialism should be a dead ideology the fact that you neckbeards want to bring it back is absolute shit go fuck yourselves private property and free markets are the only way out of poverty
socialism,removed,its not a strawperson its literally what someone told me you can pretend that there arent going to be communists mostly those with similar ideologies to yours opposing the people of zimbabwe all you want but they exist
socialism,removed,lol im not making about me you just dont like it when someone points out that you associate yourself with reactionaries who will sooner oppose the working class in favor of their cultish conception of antiimperialism that literally defends people like gaddafi and assad but hey thats what you get when you become a maoist simply because you met some at a barbecue and they seemed like cool people socialism has nothing to do with liberation to you its just a way for you to have friends
socialism,removed,edgy
socialism,removed,just call them twats
socialism,removed,because fostering some attitude of unity between anarchists and people who want to kill anarchists on reddit will build a mass movement
socialism,removed,go back to thedonald

socialism,removed,the japanese nation stands condemned for spurning the truth of the alleged pearl harbor attack which was the impetus for us war against japan thence nuclear attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki in the first place there were at pearl harbor december it was a replay of the incident in havana harbor that precipitated war between the us and spain whereby the us obtained dominion over the philippines there after inflicting unimaginable httpbringthebellsbackorgwhathappenedinbalangiga upon the host population despite the smoke and the sailors shootin the breeze and others just getting on with their business says they were in no way concerned a force of some of enemy aircraft was at large wheeler army air field smoke coming from planes on a row of undamaged aircraft upwind of a conflagration of other burning planes and no blast damage or bomb craters anywhere says they were deliberately set alight at ground level the jew press beat the drums of war in relation to and just like it did post the false flag attacks the earthquake and tsunami of march were caused by while the that devastated the plant was caused by httpwwwhenrymakowcomtheargumentfukushimasabotagehtml that had been placed by an israeli firm under cover of security camera installation under the slogan remember the maine americans went to war with spain eventually winning the philippines and httpwwwwhatreallyhappenedcomwrharticleshawaiihawaiiphp along the way whatreallyhappenedcom
socialism,removed,racism its pretentious and mocking yes but racist people are calling some many things racist now im not sure what the word implies any more
socialism,removed,oh so that means anything to do with norse is now nazi makes sense if you dont think about it at all
socialism,removed,the civil rights movement actually had a goal and its point was justified the blacklivesmatter movement is based on lies and violence their opression lie is just that a lie
socialism,removed,unfortunately a lot of people here like mao so to be fair its only right to have some mao since hes one of the left great mentm
socialism,removed,mao is trash why a statecapitalist peasant nationalist gets to be among actual proletarian revolutionaries is a mystery
socialism,removed,why
socialism,removed,the altright is the same old fascist racist nazi or nazilike right there is no altleft the left is a spectrum of various socialist groups taking on a term like altleft is selfdefeating and just calls up a picture of extremism and exclusivity since its just a corruption of the term altright in my opinion they should just call themselves sjws or whatever else they identify as and not apply a term for themselves that is close to the same term as the various nazilike groups they are only harming themselves by helping people mentally associate them with the evils of the extreme right
socialism,removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikigodwinslaw
socialism,removed,you cant be racist towards white people saltine
socialism,removed,a isis affiliated terrorist drove into truck crashed into a christmas market dead ftfy lets not omit agency when it belongs
socialism,removed,really literally every single tool and every unit of human labor is controlled unilaterally by a small group of capitalists are you folks in this subreddit some strong if there are an average of subscribers for every one active user incapable of organizing perhaps getting a schedule together a manifest of who needs to buy what equipment for the people to own something to do instead of complain if you folks cant do that who can
socialism,removed,well youre not going to do any of the work so
socialism,removed,right i get that its not profitable thats not the argument thats a given but since we know that and you want things done without a profit motive you should do it without a profit motive why dont you
socialism,removed,just as komunisto said work only gets done when capitalists do it socialists arent getting any of the work done no matter what as in youre not going to do any of the work
socialism,removed,its like you need someone to organize the construction and provide you with the tools and equipment and someone to have food ready like a like a businessman perhaps you trade your time and work for a paycheck so you can take care of your family find a way to make this profitable and youve got a great way to provide many people with jobs also known as being a job creator
socialism,removed,you have been temporarily banned from participating in rsocialism this ban will last for days you can still view and subscribe to rsocialism but you wont be able to post or comment note from the moderators no one cares if you downvote every rt link all news is bourgeois news whether its rt or bbc or cbc or cnn and msnbc
socialism,removed,you have been temporarily banned from participating in rsocialism this ban will last for days you can still view and subscribe to rsocialism but you wont be able to post or comment note from the moderators no one cares if you downvote every rt link all news is bourgeois news whether its rt or bbc or cbc or cnn and msnbc
socialism,removed,its also difficult to take someone seriously when they cant pronounce basic word and place names
socialism,removed,hello this comment was automatically removed for violating our policy on ableist language your comment will be reinstated when the word mron is removed from your post to help the sub become more inclusive to disabled people we ask that you refrain from using language that makes a point by comparing someone to a person with intellectual or physical disabilities in a negative way is a list of ableist language and a helpful list of alternatives you can use as a resource
socialism,removed,theres nothing inherently wrong with talking about normalcy if i was talking about the mentally ill in a condescending or mean way then yeah
socialism,removed,triggered libsocs
socialism,removed,so the sub reddit is censoring posts of stuff they dont agree with thats very fascists and socialist of u guys
socialism,removed,no i see the overwhelming complaints
socialism,removed,how can the workers control the economic means and who decides who gets what if youre good at bussiness shouldnt you get more than others if youre a good musician shouldnt you be rewarded if not then what are you striving for in life the ussr was communist but socialism is just a step before communism capitalism is every worker is free to do whatever they want in no way was the ussr capitalistic thats just plain foolish
socialism,removed,haha i hope not but thanks im hoping that the mods take the opportunity to engage on this level as i havent seen anything justifying their actions philosophically just yet
socialism,removed,honestly this sub has hit a new low when it comes to rules and enforcing them especially the ableist rules if i will simply be honest we need a serious change of leadership and mods this has gone far enough
socialism,removed,i wonder if he has the courtesy to use a tic tac first
socialism,removed,yeah i said that my dude it just didnt do it fully
socialism,removed,yeah as degrading as this is these are still white collar workers this is minor compared to the soul draining conditions of sweatshop workers but this will generate more outrage from the netizens because they are white collar workers just reading the description of the shanghaiist website is nauseating its geared towards the young affluent urbanites ie yuppies
socialism,removed,but did they have tictacs
socialism,removed,no it isnt green party can you finally get your head out of your ass youre being a global scale embarrassment for the leftist movement
socialism,removed,its not the root of all problems its a part of the larger reality also even in early descriptions of communism it was always said first you needed to go through an era of capitalism moving away from fantasy we can go into the reality which is that modern capitalism isnt necessarily a bad thing since it drives individuals and innovations that doesnt mean that governments shouldnt drive to be as socialistic and democratic as possible but the economy is fine without a takeover of manufacturing equipment mostly this can be attributed to the rapid growth that science gives us and even the worst economies cant handicap the increase in quality of life that science provides us so tldr science is so good that even the shittiest of economic systems cant hold us back
socialism,removed,he literally talk like a male jill stein
socialism,removed,they still have a huge role with the public and legal powers even if they arent exercised completely freely that overstates the extent of their power if they were to ever unbalance the status quo by actually working against parliament theyd be abolished in an instant
socialism,removed,i was just thinking about this today so theyre socialists but wont touch the socialism brand only gringos would do such a thing smh
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,but muh national liberation
socialism,removed,i love seeing niggers killed for being violent play stupid games win stupid prizes
socialism,removed,why would you get active with a hate group
socialism,removed,go unnecessary violence the solution to all problems
socialism,removed,yeah how dare he try to work with people one on one instead of with a mob
socialism,removed,agreed there but you simply cant reason with a mob think of a union where they elect representatives or the usa for that matter we cant all just say we want x at once we have to have an ability to work in manageable chunks on anything
socialism,removed,no no youre right the one person definitely ought negotiate with an entire mob at once
socialism,removed,you can still fundamentally make a huge rift through mass protest alone theres no need to use violence take the high road which they dont
socialism,removed,blm seems to becoming a breeding ground for racism horrible to see considering its noble cause
socialism,removed,thats all well and good how do you justify the disgusting racism towards whites displayed in milwaukee over the past few days blm seems to becoming a breeding ground for racism horrible to see considering its noble cause
socialism,removed,take a look at all the racist attacks against white people the past few days it aint a coincidence
socialism,removed,cuck
socialism,removed,but but muh oppresion
socialism,removed,is every retards name here a carl marx pun
socialism,removed,if you socialists cared about your improving yourself or career as much as you care about the wage gap you could join the proletariat get a real job bum ass niggas
socialism,removed,i posted a link earlier today about a conference comming up in detroit that is being hosted by the socialist equality party i think this is a good step in building a legitimate socialist party in the us if youre interested in getting more involved and taking action you should take a look into the sep the post daily articles at httpwwwwswsorg hope you find this interesting
socialism,removed,oh of course not im just saying it would be cool if we had a system in place for that but you know murica
socialism,removed,the bourgeoisie use drugs too mostly for pleasure and lets not forget that the workers under communism would be working work creates stress angst etc no matter what system there will be people doing drugs people developing addictions and people needing help overcoming them communism wouldnt have welfare in the sense that we do now but only because it would be concerned with the welfarewellbeing of its populace it would help people find jobs it would help people live better lives in general
socialism,removed,go left young tankies theres no way mlm doesnt go horribly wrong especially in stl
socialism,removed,this is insane
socialism,removed,how can we connect to these privileged liberals and capitalists dont connect with the enemy an extremely small amount will become class traitors and join the communist causestruggle try to understand and always remember this they are part of the expropriating population theres no grand conspiratorial false consciousness their interests are in preserving the exploitative oppressive status quo because they are in fact net beneficiaries under this system
socialism,removed,they are part of the expropriating population theres no grand conspiratorial false consciousness their interests are in preserving the exploitative oppressive status quo because they are in fact net beneficiaries under this system they are enemies
socialism,removed,i was booted from the server just because i was a white man well ill just join the fascists then they have better infographics heil hitler and goodbye
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,we didnt ban leftcoms if you notice leftcoms make up a good portion of out mod team and may be the most represented tendency within it what you are glossing over is the months of harassment we received at the hands of a small group of leftcoms leftcoms are not banned but people from specific subreddits are
socialism,removed,apparently the moderators are so trigger happy to ban here that they banned for asserting that they were banning dissent so they banned the dissenter on this thread for objecting to their bans heres a link
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,whine harder
socialism,removed,think hed rather starve to death without work is a hundred million dead from socialism in a single century ethical
socialism,removed,what does buy him though and i doubt hes handed a american bill tell me what kind of life he is living his quality of life for him and his family dont talk to me about the money hes making
socialism,removed,probably cause his poor work ethic with that sittin on the job attitude
socialism,removed,tell me what kind of life for him and his family
socialism,removed,i lold too hard
socialism,removed,there are no alternatives for people other than to work in turmoil or face the consequences of the natural order we cant all be a bunch of lazy bums some of us have to work
socialism,removed,i never implied socialism equals death or capitalism equals death it seems youre the one lacking comprehension
socialism,removed,its not fantasy add the deaths from rebellions in china the soviets sa cuba and etc add the dead who died of starvation due to horribly mismanaged systems of distribution and those who were culled by the implemented fascist communist dictators and you get million easily
socialism,removed,yeah thats the wishful thinking of low powerinfluence plebeians failures at life want successful people to give them free shit that they dont have to work for fine they can daydream as they will but when you rile up the low productivity lechers of society to attack the highly productive you surely must understand that results in dire consequences all of recent history is very clear proof of this
socialism,removed,mass starvation stemming from absolute shit tier economic models and centralized planning isnt some accidental accidental disaster like you think it is
socialism,removed,well
socialism,removed,some people enjoy sex with random people or being watched or being dominant in a whips and chains way in a perfect economy those people should be allowed to profit what ever that means in said economy from that forcing them to do it for survival is what the inherent evil of capitalism there is nothing wrong with sex
socialism,removed,i entirely agree but i suspect this might come down to whether or not you think things can be exchanged without commodifying them
socialism,removed,sexist
socialism,removed,the sucecss of capitalism obviously
socialism,removed,im a egalitarian
socialism,removed,how are women being oppressed
socialism,removed,how does it not represent those issues you pointed out
socialism,removed,how would science flourish capitalism allows scientists almost unbounded room to experiment if mutual aid was the law of the land everg experiment that was deemed not in the interest of mutual aid would get scrapped before scientists even had the chance to discover anything regulation is a disaster for scientific discovery
socialism,removed,its not wasted time there is no such thing as a nonsensical field you dont have moral superiority over everybody else you dont get to decide what is nonsensical and neither does the government if people want to research it they should be allowed to even if it doesnt pass your arbitrary requirements for being useful research government sponsored science would be bogged down by beaurocracy and lack of competition which would result in mutual aid being a disaster
socialism,removed,por que
socialism,removed,they research what people pay them to research therefore the research is funded by private interests whether the scientist is the one deciding the reasearch is irrelevant
socialism,removed,people decide what is good by buying what they want it is unbounded room by allowing any experiment to be done not just those experiments that are deemed to be adding to the cause of the common good you are being pedantic by saying that scientists dont have unbounded room because they have to apply for grants ans work for other people and refusing to recognize that the people who fund the experimenta have unbounded room it doesnt matter whether the scientists are doing what they want in the same way that it doesnt matter whether or not an employee wants to do a specific task the people who fund research decide thus in the end somebody is determining what to research without being tied down to vague and foolish notions of the common good
socialism,removed,no not all of it is plenty of research occura at universities but in general profit is the motive does it really matter what the motive is would you care if the cure for cancer was discovered by some faceless corporation who only wanted to make money or would you suck it up and be happy thag a cure was found at all
socialism,removed,you wouldnt have an iphone if people werent allowed to develop it on their own are you seriously suggesting that apple shouldnt be allowed to make new versions of the iphone because we dont need it thats why i brought up what people but they decide for themselves if they need it the government shouldnt be able to say you dont need that so they cant make it
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,it is deliberately attempting to divert the natural course of innovation people make what people sell people sell what people buy people buy what people want if the government tried go control this process in any way the result would be an authoritative government dictating to people what they should be doing most people do not want to told what they need and what they should buy this is what you are advocating for bar nothing
socialism,removed,soyoure going to wage war to do some damage to a several million dollar piece of equipment to hurt the economy you say youve thought about thisbut it sounds like youve only fantasized i dont plan on solving or abolishing capitalism helping workers isnt a means to end capitalism helping workers is the end in of itself much like it seems your end result is to wage war no matter the idiology that gives you the okay if you really cared as much as you say literally no one is stopping you bombs are easy to make and bullets all the cheaper so go out and wage your war and see how the workers you dont really care about embrace you
socialism,removed,was it that or your inability to do better in life
socialism,removed,nazis were socialists you fucktards
socialism,removed,i really hate that fucking guy
socialism,removed,proof
socialism,removed,wow way to be a little snitch
socialism,removed,can we stop stickying these posts and sticky my posts about how nocountry is a fascist for removing my posts about arnold palmers and pol pot
socialism,removed,is this your only response when you know i can statistically prove you wrong
socialism,removed,lol wrong person and its a joke leave the kids alone they dont deserve their lives ruined for a joke
socialism,removed,i wouldnt call this bashing the fash when it sounds like he was laid out on his ass by a skinhead
socialism,removed,proof or its fake news
socialism,removed,both flint and pittsburgh have government run water treatment but sure its the fault of privatization give me a break
socialism,removed,so that twat who punched another twat on tv was fascists
socialism,removed,amazing you decided which political tribe i am supposed to subscribed to just on the basis of one question which i asked are you a wizard
socialism,removed,post a pic of your injuries or this is just shit stirring garbage two broken ribs posting hours later ive been to an american we and this seems unlikely
socialism,removed,racial and gender issues are idealist nonsense they are not based on materialism unless youre a racerealist or someone who thinks women are genetically inferior to men there is literally no materialism in those issues that class struggle cannot answer
socialism,removed,my only gripe with this though is that liberalism fought and won two world wars granted the soviets also fought wwii but without liberalist democracies they may not have been able to hold off the fascists just my thought id be willing to hear what you all have to say though
socialism,removed,i always disagree with violence as a socialist but keep in mind this is the same sub that regularly calls for violence against other groups
socialism,removed,did you tell him that nazi is an abbreviation of national socialism
socialism,removed,yea like when those racists blacks tourtred a mentally handicapped white child
socialism,removed,you shouldnt play identity politics its the game of narrow minded fools were all equal citizens
socialism,removed,the only way to talk to a leftist is lead and gas
socialism,removed,this is good news but id much rather the fascists be dead though
socialism,removed,next up is the festering shit hole of td

socialism,removed,fuck yes next up rthedonald you nazi fucks have been put on blast please keep brigading keep trolling see where it gets you with based spez
socialism,removed,now can we ban this sub
socialism,removed,instead of using reddit these worthless fucks should just off themselves anyways rfuckyoualtrightcunts
socialism,removed,as much as i love to see this hate get banned this could become a slippery slope for free speech on reddit
socialism,removed,comrades jesus christ
socialism,removed,as someone who cares about free speech and an open exchange of ideas im sad to hear that id much rather fight bad ideas with the ideas than try to fight them with censorship or violence
socialism,removed,ive never looked at raltright but why the joy in silencing free speech reddit has changed for the worse in the last few years voat is still in its infancy but will grow as reddit becomes an echo chamber for a small group too bad i guess all good things come to an end
socialism,removed,military the only federal entity unaffected by trumps halting of hiring wow he doesnt even have to do anything anymore to trigger you people
socialism,removed,one can never be too careful i agree it was dumb on my part to keep it for that long and to contribute to local subs in general
socialism,removed,well neither i hate the altright id just much rather have an open and honest discussion refusing to have the conversation with people who disagree with us will make us look like our arguments arent sufficient against theirs furthermore forcing them into an even more isolated echochamper will make sure that theyre never presented with new ideas or perspectives this will cause them to become more extreme
socialism,removed,alt right retire btch
socialism,removed,years
socialism,removed,next stop rthedonald
socialism,removed,so lame that they got banned everywhere for trying to brigade other leftleaning subs
socialism,removed,how is this related in any way to socialism because of national socialism i dont get it
socialism,removed,its because when you act violently and police or other order forces stop you you start crying police brutality and violation of human rights
socialism,removed,this might be the stupidest thing ive read today
socialism,removed,so much hate and death inspired by those combined symbols symbols of oppression and greed i feel truly sorry for you
socialism,removed,hes right you cant restore something that never went away in the first place
socialism,removed,im talking about fb uber a lot of social media most people take for granted social media has the power to change the world for the better but even then the people in charge cannot have so much power
socialism,removed,what
socialism,removed,twitter was used by democratic protesters like those in the arab world
socialism,removed,to refer to those with lesser intelligence than others always doing so in a demeaning way yeah its an insult used to demean someone for saying something idiotic its not an attack on people who arent able to speak i dont even think the majority of people know the history of the word it is used to oppress those who are differently abled just as a word like btch is used to oppress women and the nword is used to oppress black people plenty of people say btch and ngga without being oppressive the former word is used without a gendered connotation and the latter has been reclaimed by some black folks the fact that btch is practically no longer used to describe a female dog and is used to describe both men and women is a positive sign that the word is losing the edge it once had and yes the word isnt always used to directly reference someone that are differently abled now a days but this just signals a normalization of the word and therefore its oppressive nature in our society if normalizing a word means it slowly drifts away from its oppressive origins and takes on unrelated or different meanings i dont see the problem with that languages are littered with formerly offensive terms and the fact that the meaning behind words can be disposed of with new meanings is good
socialism,removed,antifa are so hilariously hypocritical and unaware of their cognitive dissonance wonder when antifa will start supporting the gassing of fascists
socialism,removed,supremacists and racists cant come up with anything better than ignorant name calling
socialism,removed,the single mom was just arrested exactly like the tv personalities she didnt get any jail time either
socialism,removed,socialism doesnt work and never has
socialism,removed,we can simply create an socioeconomic bill of rights
socialism,removed,i think youre mad at the corrupt nature of the industries and the environment that fosters them change the culture and redo the rules so that justice can be better enforced
socialism,removed,social media is a doubleedged sword but in the end we need it its better to enforce a stronger set of socioeconomic rights so that corporations can be made to bow down from their greedy corruption dont make new rules make new rights
socialism,removed,the government just as the current bill of rights is enforced by the government now before you get skeptical yes there will be times when the government will betray those values but having a bill of rights at least prevents the government from doing much worse
socialism,removed,the single mom also did not get jail time the system works by arresting anyone suspected of a crime and then deciding if they actually committed it this will not change in a socialist society and will probably be worse because of bigger government while sad a gross misjustice and cruel to the mother it is something that will not change in a socialist society this is just officers being overaggressive for no reason whatsoever
socialism,removed,im not sure why but for some reason nobody seems to want to read the article they face several charges including child abuse and substance abuse and lost their jobs there is no injustice here other than a narrative being pushed by op
socialism,removed,how will socialism fix the problem it is evident in this post that government isnt the solution but in fact government appears to be the problem
socialism,removed,i agree she shouldve never neglected her kids
socialism,removed,depends on where and who besides we need a socioeconomic bill of rights its time is overdue and no matter what it needs to be pushed for
socialism,removed,im more mad at crony capitalism than capitalism in general social democracy is a form of capitalism in a happy marriage with socialism and im not sure if revolution is the right word these techs companies were already revolutionary to a degree
socialism,removed,oh look everyone can cry racism rather than looking at all the facts perfect reddit post
socialism,removed,but nice try pushing your fabricated narrative
socialism,removed,white couple lost their jobs and were convicted of abuse and placed on probation but no jail black lady had all the charges against her dropped the outrage
socialism,removed,what is the double standard here the white couple was arrested charged convicted and placed on probationbut no jail the black lady was arrested but the charges were dropped so please explain the despicable double standard
socialism,removed,you dont think leaving a year old and a year old alone in the mall for minutes where you cannot see them and they cannot see you warrants an arrest
socialism,removed,being logical isnt allowed in this sub
socialism,removed,what was the double standard exactly both were arrested and neither faced jailtime
socialism,removed,what is the double standard here the white couple was arrested charged convicted and placed on probationbut no jail the black lady was arrested but the charges were dropped so please explain the despicable double standard
socialism,removed,wait siy is banned
socialism,removed,oh hi
socialism,removed,hi can we not use child abuse to spread socialism it hurts our cause thanks
socialism,removed,if anyone wants to read about history repeating itself look into how the left failed to stop hitlers rise to power in germany
socialism,removed,out of curiosity how old are you or a range that you are comfortable with sharing changing my daily language to not use retd is something i have to constantly remind myself for the same reasons that were stated its not toward any of the differently abled but meant to describe outlandish ideas
socialism,removed,i dont understand what needs to be done here its not like women are incapable of joining this subreddit when they wish to all this shows to me is there are more men interested in this subreddit than women why is that wrong men and women are freely choosing to join or not join the sub why do we need to make sure that there is almost exactly of a proportion between the genders how is this any more relevant than making sure that there is enough red haired people or blue eyed people in the sub why not just invite people to join the discussion if they wish why is this sort of micromanagement necessary how will this improve the discussion in the sub how will this improve the state of anything here
socialism,removed,when your feels about your vocabulary are more important than their dehumanizing effects on others fuck off seriously have your opinion if you must be a shithead but this isnt the place to make excuses
socialism,removed,youre being so vague theres no conversation to be had go ahead list the words you think you have the right to use and are harmless
socialism,removed,id like to share my opinion if thats okay i think that people need to remember they have a public and private vocabulary with different words being acceptable in both i agree that the ableist or sexist words that have become ingrained in our vocabulary hurt people but wouldnt it be okay if we just agree not to use those words publicly like in this forum but dont call people evil not if they use them privately i think this is a good compromise because it prevents the accidental bullying that op said talked about while preserving personal freedom of speech trying to make people change their culture is only going to make them negative towards the cause but i think most people would be willing to talk about removing some words from their public vocabulary if you dont infringe upon their private vocabulary i know ill be countered with the freeze peach meme but its a fact of life that people are going to hate you if you demand they change their lives without offering compromisez
socialism,removed,i thank you very much for sharing your story with us i understand it must be difficult to open up to a forum of perfect strangers like this even with the veil of internet anonymity however in truth stupid is an incredibly common word that can be used to describe a very wide range of things in truth i think that you should learn resilience and most importantly learn that you are not any less of a person because of something that you happened to be born with people are assholes people rape people murder and people discriminate against others for things out of their control and anyone who thinks that physical disability intellectual disability is the stupid one on another note i think that people are far to obsessed with words rather than their context you can say terrible things to someone without uttering any word that comes close to impolite on its own and you can use all manner of profanities and slurs as terms of endearment this obsession that society has with words as they are written in the dictionary as opposed to their intent is something we need to get past
socialism,removed,this is why you need a materialist perspective folks riamverysmart
socialism,removed,socialism is not and has never been a host of saints socialism had nothing to do with morality
socialism,removed,you mods do as you please anyway so much for democracy
socialism,removed,i think that the policing of this sub has gotten too overbearing and that many people feel they are walking on eggshells without being able to express it thats not even necessarily in reference to the new policies but just the overuse of banning in general if the sub continues down this path a lot of good comrades are going to be alienated again not in reference to banning ableist speech in the rules
socialism,removed,here is the problem with that today to describe people with low iq we use the term intellectual disability however a long time ago we would say imbecile and idiot to describe them but that got too offensive so we used mental retardation to describe it but that got too offensive so we used intellectual disability now the word disability is becoming offesive to people the problem isnt to words its the usage you can say retarded and not be offensive its possible i just did it you can make new words but if you do you will do it every years forever a simpler solution is to go people are assholes and no matter what you say someone will try to be offensive with it and just deal with the problem if a panel on your car is rusting out you need to replace not just put some paint over it
socialism,removed,came across this today and thought it might interest some here note how insidious liberal ideology is in a religion that claims to follow jesus christ who arguably is presented in the gospels as devoted to working class interests we have gems like this striking he said was not the way to settle a problem we were expected to be responsible citizens and if we had a complaint we could come to the principals office and discuss it i learned that if you wanted to see ahead as you were going down the road you had to keep the engine running at a fast clip so just as id discovered it is with our lives industry enthusiasm and hard work lead to enlightened progress you have to stay on your feet and keep moving if you are going to have light in your life my heart aches and i grieve when i see the tragedy of so many broken homes of homes where husbands do not seem to know how to treat their wives of homes where children are abused and grow to become the abusers of another generation none of this tragedy is necessary i know it is not the answer to our problems lies in following the simple gospel of jesus christ the son of god who brought into the world his fathers love i carried with me for decades the story of how evil it was that people should strike instead of going to a person in authority begging for scraps and accepting what was given it was part of my psyche for years so that in spite of having a parent in a union i was opposed to unions i grew up working class but was convinced that conservatives and ancraps had the answers to these issues and that anyone poorer than me didnt work hard all very much reinforced by a religious institution that one might expect to have more the opposite influence
socialism,removed,nice username comrade
socialism,removed,as someone with a serious mental illness i really have to disagree i hate when people measure words as if im so fragile that the truth will kill me meh whatever honestly theres no winning we ban these words then people will just develop new ways of saying something someone has said is bad or that theyre not thinking about things properly and of course those words will have some form of connection or link to something that makes someone feel bad and well get rid of those too and the whole revolution will involve nothing more than us inventing ever more absurd ways to describe how retarded were being and nigger please im officially developmentally retarded so i can use that word all the fuck i want and yeh i am still smarted than most of you because youre all lazy fucks true story
socialism,removed,well comrade i was raised in it does that mean i had no hope of coming to socialism so ignore and leave it alone this is representative of the type of people we need to reach we need to find ways to fight this rhetoric and its not easy as i say in an above comment i should have been more socialist or at least leftleaning than i was i grew up very blue collar in a family with generations of blue collar people my neighborhood was heavily working class but most people i knew bought into some form of ideology like this its part of what has broken the spirit of the workers movement in the us this ideology is hard to fight in particular because of how its presented the speech isnt pure vitriol or hate there are elements in there which are good mixed with things that cut people off at the knees if they believe it i think we need to see how institutions like many churches schools news charities universities etc have turned people from class consciousness
socialism,removed,noplatforming opposing ideas is just as bad just because you dont agree with someones ideas doesnt mean that they dont have a right to be heard not allowing them to be heard will help legitimize fascist ideology if you want your platform heard dont try to silence dissent have open discourse debates etc if the people in whatever platform one believes in cant handle having their reasoning put under scrutiny it wont stand the course of time the whole idea of forcing left or right ideas isnt going to accomplish anything forcing ideologies and ideas on people is what got trump into office in the first place
socialism,removed,im in agreement here i come down more on the side of challenging people directly rather than banning them or censoring their posts doing this pisses people off and no one likes to be censored another thing is that words really do vary from person to person words do not make me hurt or feel sensitive despite the fact that im mentally ill have had insults hurled at me and so on i dont feel offended by the use of crazy etc now if im in conversation and i say that word and someone asks me to stop in front of them then i will i can still sympathize and alter my speech for their sakes with that said im not going to alter my entire speech pattern and word choices otherwise fact of the matter is that it is every day speech and until there is some catalytist to remove these words from every day speech theyre going to be there and word policing is only going to subject us to the pcu kind of mocking
socialism,removed,i dont condone hatred or violence you have no idea where i nor my friends stand in the lgbt community nor do you know my sex or religion nobody speaks for an entire community especially those that i was involved in life doesnt work that way i dont want to create a white ethnostate in america nor anywhere else i dont want to peacefully deport anyone thats not my business in order to vigorously oppose my ideas youd have to know a what my ideas are by b buying comic books and prints i keep my hands to myself youre in a position of power on reddit all ive done is offered open discourse i havent attacked anyones politics or used my position to threaten people specifically other reddit users with dissenting opinions by saying that theyll regret actions that they had no actual part of quite frankly i think its fair to say that such actions are unfair
socialism,removed,i hope you guys realize that hitler and the nazi party practiced fiscal socialism
socialism,removed,if by middle class he means proletarians as opposed to lumpenproletarians than yes
socialism,removed,police pose as panhandlers to issue seatbelt violations
socialism,removed,test
socialism,removed,right because centralized planning of all aspects of life are always the most efficient and effective ways to provide for the populace just look at how great our prison systems allocate cell space to the general populace at a rate faster and greater than any other country in the world comrades
socialism,removed,because that is marxist theory marx called the underclass counterrevolutionary its only the people who are actually producing actually holding up society that are the revolutionaries in the modern usa where of people dont work that could be called middle class by some perspectives
socialism,removed,haha tom looked like he was really suffering sitting there with bill lecturing him about how we already have socialism bernie is king of socialists and capitalism is great you can just see he wants to start quoting marx or bakunin at him
socialism,removed,maher gives his main guest a good minutes to talk his show does not produce soundbites and does not care at all about ratings bill just does whatever he feel like doing and answers to nobody
socialism,removed,yea that really does bother me he rants about how great socialism is every single show and he has even a casual socialist like morello on and is completely clueless as to what hes talking about
socialism,removed,he seemed pretty dejected after his big speech about how hes not able to opt out of capitalism went over everyones heads
socialism,removed,i read every political sub socialists are useful for their critique of capitalism just gotta ignore all the degeneracy
socialism,removed,no i am a nazi
socialism,removed,socialism will never work in america the country was built on capitalistic ideals and is deeply ingrained in the culture
socialism,removed,wait what huh the taxi unions have been trying to shut down uber et al because theyve been bypassing the cartel that is unionized taxis in new york decades of research shows that unionizing raises costs and slows efficiency so uber drivers are sacrificing the very things that make them a viable alternative to taxis people can be so damned dumb
socialism,removed,yes but it was choice to make it if wasnt then thats different the view that held is is the brain is the connection to this world once a connections is established it to late to be removed its a duty to continue bore that its just an organism
socialism,removed,publishing working class media what do you guys think of trumps working class constituency
socialism,removed,the rsocialist community im an outsider but i ask in genuine good faith what you guys think about how trump has tapped into the antiestablishment antiglobalist largely scottirish working class
socialism,removed,boohoo property
socialism,removed,abortions from rape account for about of total abortions
socialism,removed,this is garbage islam isnt a race or a marker for race its not racism islam is an ideology and im not islamophobic for saying so islam is a religion based on accounts of the sayings of a prophet and the scriptures he recited thats the unifying factor doctrine we dont need to call islamophobia racism because its not racism
socialism,removed,why are you even in this subreddit
socialism,removed,is there a gonzalo flair
socialism,removed,well that sounds like abundantly convincing rhetoric for swaying the jobless working class from trump
socialism,removed,so whom do you guys advocate for if you have scorn for the working class
socialism,removed,yes it is you are asked if he supported abortion in the case of rape when we arent even talking about rape which is an illogical fallacy
socialism,removed,i am antiabortion the fetus is a developing human and has the right to life in of all abortions the fetus is aborted simply because of its incovienience so you guys can talk about rape and medical emergencies all you want that just simply has zero to do with current abortion trends
socialism,removed,what a stupid fucking argument hitler thought all the jews were legitimately doing wrong so murdering them wasnt anti semitism it was justice
socialism,removed,ad hom i said developing by the way removing a month old fetus from the womb is one of the most vile acts man can do
socialism,removed,thats surprising liberals usually side with the fash after things like this regardless you need to go into the homes of neonazis drag them out into the street and execute them like the dangerous filth they are i mean showing up to a demo is nice its not what we need but its nice maybe it will lead up to that
socialism,removed,coops can be a great way to start but i truly believe they are only the beginning of a wider movement like in france theres a lot of union movement currently but very little means of production being seized
socialism,removed,you are a beacon of intelligence
socialism,removed,if you can stop being such a hateful ass for seconds i would like your honest opinion what are your immediate thoughts when you see a pregnant woman smoking drinking or involved in drugs
socialism,removed,finland doesnt exist
socialism,removed,because hitler wasnt a socialist
socialism,removed,speaking from a peruvians own account of el sendero luminoso shining path i can say that it was a terrorist organization which destroyed many families no it wasnt a group that fought for indigenous people it was a group that annihilated them although the shining path began with arguably good intentions sparked by indigenous thinkers who were influenced by marxism taught in the universities it deteriorated into an undeniably vile bloodbath and now exists merely as a drug peddling shit organization if you read primary accounts or retellings of the groups history and actions it is quite clear to see that they were despicablecarrying out its revolution by indiscriminate murder of all people women and children rich or dirt poor how fucked up of you to ask for a flair of its leaders think again please
socialism,removed,eh dont quote me on this but what i know is that the deal is that they surrender their arms and can start being a legal political party ujusticeowl
socialism,removed,this is a strong propaganda coup against the fascists nevertheless understand that the nordic resistance movement and movements like it across europe exist only as a natural protest to the migrant policies of merkel and the german government simply put as long as the crisis continues to escalate million people estimated at the doors of europe nothing will prevent these movements from expanding you want to stop them then the left has to oppose this kind of mass immigration which it will probably not do out of ideology
socialism,removed,but you plan to crush the only resistance to islamists in the west you will not be able to deal with islamists they will rape you and play with your corpse
socialism,removed,nobody is forcing anybody people need to take responsibility for their actions
socialism,removed,fetus has a heartbeat at weeks that isnt a corpse science be damned muh body muh right
socialism,removed,ah rsubredditcancer ironically one of the most cancerous subreddits along with rfatpeoplehate and rshitredditsays
socialism,removed,abortion because of rape vs consensual pregnancy are two entirely different arguments get your head out of your ass you brought rape into the convo
socialism,removed,yeah but its lip service and compromise bernie got the ball rolling in the right direction but will it even matter in the long run maybe when all the baby boomers do us a favor and die off
socialism,removed,i dont need a kidney and nobody is forcing me to give mine up so lets stop with the fallacious reasoning for one second nobody is debating the right to save a womans life death rate due to child birth is extremely low and is not the overriding reasoning for women to have abortions as the large majority are performed in the first trimester when there is no danger to womans health how do you respond when you see a pregnant woman smoking drinking using drugs
socialism,removed,dont quote me on this but stalin did nothing wrong s ulupyr
socialism,removed,how does this differ from the way nazis treated socialists and communists in interwar germany no one has the right to assault someone in the name of ideology

socialism,removed,boris was right all along where are the water cannons theresa
socialism,removed,just another example of the antiimperialist socialist ypg darlings of the western left terrorizing and committing genocide against arabs and all nonkurds maybe if america sends more special forces and bombs to them it will increase their class struggle power level
socialism,removed,has the capitalist enthusiast group known as the ypg celebrated their successful attack yet maybe they can open up another airbase for america or tweet out some more memes feature kyooooooot idf kurd girls
socialism,removed,yeah lol you got me i was just trolling i actually think helping imperialists build air bases and massacre civilians is cool and good im just pretending to be critical bc im actually a western leftist biji serok apo biji obama imwithher ◠‿◠✿
socialism,removed,the ypg were the ones who called in the air strike there are us special forces wearing ypg and ypj lol patches the goal of the kurdish nationalists is to have their own state at any cost including being the next israel lets not forget the kibbutzim were originally seen as socialist and egalitarian organizations where antiimperialists and socialists should put their support is clear
socialism,removed,socialists and antiimperialists everywhere are noticing only western leftists who are more interested in tweeting out pictures of photogenic kurd girls than examining the actual material conditions are cheering the sdf
socialism,removed,i have nothing against kurds or any other ethnic group i do have a problem with being willing lackeys of imperialist forces to pursue your own selfish interests and i have a problem with the blatant hypocrisy of selfproclaimed socialists who will cheer on any malignant force as long as it has a veneer of progressivism and doesnt negatively affect their standard of living who cares about the people suffering from the bombing right and there is obviously so much propaganda value in posting to a small and irrelevant clickbait website viewed by a selfselected group of people with zero political power thats why the kremlin assad uh hugo chavezs ghost sent me here finally if you scroll upwards on this page you will see one of us making excuses for this war crime it is clear who between the two of us the principled antiimperialist is
socialism,removed,if you have nothing against antiimperialism then why do you say that being armed and funded by america and then massacring dozens of civilians and children from the sky a pattern that has repeated itself for many decades now not terrorism by any definition indeed nothing i have said is a lie all the atrocities committed by the imperialist kurdish nationalists and their western sponsors are welldocumented i know that taking a principled stand against groups who have undergone a pricey pr campaign orchestrated by the finest washington lobbyists will result in many downvotes from social fascists i welcome your hatred aside i wonder if the pr firms hired to burnish the ypgs image could have foreseen the success of their campaign they were probably targeting middle americans who turn on minutes of news a night but they have completely colonized the minds of even soidisant socialists hefty bonuses for all involved im sure im heartened to see you explicitly admit your approval of us foreign policy as an old comrade once said we should support whatever the enemy opposes and oppose whatever the enemy supports it is clear now who our enemies are and whom they support
socialism,removed,who is he but heh this needs to be a soundbyte xd
socialism,removed,what is your solution
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,httpsyoutubegcpaszqpxje
socialism,removed,i really dont see a single proposal youve done nothing but make vague statements with no real depth behind them take your claim on medicine for example specifically the part about technology advancing so rapidly why do you think this is because of the free market because of capitalism you single handedly contradicted your entire argument in that one small segment people think socialismcommunism is the work of the devil it has a history of failures and the only arguments i see from socialistscommunists is that its not real socialism when it is actually exactly socialism by the very definition of what socialism and capitalism actually is this picture unironically perfectly illustrates what i mean socialism and communism are failed ideologies and will always be considered as such you can blame what you want but the data is there
socialism,removed,not have someone with more practical ideas answer you hahaha this is a socialist sub reddit and youre talking to me about practical ideas what actually exactly socialism by the very definition is actual definition a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production distribution and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole marxist socialism in marxist theory socialism also called lowerstage communism or the socialist mode of production refers to a specific historical phase of economic development and its corresponding set of social relations that supersede capitalism in the schema of historical materialism yes are they because of the capitalist economy i dont believe so doesnt matter what you believe point is we have clear comparisons of the two with capitalism clearly coming out as the more successful means of economical structure the only argument i see from socialists is well that wasnt real socialism and that to me is simply a cop out its a shitty structure that typical hippies follow because it allows them to engage in their inner cynicism and dude fuck the government im being so productive and deluding myself into thinking i actually stand for a cause history is all the evidence i need socialism is and forever will be known as a laughable failure
socialism,removed,what you have going on here is psychopaths trying to squeeze more from the common man and their enablers who are eager to gobble up some table scraps
socialism,removed,i dont blame the workers as much as i do the short sightedness of many unions i dont know bout this one if u r going to operate under a capitalist economy then u have to confront cronyism head onwhich means many things including going after those who benefit from loss of such jobs and be long range thinkers and solutions oriented not just reacting two u have to have workers develop entrepreneurial skill so they can move up the capitalist ladder there r only a handful of unions that r really socialist n they r mostly in theory only if that
socialism,removed,well thats what fucking happens isnt it
socialism,removed,there is no right side of history you either do good things or you dont dont think calling people comrade on the internet makes you a hero

socialism,removed,im a socialist i voted for bernie in ca and will be definitely voting for trump in november if you dont understand how killarys no fly zone in syria will escalate into youre both an idiot and brain damaged if you want to prevent you have to vote for trump to prevent clinton from winning the nomination i wonder why trump is a fascist for saying mean things about muslims and hispanics but killary who slaughtered hundreds of thousands of muslims and hispanics through violent regime change in libya honduras and syria for some reason isnt i guess insulting minorities is a lot more offensive to first world liberals than massacring hundreds of thousands of them
socialism,removed,sorry but the word fascist has an actual definition its not a synonym for bad or evil there is nothing fascist about trump in reality hes a leftwing nationalist if you actually listen to his speeches instead of the talking heads on cnn youd realize the majority of his message is about scrapping free trade deals like nafta and putting an end to neoliberal deindustrialization bringing jobs and wealth back to the country maybe you dont realize it but millions of working class americans had their lives totally destroyed by nafta and neoliberalism trump is the only politician to criticize this policy which is the main reason he has so much support amongst the working class its easy to shit on the dumbfuck rednecks who support trump when you never had a job that was suddenly shipped overseas leaving you and your family destitute its easy to call trump a fascist and his supporters racist for wanting to build a wall when youre a petty bourgeois college liberal whos never had to compete with lowwage undocumented immigrants to make a living and feed your family if instead of realizing why so many working class people support trump you just continue to sling vapid insults at him and his supporters you accomplish nothing but further alienating the left from the working class not to mention bringing about and human extinction
socialism,removed,funny you bring up privilege you were watching game of thrones on your hdtv while killary illegally backed terrorists to overthrow the libyan government killing you were hitting the bong with your buds while she staged coups against the elected governments of honduras and ukraine killing thousands you were drinking mochas at starbucks while she spearheaded illegal violent regime change against the elected syrian government unleashing isis and slaughtering hundreds of thousands of people i wish youd explain why you think slaughtering hundreds of thousands of muslims in illegal proxy wars and regime change campaigns is less islamophobic than supporting a temporary ban on refugees from the middle east
socialism,removed,there is no regime in syria there is an elected government thats supported by most syrians us state department complains that syria has failed to join an increasingly interconnected global economy which is to say has failed to follow the neoliberal prescription of turning over its stateowned enterprises to private investors the state department is aggrieved that ideological reasons continue to prevent the assad government from liberalizing syrias economy as a result of the baathists ideological fixation on socialism privatization of government enterprises is still not widespread the economy remains highly controlled by the government the us library of congress country study of syria refers to the socialist structure of the government and economy points out that the government continues to control strategic industries mentions that many citizens have access to subsidized public housing and many basic commodities are heavily subsidized and that senior regime members have hampered the liberalization of the economy not surprised to see first world progressives cheerlead a neocolonial proxy terrorist assault against a small country which threatened no one and whose only crimes were socialism and independence the same thing happened in when selfstyled progressives likewise cheered on the rape and execution of col gaddafi and the pillage and permanent destruction of africas wealthiest and most developed country the phony college left is the biggest apologizer and enabler of century neocolonial pillage and aggression and the millions of deaths that accompany it
socialism,removed,you need to be a citizen to vote if youre a british citizen you can vote if your not you cant thats not racist or xenophobic
socialism,removed,trump doesnt blame poverty on mexicans or muslims if you actually watch his most recent speeches including the one yesterday where he attacked killarys corruption youll see that he blames poverty on neoliberalism wealthy corporate special interest groups and the corrupt politicians that do their bidding against the interests of the american people if trump was a fascist he would be blaming these problems on minorities or other countries not on massive corporate interest groups and the entire political establishment
socialism,removed,lol nationalists people should be able to participate in the politics of their locality what no no they shouldnt care to explain why you so strongly believe that anybody should be able to vote in an election regardless of citizenship or not
socialism,removed,well aware of the sub name pal my response was in relation to ops question regarding why it isnt in the news and being reported on and how can they get away with this maybe stating the glaringly obvious fact that the uk isnt a socialists wet dream would have been more to the point your response was as if i made my own post stating a political belief contrary to that of the sub which it clearly wasnt
socialism,removed,trump is a fascist he is racist nationalist homophobic sexist xenophobic and islamophobic his campaign is equally so his supporters no matter how moderate they may be compared to others serve as both an echo chamber and a loud speaker to those ideas you already said that repeating a baseless claim over and over again doesnt make it true no matter how much you would like it to furthermore trump is not proworker he is a capitalist everything he owns every position of power he has gained has come from the exploitation of labour his very existence as a capitalist pits him against the working class in every way so even if he were not a fascist he would still be an opportunist and would still be a member of the class responsible for all the shit workers are forced to endure so would you call engels an opportunist and part of the class responsible for all the shit workers are forced to endure he also came from a wealth capitalist family like engels trump is a class traitor betraying the larger interests of his class for personal fame and glory no other us politician in memory has so sharply criticized neoliberalism even though neoliberalism is hugely beneficial to the ultrarich i am not shitting on workers by pointing these things out i would be shitting on workers if i supported trump my job as a marxist is to make the case against trump as well as against hillary to make the case for a united and militant working class movement on what basis do you imagine a united and militant working class movement emerging if selfstyled socialists cant stop constantly insulting and demeaning working class people for not wanting waves of new immigrants to drive down their wages socialists do not support fascists or imperialists they support workers you do not support workers you support fascists and sooner or later this capitalist fascist scumbag is going to turncoat on his labour following and sell them up the river you dont support workers you openly express your contempt for the working class and arrogantly dismiss their fears and concerns you have an elitist classist attitude towards working people at best patronizing and paternalistic at worst hateful and openly hostile

socialism,removed,but youre advocating violence thats unacceptable vigilantism in a democratic society its not that the government wont act they will when they see the right time in the meantime they let their opponents go out and expose themselves arrest and criminalise them so they have a hard time with the rest of their life better to let things come to a head cleanly and be dealt with by the proper authorities
socialism,removed,this is the best tldr i could make reduced by im a bot as the guardian points out this has an important and likely not accidental effect it leaves the state department entirely unstaffed during these critical first weeks when orders like the muslim ban are coming down the article points out another point worth highlighting quotin the past the state department has been asked to set up early foreign contacts for an incoming administration this time however it has been bypassed and immediate circle of steve bannon michael flynn soninlaw jared kushner and reince priebus are making their own calls cbp continued to deny all access to counsel detain people and deport them in direct contravention to the order citing quotupper managementquot and the dhs made a formal statement that they would continue to follow the orders version tldrs so far pms and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome top keywords

socialism,removed,im glad you have confidence in these thugs that they were sure that no one was indside at the time also its ironic that a comment like this is being made on a subreddit dedicated to the socialist cause condsidering it will be poorly paid workers having to clean this shit up ask yourself is this really what you want to happen forget what others think is this part of the democracy that you want to live in does this actually achieve anything for me the answer to all is a resounding no
socialism,removed,fucking communists
socialism,removed,there are plenty of fascists in the us but i dont believe any socialists think mainstream republicans are strictly fascist have you looked at the other comments
socialism,removed,only feels are reals and attacking your enemies makes them feel bad pussies
socialism,removed,you dont just shoot at someone walking down the street years is well deserved
socialism,removed,it all makes sense now lol
socialism,removed,so you all dont think zimmerman was self defense
socialism,removed,and thats bad
socialism,removed,neocolonial rule
socialism,removed,because we are better than them cede the moral high ground at your own peril
socialism,removed,terrorism is defined as violence or threats of violence for political gain firebombing this building and accompanying it with a threatening message is terrorism you are advocating terrorism
socialism,removed,there are millions of people you dont agree with in the world some of them benefit from the charity you find it in yourself to give the only kind of person i would never donate to is one that would look at other human beings harmed in need of assistance and refuse them charity
socialism,removed,if a person is on your chest has you on your back and is slamming you into the ground are you allowed to shoot them if you have a gun not saying this is what happened the whole truth of the situation i dont really remember exactly what went down but in this situation i proposed could you shoot the person
socialism,removed,i dont donate to them i donate to the people helping them you know people humans
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,so you dont donate to charity because i guarantee they help people you hate
socialism,removed,that doesnt make it acceptable
socialism,removed,this has nothing to do with feeling good in any event i helped you discriminatory motherfuckers revel in the pain of others i give aid and they have my solidarity this sub has neither because you and others here do not practice what they preach
socialism,removed,would you prefer they were defeated by ideas or by terrorism what were those people doing promoting a candidate you dont like they didnt hurt anyone themselves they had the option to firebomb a leftist headquarters and did not leftists bombed them ill take my political victories hardfought earned and nonhypocritical
socialism,removed,you have no idea what his motivations where youre creating narrative to fit bias where the facts alone are insufficient
socialism,removed,faithful cogs you are to a political machine you believe clashes you and fascism together you have delusions of the grandeur of the role of labor in movements where the necessary components were actually the prevailing ideas of today those were the things that brought people of the past to fight your wars ideas humans dont go and fight other humans for progress on one hand you dismiss this liberal idea and then embrace it as your calling today capitalism is maintained globally through systemic violence and tomorrow the socialists of this sub would do the same given any power blindly alienate those with values worth supporting pat yourselves on the back and kill the rest because youll never convince the populous of anything by using the same violence you hate
socialism,removed,your a liberal everything about your ideology is hypocritical and liberals never fought hard for anything ill try to remember to fight harder for your spelling and grammar classes oh and ill throw in a few bucks to teach you a some things about generalizations
socialism,removed,ad hominem is a much better argument coming from someone who hasnt realized the internet has spellcheck yet
socialism,removed,the rise of fascism will cease when trump defeats hillary and takes office
socialism,removed,i usually try not to disagree with people here but there was also physician evidence blood in head of a struggle
socialism,removed,you want to get into a charity dick measuring contest on reddit go ahead type the biggest number you want moron those were humans in need you didnt donate to them because you believe you know what evil is fools believe they know how to tell who is evil and who isnt burn the witch
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,as when you use theirs
socialism,removed,wanting a murderer to be murdered hypocrisy
socialism,removed,im sure support of the jews came out of everyones mutual agreement that murdering was aokay thats right i forgot were only allowed to fight the people that socialists think are evil the nazis arent ideas win wars your bodies are useless
socialism,removed,it isnt any of those things
socialism,removed,thats an act of war thats different and you know it even if its not youre missing the point here the point is that this act of violence is absolutely criminal and is not okay in any regards its not okay no matter if its a gop building dnc building whatever domestic terrorism is violent and divisive and should not be tolerated so i struggle to see why youre so okay with it
socialism,removed,are your family members illegal immigrants
socialism,removed,how would you be able to survive without money would you expect food water shelter electricity for free you bring up learning a few times how would you learn without money who would teach you if you got knowledge from books how would the authors be compensated you seem incredibly selfish and naive
socialism,removed,lmao that answered my question
socialism,removed,killing someone is bad unless theyre a violent reactionary piece of shit e d g y
socialism,removed,so if i burned down a lefty building and no one got hurt you would be ok with it
socialism,removed,most tankies would get really angry with these sentiments but youre mostly right its possible that even were it not for stalin bourgeois propagandists would have still found reason to defame socialism and communism stalins actions have helped their arguments tremendously
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,resist oppressors you know whats oppressive using acts to terror to attempt to silence someone for having different opinions than you like fascists
socialism,removed,sa are a part of the cwi
socialism,removed,reeeee people sre held accountable for their actions reeeee
socialism,removed,moderate isis so just muslims oh gosh not a runofthemill muslim im so horrified
socialism,removed,because the data coming out of a communist dictatorship is super reliable also cant say ive ever met a libertarian that wanted children to starve but your story sounds cooler
socialism,removed,just like how cuba has firing squad victims
socialism,removed,did you read the methodology surveys
socialism,removed,steve bannon is not an antisemite breitbart is a company founded by a jew staffed by jews and gay people and steve bannon works with his jewish colleagues and employees on a regular basis to run breitbart he wouldnt hire jews if he didnt like them
socialism,removed,castro was marxist and he murdered and imprisoned gay people so
socialism,removed,says the guy who went to college where he was indoctrinated into believing that socialism was a good idea
socialism,removed,fucking idiot
socialism,removed,attending the funerals of dictators who ruthlessly murder political opposition and have a history of imprisoning gays and dissenters is not a good thing to do typically
socialism,removed,hes not helping the cause he comes off as a kid who just learned about a peoples history of the united states the previous month
socialism,removed,social democracy is basically bernie sanders democratic socialism is socialism a fundamentally flawed system that has failed horribly every time it has been attempted with a nice adjective in front to make it more palatable to impressionable teenagers
socialism,removed,remember when you are scolded or reprimanded at work by a super or boss its probably because you did something wrong if you were scolded unfairly you are free to quit your job and work for someone else if you dont want to work for someone else you are free to start your own business and work for yourself if your business fails because youre a sheltered socialist who doesnt understand how the world works you can complain about it on reddit to other sheltered socialists who dont understand how the world works
socialism,removed,for me its wealth people shouldnt be allowed to work hard to become wealthy it would be better if everyone were equally poor and had no personal incentive to work leading to widespread famine
socialism,removed,im sure hes read the gulag archipelago by aleksandr solzhenitsyn
socialism,removed,fidel was retarded colin is retarded makes sense
socialism,removed,this is what happens when you trade class struggle for identity politics
socialism,removed,cause hes a fucking moron if you know football the dudes a boob the person delivering the message is just as important as the message
socialism,removed,oh yeah you can keep dreaming dumb leftie kike also socialism neven worked
socialism,removed,i would totally suck che have you seen the man
socialism,removed,well he succeeded in getting my disdain for him
socialism,removed,when this guy didnt vote he became someone i will never listen to what a fucking idiot
socialism,removed,well i mean there were crowds for ol kim too
socialism,removed,you guys should talk to the people who are willing to swim to florida to escape cuba about how the castro regime is a western narrative lol
socialism,removed,ive been to cuba and most cubans are very reluctant to say anything negative about castro but are happy to tell you about the fact that they desperately want free internet nikes and toilet paper
socialism,removed,these surveys generally dont put it in black and white terms like the article does the survey doesnt ask is rape justifiable it instead asks if two people are drink is a sexual act rape or something along those lines for example the article says around dont consider sex rape if the victim doesnt explicitly say no thats a question more about affirmative consent than whether or not rape is justified
socialism,removed,try to read a little bit bud
socialism,removed,i think everyone agrees that physically forcing someone against their will to have sex is rape thats violent and clear i think things get much more grey in other situations if both people are drunk is it rape if a woman is drunk and the other party does not know about her intoxicated state and she comes on to him is it rape if there is no expressly given affirmative consent but your both touching each others genitals and it escalates is it rape these kinds of situations are the ones people debate about do rapists consider themselves rapists some probably do others do not the question is do you think of the population is a rapist one which openly believes rape is justified as the title of the article suggests personally i dont think so i think the majority of sexual assault occurs in these grey areas and its a difficult situation to sort out how the justice system should act to treat everyone fairly
socialism,removed,its because a quarter of europeans are from the middle east and i will probably get banned because this shitty subreddit and its shitty mods dont allow free speech the left is also allowing the middle eastern refugees access to europe and even kicking out citizens to make room
socialism,removed,probably responsible for starting the civil war and causing more divided
socialism,removed,the tankies claim it was a fascist coup attempt
socialism,removed,or you could just keep drug users locked up that works as well
socialism,removed,honestly comrade people can change political views over their lifetimes i was once a staunchly mormon girl who thought republicans offered the only moral political choice now im an atheist marxist who usually ends up voting for the democratic candidate people change just because hillary was a goldwater girl does not mean she cant change her views posthigh school shes too conservative for my personal taste but in todays political climate shes a raging progressive small steps
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,thats one proud lady
socialism,removed,but im not dumb or retarded surely i cant be the only one that thinks censoring these words will just make them cut deeper
socialism,removed,go look at raltright and then say theyre not nazis haha oh shit ok youre right i guess i thought there were more milo yiannopouloses in the altright i didnt think it was all the richard spencer type what left in power well what right in power right and left are really relative terms im saying that you could quite frankly go either way calling modern liberals like president obama right or left left is not synonymous with socialism unless the definition of socialism youre using is the same one the us republican party uses i know you marxists especially want to appropriate certain terminology for the cause but i dont think theres much weight besides the weight you make by insisting on something to saying the current establishment in the west is definitely not leftwing you might as well claim that the bourgeoisie have disproportionate control over society is the same as the jews control everything not at all i think i explained my point rather well with that last bit not every comparison between the farright and the farleft is just mindless horseshoe theory you know
socialism,removed,hello again usadistlibertine hai have you sleep deprived any homeless people while ive been away with that weird ai trotsky cult
socialism,removed,spot the one with the lazy eye
socialism,removed,well here i go purgin again also lenin probably
socialism,removed,stop right there thoughtcriminal scum are you implying that people with opposing opinions shouldnt be viciously stomped out how dare you insinuate that we should have to tolerate reading words we dont like do not even almost imply that rsocialism s moderators are dangerously unleashing undeserved fury against your fellow thoughtcriminals anybody that says anything yucky on this sub should be fucking annihilated if anybody says anything that could almost maybe probably be interpreted as racist sexist homophobic fascistic antisocialist or anything else unfashionable they can get fucked if it were up to me theyd be shot or sentenced to death by fire and magnet fucking thoughtcriminal scum be gone pestilent mods mods mods mods mods mods ban this urchin at once

socialism,removed,national socialist are nationalist that hijack socialist stuff my ideology is just marxism but is combined w neostalinism neosovietism world revolutionarism proantitheismatheismmaterialismnaturalism and other stuff

socialism,removed,how the altright stopped reading there and for that i dont thank you
socialism,removed,jews are over rated yeah they are smart motherfuckers but they just sort of tend to keep to themselves
socialism,removed,this is alex jones level of reporting with outright false accusations that are literally only the opinion of the writer this sub must be a joke good luck with your fantasy dudes
socialism,removed,i heard that trump killed a whole bag of kittens because he didnt want them near his tower
socialism,removed,do you fucking retards actually think you can win a war against the rednecks who farm your food pump your oil and comprise your military jesus christ riamverybadass
socialism,removed,please please please please take up arms im begging you
socialism,removed,lol breitbart is altright white nationalist antisemetic why did they hire a gayforeignjew httpwwwbreitbartcommilo seriously this is ridiculous
socialism,removed,altright originates on pol gamergate on v plenty of leftwingers are in gamergate theyre completely different and seperate movements and gamergate is largely nonpolitical
socialism,removed,wait so you think bribing reviewers with sex is something which should be encouraged
socialism,removed,kikes
socialism,removed,we are going to make america great again
socialism,removed,move to sweden
socialism,removed,probably a better choice than the spirit cooking pedophile john podesta how exactly do you have israel cheering but hire a alleged antisemite
socialism,removed,still better than a socialist socialists are like i exist give me stuff i produced nothing they produced a lot give me half work hard and be a winner dont be lazy loser thats just the way reality is
socialism,removed,so you pigeon hole any one who has different views than you not very open minded to say the least
socialism,removed,to be fair there are a lot of sanders and clinton supporters protesting trump right now i dont think its fair to say progressives or liberals are silent about trump neoliberalism brings fascism we should definitely protest trump but the neoliberal policies brought trump its important to not just react to trump but also a broader context of what is going on by letting up on the political correctness a little we need to stop calling people racist if theyre not literally burning a cross in klan robes there are solid critiques of how neoliberals failed to emphasize with white working class voters these critiques range from progressives like greenwald and naomi klein to socialists like socialist alternative and socialist worker not all trump supporters are kkksexistsracists in fact most of them are not there is a history of the democratic party completely abandoning white working class voters these voters then went to rightwing media this is part of my problem with many on the left they shut down all conversation of trump supporters by calling them racistssexistsfascists its far more complex than that of course we should oppose oppression of muslims but this is not mutually exclusive with also emphasizing with the white working poor and ensuring that it is only rightwing elements that pay attention to them the sanders supporters you talked to are definitely mean spirited but your analysis of trump supporters seems mean spirited too
socialism,removed,your value is tied directly to how much you produce and youre lying to yourself if you think otherwise i can see the appeal of your belief you produce little but you want more so you want to take it from someone else quite pathetic good luck with your theftbased movement i can also see why you want to ignore survival of the fittest reality you are not the fittest and you know it
socialism,removed,something something
socialism,removed,not not jews he hates juice
socialism,removed,lol youve demonstrated your complete lack of knowledge of what a fascist is while at the same time cementing the idea that the left is incapable of holding a debate and resorting to everyone who disagrees with me is a nazi
socialism,removed,of jews are in the top in the us
socialism,removed,despite what the right may have you think civilized humans are just that civilized then why are we importing millions of barbarians into our countries and with you people supporting it
socialism,removed,jeezus krist your spelling
socialism,removed,hippo croc apothecary
socialism,removed,they do control the banks and media its just that the only day they can plan anything is when the rest of us are distracted christmas just wait until after that for things to get turned around
socialism,removed,haha are you fucking serious guy did you miss the part where the fbi colluded with the trump campaign to release the zomg new ermerlz letter right as early voting was opening seriously what part of her life wasnt microscopically laid to bare this election
socialism,removed,everyone who agrees with ultra nationalism large amounts of racial discrimination hyper capitalism and xenophobia is a facist trump is a nationalist i dont think you can call him an ultranationalist a call for violence is required to make that leap and only his opponents are violent at the moment obama nor hrc have come out against this violent left its appears and strictly from facts that the left are the more violent people large amounts of racial discrimination this implies that you are ok with small amounts and that amounts of racism can be measured i would be interested to see one act of racial discrimination on trumps part i can provide several different articles before the election time frame that shows trump is anything but a racist hes been praised by al sharpton and jesse jackson for his community inclusiveness he demanded that all races and religions be invited to join his country club during a time when african americans and jewish were not allowed xenophobe the fear of other cultures youre talking about a business man whothrough out his entire life has done business with defferent cultures all over the world a man who married a lady from slovenia your opinions arent based in fact or reality you listen to a couple cnn talking points and then regurgitate them back to the public do some independent research
socialism,removed,media matters is owned by george soros he sold jews out to the nazis during
socialism,removed,reactionaries being the rsocialism version of calling people cucks
socialism,removed,as fucking ridiculous and divorced from reality as everything you just said is it seems grounded at least in a belief in some kind of belief that the power lies with us not with politicians embedded within the state machinery then again maybe im just wrong for originally only considering political positions that werent idiotic in my post i cant decide
socialism,removed,liberals and like minded people will take any headline they can read its honestly disgusting they called breitbart a white supremacist newspaper but they fail to include that it was started by andrew breitbarta jew
socialism,removed,hahaahah holy shit you jews are dishonest your media has been trying to destroy him for over a year now the goyim won for once off to israel with you out out out
socialism,removed,i know what the dictionary definition is but thanks buddy im speaking of how the term is used here anyone that disagrees or dissents from the majority opinion is branded a reactionary until they fall in line or get banned same as rthed or pol calling people cucks until the same result is achieved
socialism,removed,everyone here is aware that trumps daughter is jewish right
socialism,removed,this sub is full of retards his daughter is jewish you bunch of idiots
socialism,removed,ivanka trump converted to judaism i wonder what conversation they had about that
socialism,removed,hate to break it to you but here comes reality having many political planners backers and family memebers as jewish decent trump not only is not hitler or a neo nazi but is instead the most pro semetic political candidate there has ever been
socialism,removed,they started out by putting pressure on nerd companies and nerd media and it was largely successful because everyone was afraid of them this is a complete rewrite of actual history what youre seeing now is a backlash against what those people were complaining about that a small minority of loud ass people bullied an industry they didnt even have any investment in because they met almost no opposition besides people they could yell racist and mysoginist at until they stopped fighting they tried to expand their ridiculous beliefs into mainstream culture the problem is you cant just yell racist and mysoginist forever without having a real point you can only shut down the conversation for so long with those kinds of tactics people wont put up with you denigrating them forever they know we dont live in a rape culture they know they arent racists they know they arent mysoginists theyre sick and tired of being told that their opinions arent valid and that theyre on the wrong side of history because they disagree with some year old college kids unassailable position they should have been vigorously fought back against since people didnt do that they were given the opportunity to grow this is the only accurate part of your post but you framed the wrong side as being the idiots if companies had told them to fuck off and the news didnt give them any coverage and idiots running committees didnt invite them to come speak about their ridiculous world views we wouldnt be in this position today but they did the opposite they caved they empowered them and they got bold and assumed they were actually right and took their ideas to every other aspect of our culture where people who previously wouldnt have cared at all suddenly were faced with similar abuse and now theyre tired of this garbage too
socialism,removed,good job providing an example of exactly what i was talking about you cant just call people racist and sexist because they dont agree with you or i mean you can but it leads you right back to the position youre in now
socialism,removed,not once did i say sexism doesnt exist you can go back and read it i havent edited it nowhere does it say what i did say is that threatening video game makers over sexism or racism or literally anything else you dont like in their games while not even being a consumer of the media and pretending like its a huge problem is stupid its like going to an italian food place when you dont eat italian food and complaining they dont make sushi then threatening to boycott them until they start making sushi in that example everyone would tell you that youre being an idiot no one would stick up for you and blame the restaurant for not catering to your tastes is there sexism in games sure some games is there sexism in movies sure some movies is there violence in games and movies are there movies and games with some abhorrent themes sure some of them are these problems we need to fix fuck no we live in a society where anyone is free to create any form of media they want with any story and any themes you are free to not support a company or individual that makes media you do not agree with you are free to make your own media with whatever themes you like what you are not free to do is tell people what they can make and what they can like you cant tell me i am a sexist because i support peoples freedom of expression it doesnt work like that i dont have to enjoy something to believe that people have the freedom to make it in the same way i can support freedom of speech it doesnt mean i agree with the guy screaming kill all kikes just because i think he has every right in the world to say his stupid ass opinion
socialism,removed,oh right trumphitler forgot about that
socialism,removed,claiming to be antifascist while enthusiastically supporting torturing and killing people for their political beliefs
socialism,removed,by making him think his stupid ass opinion is okayyoure far worse youre creating an environment where antisemitism can thrive all in the name of muh free speech you enable people like that and we went full circle if you cant even agree that the first amendment is important and should be protected how can you be surprised when more than half the country wont tolerate your viewpoint anymore taking away peoples freedom of expression doesnt prevent ideas from existing it only gives them power a guy screaming on a street corner is a lot more impotent than someone whos idea has been declared so dangerous it cant even be heard anymore
socialism,removed,silencing debate you do know that this sub as well as any other communistsocialistmarxist sub on reddit censors nonstop anyone who even questions them for fucks sake you people are literally against free speech with your bad memes freeze peach xd jesus christ
socialism,removed,meanwhile none of you have jobs and besides how does an outcome of a fair and free election attack you as a worker exactly oh your team didnt win so youre gonna cry now like a little baby gu gu ga ga cuck
socialism,removed,stop pretending youre correct
socialism,removed,median salary of a trump supporter is these people work hard and earn their living unlike you parasites
socialism,removed,we believe in one that doesnt instead you believe in one that lets starvation and death camps happen i would rather be unemployed thank you very much oh youre very cucked have you read marx and engels on family and malefemale relations they were literally honest to god cuckolds they literally advocated for wife sharing so yes every single socialistcommunist is a cuck the insult isnt even funny to use because youre literally it
socialism,removed,theres a big difference between some jewish comedian and a jewish billionaire subverting countries and destroying economies like george soros does no fascist cares about useless jews
socialism,removed,well technically any head would fit between a boot and a curb including yours
socialism,removed,if you are antiisrael you are endangering the lives of the of the worlds jews who live there and arguably all those in the diaspora too that is why being full on against the existance of israel is definitely antisemitic
socialism,removed,suck on a sabot round
socialism,removed,because its the nfl with rights and image contracts not some protest on the side of the street douche bag

socialism,removed,im glad hes doing this because he is so oppressed damn having to accept milllions of dollars for throwing a ball thats a damn shame
socialism,removed,he needs to shut it and just play ball
socialism,removed,the point is hes making millions of dollars in a country that its possible to be unfathomably rich for playing a kids game he made million dollars last year why not use some of that to do some good instead of just trying to get your name in the headlines because youre salty about losing your starting job to a mediocre white qb and need some attention
socialism,removed,he can give his millions to all those oppressed black people
socialism,removed,thats cool too however lets start with the former before trying to be malcolm x

socialism,removed,quite bad theres a long list of failures that being said he did manage to bitch slap hitler regardless if someone else was in power they may have dealt with hitler earlier
socialism,removed,funny they use their fossil fuel burning trucks to trailer their horses to protest fossil fuel transportation which is actually more environmentally friendly than having semis literally haul of fuel at a time from north dakota to texas those trucks get im sure shes not burning sticks to heat her tp either jus sayin
socialism,removed,god gerards jamie jammer voice is worse than listening to a cat having its balls drug through broken glass that crazy bitch should have tazed himher google gerard dabu and you will find some funny shit on herhim and herhis worthless crew
socialism,removed,a fairytale for the losers of capitalism instead of accepting theyre just not good enough and knowing their place degenerates and other needowells blame the successful people and whine how everything should be provided by the state they dont understand society or darwinism the strong control the weak that is the natural order they would do well to accept this truth and focus on making the most of their social position and anyway most of them are just young fuck ups druggies and other types of degenerates queers bdsm freaks anarchists who will either die very young or realize what a horrible lifestyle they lead and finally turn to jesus as generates are wont to do when all other options fail you should forget about this crap pipe down and do what youre told

socialism,removed,fuck off how dare you speak for any of us when you are so obviously oblivious trumps success is the beginning of the end of dishonesty in politics imagine all those fat cat politicians with dirty money lining their pockets they know their time is nigh trump is a good thing stop bringing emotion into every little thing and lets see what happens
socialism,removed,im just saying that it sounds hypocritical ive been really critical of republicans who blanket reject things like supreme court appointments feels weird doing something similar
socialism,removed,tell me rsocialism how does it feel to get fucking bitchslapped by the white working class to have them reject you so thoroughly youll never succeed in getting an entire racial group to sign on to their own demise and displacement i hope you all feel hopeless because you should this is just the start if white people fight back when its only this bad how hard do you think well fight back when were of the population you really think youll ever succeed in the grand scheme of things prepare to get thrown into the dustbin of history forever
socialism,removed,hahahahahahahaha get fucked im lgbt black and poor and am in support of trump hillary is the manifestation of a rotten system based on war and corruption it doesnt matter if she says the right stuff on the right times for me actions speak more than words her life and family are the true representation of imperialism and neoliberalism she closes her eyes in the face of a murder and this means so much more than saying stupid shit im sick of you teenagers who think you are against the system when in fact you are being ideologically manipulated by a corrupt media bought by wallstreet it was not just media coverage it was payed propaganda hillary had deals all over the world with dictators and bankers who depended on her victory now she lost and everything turned upside down im laughing here i honestly do not care if the president is a stupid prick as long as this prevents the current foreign policies that promote war imperialism and neocolonialism are stopped stop being useful idiots you are socialists and so do i but you are being used by these filthy imperialist pigs

socialism,removed,wrong you need to drop the sjw bull shit if you are for labor be labor you should never mention race or gender again
socialism,removed,what would be the goal exactly of these protests besides just an opportunity to hate on trump like i dislike him as much as the next guy but there doesnt seem to be any point to a protest without something your tryna change
socialism,removed,step stop the sjw holier than thou crap seriously it doesnt work it doesnt help anyone become less racistsexistwhat have you all it does is divide the populace if someone is blatantly being a bigot like literally saying these people dont deserve sympathy then call them out but otherwise stop finding any excuse to call eachother names it does not work if anything its regressive
socialism,removed,as a trump supporter this is correct im also a organized communist we could not have the establishments poster child in office she had too many ties to isis and child sex trafficking
socialism,removed,socialist memes did catch on in a bunch of places throughout the century comrades for some reason they usually fell out of favour a couple of decades or so after they helped socialist parties take power
socialism,removed,socialism is not marxism ffs we can be socialist without being unrealistic marxism is unrealistic socialism isnt
socialism,removed,what exactly are you guys hoping you can do to stop him and what specific stuff do you want to stop him from doing honestly curious
socialism,removed,i believe in help for any disabled or anyone unable to work i think that socialism couldnt work because people need to be independent if everyone is supporting for everyone else whats the point of doing a really good job if my neighbor has kids thats five more mouths to feed for the state which means more mouths to feed for the the people and more taxes for me for what because they cant get condoms will the state provide condoms why should the masses control the few i just dont see the logic in it people do great things for themselves the ones with morality make it beneficial to the people as well
socialism,removed,dont reach for your icepick just yet
socialism,removed,where does that leave the creator of the company
socialism,removed,what in exactly do you hope to accomplish with this protesting will do nothing but tear america apart we need to accept our elect and stop whining it wont change the elect
socialism,removed,stay triggered
socialism,removed,cant you keep your shit country for yourself instead of pulling that shit here the us is an absolute joke and socialism wont be able to save it
socialism,removed,alright ill make a deal with you if i have to be ashamed for someone else beating up an old man which is reprehensible then you have to be ashamed for this racist kids hate speech against his classmates but im sure all those people were acting of their own volition unlike the people whose actions youre blaming us for
socialism,removed,socialism comrades get the fck outta here you poser piece of pusser
socialism,removed,i hear you and ive never been to this sub before but if you really want to reach more people i think you need to drop the whole comrade bit its offputting for those who grew up with the whole soviet threat thing crammed down their throats even if theyre fully progressive politically
socialism,removed,the working classes will never be be for open borders
socialism,removed,liberal as fuck
socialism,removed,now more than ever we must not lend support to the bourgeois press no guardian hack will ever lift a finger for us the hypocritical standards of bourgeois freedom arent worth the time of day
socialism,removed,youre all cucks
socialism,removed,lets get drumfh u guys how dare someone win a democratic election fuck peaceful transfer of power
socialism,removed,sad that we cant have a political discussion without assumptions and insults thrown around no wonder trump won
socialism,removed,reform socialism is liberal in all but name
socialism,removed,i mean for example political correctness bigotry eg seeing sex as a bad thing puritanism scape goating media on the violence argument eg videogames movies books etc make people violent argument divisive sexism eg attacking some gender saying everything is their fault antielitimism anticlicque socalled journalists circle jerking or fighting inner circles of any types etc

socialism,removed,salt is a party that has rapists and rape apologists in its ranks
socialism,removed,for example ignoring some problem in a country to not damage the relation with it statements like we are deeply concerned and then they do nothing or also in a game or a book avoiding to create a black or lesbian nemesis to not stir problems with those groupings of people or semantically calling a black or african person people of colour to not offend someone i really do not understand what is to be offended like they do in my country italy by the way i am white in reality pink like the black in reality are brown so i am not a person of colour for them but i am clearly not transparent etc
socialism,removed,they have a rapist in it who is protected by peter taaffee so good luck on trying to get them out from an elitist org that has no accountability or democracy
socialism,removed,dont its pointless
socialism,removed,why is a glorified liberal being posted here
socialism,removed,none that we know of if any did come up then i doubt very much that they would be dealt with in any appropriate manner considering the past record of party members such as the mods here and even the leading members such as peter taaffe
socialism,removed,what do you people think you are going to accomplish they are not going to dismantle the democratic process because of a few whining commies
socialism,removed,not two at least four sections one of which is of multiple accusations this isnt something to shrug off it is an institutional problem that is being swept aside because of the basic trot need to protect the cult party they should be looked into they did look into it the exact same way that the swp and frso looked into it the party is always right
socialism,removed,noam vote democrats chomsky
socialism,removed,this is a democracy you all should be happy maga
socialism,removed,dude cops are awesome dont be stupid and they wont have to literally protect civilians from you they serve and protect the majority not minority
socialism,removed,haha this is hilarious you guys really think that blocking the entrance to trump tower and shouting is going to somehow prevent our democratic process from working as intended weve got a long road ahead understatement of the year right there
socialism,removed,comments about the video comments about whether noam chomsky is a liberal or not never change rsocialism
socialism,removed,httpsislimgsokbypjpg just losers making shit up
socialism,removed,marry me noam
socialism,removed,not that this isnt informative but people need to understand that the socialism he is talking about is leaning towards revolutionary socialism since he is talking about workers controling the means of production socialism can be a lot more moderate and you can use democratic channels and the state in order to achieve socialist goals this can for example be done through making certain institutions state owned classic example is the health system applying a progressive tax system the tax rate grows the more you earn and through a mixed economy the state imposes more regulations and taxes when it comes to private businesses and corporations i dont mean to lecture or to say what type of socialism is right or wrong i just dont want people to confuse socialism with something that needs to be extreme and since this is a video meant for newcommers i think it is important that those who are new to socialsm dont get frightened by focusing too much on the revelutionary aspect of it tldr you can be a moderate socialist overthrowing the government isnt required
socialism,removed,no saying chomsky sucks and bringing out the smear that he somehow defended the khmer rouge is why that post should be downvoted arguments about the definition of socialism are all over the thread and this sub without downvotes chomsky years before the extent of the crimes of khmer rouge became public he was correctly questioning some of what was being said about the khmer rouge and trying to highlight that similar crimes in nonredled countries were being ignored it turned out that the khmer rouge was more horrible than anyone imagined but nobody knew at the time because information wasnt getting out this is the only attack used against chomsky because his critics have been unable to find anything else to pin on him its weaksauce and has nothing to do with of his political commentary in which he widely condemns all sorts of governments and movements for their transgressions thatcher and reagan gave some physical support to khmer rouge because they hated viet nam even more when the two were on different sides of the sinosoviet split but their supporters dare to smear chomsky and some people repeat it blindly without researching
socialism,removed,no he got downvoted for regurgitating the bullshit about the khmer rouge which anybody who has looked into the claim is aware is a bunch of garbage he also got downvoted because chomsky doesnt believe that worker collectives are sufficient to bring about socialism
socialism,removed,chomsky came out repeatedly to say that they were fabrications made up by the vietnamese and that the cambodian refugees were liars if its so easy to find go ahead and cite it show us all what chomsky printed that defamed the refugees
socialism,removed,it is the gallery of the ideologues and fools who find value in chomsky but your vision is superior how even handed and fair of you
socialism,removed,a still shot of an old white male professor like noam chomsky can we stop with this bullshit identity politics if you think the video is bad because noam isnt the greatest speaker anymore thats fine i think graeber does a great job but its cool if you think thats bad also because we want fun colorful production i actually agree with that but chomsky being white has literally nothing to do with it
socialism,removed,chomsky happens to like a lot of leftcoms and left bolsheviks fwiw
socialism,removed,ive researched this question in detail before and didnt find him calling anyone a liar without evidence some cambodian refugees who werent innocent angels but partisans of particular political movements published a photo that depicted khmer rouge atrocities but had been staged in thailand which naturally made the claim questionable either way thats an academic debate from years ago trudging it out to discredit chomsky who is talking about something entirely different is terrible argument
socialism,removed,trust the government completely instead of trying to enact change
socialism,removed,hey retard are you gonna post this in every sub or is your limit
socialism,removed,nicely thriving one in venezuela why reinvent the wheel when they have all the joys of socialism going on right there
socialism,removed,probably not there are no real peasants like back in tsarist russia
socialism,removed,lets be careful to label progress made in spite of the system that failed to topple the entirety of capitalism as within the system reforms help solidify gains for the working class but only because fear of revolt chips away at the edges
socialism,removed,people like to eat people love children the annual gdp generated by human trafficking and child prostitution is large enough to feed the world still people starve still children are abused why market economics no human being would in any way approve of the policies created by market rules where the absolute worst get an unlimited supply of just about everything under the sun and the regular honest man may very well die in the gutter
socialism,removed,if you talk about the real putin he is great and surprisingly there is nothing bad known about him if you mean the putin of your tabloids he is a very bad man i invite you to read your own link and tell us how putin was caught financing neonazis do you mean le pen taking a loan from a private bank that has the word czech in its title
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,hello andrew my name is otávio engler and i am an undergraduate student of economics i am currently writting an academic work about your view against the conventional left in regards to the great recession i have questions first are you familiar with the works from both michael roberts and anwar shaikh if so are there any major disagreements that you have with their treatment of the ltfrp as the cause of the great recession second do you still keep following the movements in the rate of profit and pretend on writting something about it or do you have a new book or work in progress thank you
socialism,removed,well its just like the example i gave about financing the neonazis in europe i have access to your media and when i read any article on putin its factual bullshit interpretive dance thus in the end when you collect together everything you know about putin there is nothing bad there
socialism,removed,
socialism,removed,i find militant religious people and militant atheists can be just as annoying except militant atheists are less likely to engage in terrorism
socialism,removed,how retarded are these people are you actively trying to make it even harder for you to actually get the reform you want they started off with instead of defending the many innocent black people who get shot trying to make big deals over several cases where armed black people who had committed crimes shouldnt be shotnow this do you guys stop and think about strategy likeat all i thought being a dick to bernie on the mic was going to be the low point but you guys just keep plumbing new depths of utter stupidity palestinians arent even black if palestinians are black then we might as well just pretend whoever looks like anything is what we want them to be might as well call rachel dolezal black at this point since actual ethnicity apparently isnt even considered jesus fucking christ
socialism,removed,in brazil criminals and gangs force kids between and to carry out most murders cuz they legally cant be prosecuted as adults there if anything this could help protect palestinian children from their own people
socialism,removed,i recall the last time communism tried doing that i recall something about hunger and dying but of course that was just propaganda
socialism,removed,if superman decides to take over the city
socialism,removed,you would think that but if he donated all his money to charity
socialism,removed,but he realized that joe chill and countless others like him
socialism,removed,did he just beat him up for the hell of it if so why would you donate him money
socialism,removed,and this is why if we want citizens to have access to firearms we need thorough mental health screens before handing them guns
socialism,removed,itt rleftwithsharpedge
socialism,removed,unarmed robbery probably of an individual
socialism,removed,fascists are human need to me
socialism,removed,itt people just as bad a dylan roof for reasons they are oblivious to
socialism,removed,maybe a liberal like youd say something like that
socialism,removed,this is such a vague and useless defence you can literally justify anything a poor person does with this
socialism,removed,stafford of goose creek south carolina is being held at the jail on charges of strong armed robbery and firstdegree assault and battery the post and courier reports he is also facing a charge of providing false information to a police officer court records show he has been arrested on more than a dozen misdemeanor charges since according to the newspaper what a hero really exemplifies the sort of man all socialists should strive to be
socialism,removed,were all shaped by our environments to a certain extent but we all have a choice about who we are as people you dont say that about poor people who commit crimes roof was raised in a shitty environment to believe shitty things and did a horrible crime
socialism,removed,we should just let fascists go on to rape and murder and indoctrinate everyone he should be in a real prison that offers rehabilitation and counseling what a shame that they largely dont exist here in the states but well advocate it for everyone except those people we dont like
socialism,removed,just another socialist promoting violence
socialism,removed,how much will you give me to kill his parents
socialism,removed,wew this thread is fun
socialism,removed,wrong socialist alternative well i suppose it kind of fits the question
socialism,removed,yeah lets go ahead and reward people for violence thats how we really need our society to work
socialism,removed,rthedonald i am a bot i link the subreddits mentioned in the title for easy navigation
socialism,removed,this thread is a perfect example of how revanchist and cruel american attitudes towards prison are
socialism,removed,selfdefense is something that has to be judged on a individual basis this would only be selfdefense if the perpetrator had a legitimate fear for his own safety i dont know if that criteria is met here
socialism,removed,an individual act of violence is so revolutionary i just can feel social relations changing before my eyes 😯
socialism,removed,white people in this thread calling him mentally ill are if they know it or not defending him i defend every criminal and terrorist from the perspective that theyre human beings who have their own motives and views that are born out of unique experiences i think thats called empathy
socialism,removed,liberal wants to fight argue human nature summon gulag express persuasion flee
socialism,removed,agentprovocateur
socialism,removed,huh his party is centerleft to leftwing this is a discussion i said my interpretation of duterte and now i might get banned interesting
socialism,removed,lies there is not such thing as a white cab driver
socialism,removed,a friendly reminder that there are serious cultural divides between the populations of different countries east and west dont categorize them well as shown by the huge ranges within regions on the graph but its important to remember that conflict can arise from serious cultural disagreements it would be comforting if we could blame all our problems on a select few but that is not the world we live in
socialism,removed,ice cubes thoughts on black police brutality on black police brutality on black police brutality on black police brutality on black civilians
socialism,removed,you dont think its relevant that blacks have killed almost as many blacks as whites have whites despite being only a fraction of the population
socialism,removed,no its because the relevant statistical metric is not percentage but rate or frequency jesus this thread gave me cancer
socialism,removed,this is the biggest false circlejerk ive ever seen until i realized the subredditrsocialism
socialism,removed,im just pointing out that blacks kill each other at a rate approximately five times that at which whites kill whites so there is not really an unjustified complete double standard as you suggest
socialism,removed,i have noticed this user attacking the soviet union on more than one occasion why is he allowed to post on the rsocialism subreddit
socialism,removed,were you one of the night it was a victim of material conditions
socialism,removed,leftcoms are exhausting
socialism,removed,obvious anarchist bourgeois shill is obvious
socialism,removed,but white people compose roughly of the population since that includes most hispanics whereas black people compose of the population if whiteonwhite violence is of violence against white victims then that is the expected proportion if there were no racial bias at all in violent crime
socialism,removed,and you freaks wonder why we slew your god holed up in mexico lol
socialism,removed,im actually oppressing a black person now s
socialism,removed,reactionaries gonna react i have done more for communism than your entire fucking tendency theckanick licker
socialism,removed,men clearly have a violent culture these are people with problems and they are a significant minority that we arent going to be another demonstration at the governors mansion a few times
socialism,removed,ive become super conscious of the night it was just going to be safe
socialism,removed,and we never talk about how white on white crime does not happen at the governors mansion a few times
socialism,removed,i bet your a white kid in high school huh
socialism,removed,is this post not sectarian
socialism,removed,the commonaverage sentencing for soviet prisons during stalins time was actually about years hardly decades lol
socialism,removed,but you know what the bad part of the night it was just going to be negatively affected
socialism,removed,so glad you included the link if you read the homicide section you linked me fully instead just picking the closest numbers that dont actually mean anything youd see that it says the offending rate for blacks is almost times higher than whites the percentages you guys keep reporting as proof are just that meaningless percentages just bc theyre both near doesnt mean white people kill white people just as often you have to look at the rates if in month white people are murdered with of them by white people thats white on white murders now if in that same time period black people are murdered with of them by black people thats also but the rate is times higher reporting is barely anything its racism that makes you think its more is misleading and out right lying about what is truly happening hate to break it to you but black people kill black people at a way higher rate than white pepole kill white people you have to look at the total data and not just pick two close numbers
socialism,removed,all hail brave papa franco for saving spain from the degenerates
socialism,removed,thats a weird way of saying i wanna say retard but dont wanna be criticized
socialism,removed,it was a retarded ass statement cops an invading force i bet of your comments are shit wrapped up in dookie
socialism,removed,ah well i assumed cause your statement sounded like it came from an angsty teenager
socialism,removed,terrible taste you have then
socialism,removed,autism
socialism,removed,you can just tell he thinks hes really really special and onto something that personal value is determined by who has more and he wants you to know how much he has
socialism,removed,the white man has been holding us down for far too long no longer will we remain silent socialists have persecuted colored folk too long
socialism,removed,feminism is just manhating it was just veiled better before
socialism,removed,i dont get the comrade thing im not your comrade or your friend im not even your acquaintance please dont act like you know me its effing creepy
socialism,removed,republicans nazis lmao quality political insight there ya yo fruitcake
socialism,removed,is fruitcake homophobic i mean calling someone a fruit certainly is but doesnt fruitcake mean like nut or crazy
socialism,removed,i actually completely agree and i am a lesbian so you cant argue against me either
socialism,removed,true but republicans trump supporters in particular tend to be a bunch of pussies who cant handle people expressing their displeasure in trump ie trump shouldnt be here what are the chances theyd actually ask to have colbert be there seems more plausible imo that colbert just walked up to the podium and did his thing
socialism,removed,great video lsr is so naive honestly people like him worry me when the revolution comes it will be people like him who try to destroy it tbh well need to do something to the anarchistsultras and trotskyites
socialism,removed,ive heard it used both ways
socialism,removed,lmao trots are getting pissed you sad you guys never actually did anything well you should be at least until you become a student of one of the various sciences these being marxismleninism marxismleninismmaoism and juche until than youre nothing but a liberal
socialism,removed,it destroyed national unity and strength this worker uprising destroyed all the strength and unity stalin brought
socialism,removed,source
socialism,removed,what can we do as marxists to combat this rampant transphobia other than call it out at every avenue as marxists nothing because marxism is not about your fucking dickphobia
socialism,removed,lockherup what a farce it was the clinton a third generation bush and trump whats so perceptive about trumps campaign make america great again is that even the average american knows their country is going down the toilet as usual the left is useless and the best the american left could do was get behind hilary the us is ripe for an inssurrection and trump could easily start one if he were inclined
socialism,removed,why is it called the october revolution if it began in november am i being stupid or something
socialism,removed,problem with stein is she panders to conspiracy theorists and has abosultely no idea what she is doing she isnt a good representative of the green party imo sighs why cant we just have a good old bloody revolution
socialism,removed,you voted your conscience and you have nothing to apologise for voting that way i would have voted hrc though i live in the uk although im american and the way brexit has given the right a free pass to indulge in some truly fascistic thinking is something i fear greatly for in regards to the us
socialism,removed,i voted her but only because i live in a key swing state with a tradition of conservatism stein wasnt even on our ballot if clinton wins and her republican opponent in years isnt a bid for an ideological push towards ultra nationalism she wont have my vote that time around
socialism,removed,my take on the election as a european i understand that both major parties are majorly corrupt i am fully aware that the democratic party and hilary clinton will not bring about any meaningful change i understand that the democrats have become completely ineffective at working for working class issues and that they take minority votes for granted i understand that voting democrat wont bring an end to the racism sexism and classism that plagues us american society but voting for a third party candidate isnt a solution either voting for jill stein or gary johnson will accomplish exactly nothing the frustration youre feeling towards the corrupt two party system isnt a sign that you need a different party its a sign that electoral politics wont be enough and will never be enough to solve your problems dont sell yourself that youre making a statement the powers that be dont give a shit about your statement voting for a third party is the lazy persons radicalism its a way for you to part yourself on the back and feel superior if you want change take to the streets organize stop confining yourself to the methods that the ruling class has deemed acceptable direct action gets shit done voting for the green party does not the alternative you have to clinton is actual fascism the word fascism has somewhat lost its punch in recent years we used it to describe bush and tony blair and the tea party those werent fascists were they terrible sure but they werent fascists donald trump really can be correctly described as a fascist fascism runs a platform on how far down the nation has fallen fascism promises to bring the nation to a glorious mythological past it sets up a strongman as a leader a lewd aggressive arrogant violent hyper masculine even silly character go find a video of hitler or mussolini delivering a speech theyre silly characters they seem funny until they suddenly arent nobody takes the fascist rhetoric seriously until its too late nobody really believes hes literally going to try to build a wall just like nobody really believed he was literally going to try to get rid of all the jews fascism scapegoats minorities to mask the fact that it offers no real solutions if someone can be made into an other they can be made into an enemy this is donald trumps platform the top priority has to be to defeat him so this november set aside your principled radicalism so that it doesnt interfere with your practical antifascim and vote for hillary clinton we can talk about revolution on november
socialism,removed,i voted for her because yes there are a lot of shitty things about america today and those will likely continue under her presidency but im think of my friends who are people of color who identify as lgbtq women and more they will be much more likely to be affected by a trump presidency than a hillary presidency didnt like it but it wasnt a vote for my wellbeing
socialism,removed,which story do we believe both are obviously yellow journalism based on the rhetoric used not a neutral tone to be found if we go by these two news sources either the evil israeli zionists torture and kill children for fun or the palestinians are hatefilled animals willing to sacrifice their children to kill a jew reacting to either news story is stupid and not pointing out that both sides in the conflict are wrong for different reasons is a travesty of justice remember that over time the lines of victim and abuser become blurred as the victim seeks revenge and becomes victimiser
socialism,removed,voted clinton coz i live in a red state i would have voted green party if im in a blue state we have a berniecrat here and voted for him and my friends and family too even the ones who voted trump i wrote in haramebe for the unopposed ones and told my friends and family to write in harambe too for the unopposed republicucks
socialism,removed,but youre wrong bitch
socialism,removed,in ohio this means you voted trump
socialism,removed,yeahhhh i voted clinton because im in florida and fuck that if i were in ca you bet your ass id vote green for the sake of strengthening the party
socialism,removed,just a few days ago i read that the americas most infamous racist organisation it would seem can see the difference between hilary clinton and donald trump but thats not all every misogynist thinks theres a difference between clinton and trump every antisemite thinks theres a difference every homophobe thinks theres a difference every islamophobe thinks theres a difference this is what i say in response to those who equate trump and clinton even though clinton is evidently an imperialist warmonger and a wall st shill trump poses a serious threat to minorities who should be allies of the socialist movement it is for this reason that i believe that socialists should vote strategically for clinton to prevent a trump presidency
socialism,removed,her entire campaign is predicted on the sexist notion that people should vote for her because she is female instead of on her issues and ability thats more sexist than any of the terrible remarks trump said thats rather strange to say granted her appeals to vote for her purely based on her sex is rather ridiculous but its wrong to suggest that her latent sexist message doesnt even compare to trumps blatant misogyny theyre both horrendous how you choose between them is up to you personally i gave them both the finger for myself for my son for the future i want to see but arguably one is worse than the other clinton is hawkish representative of financial institutions etc but she doesnt even compare to trumps white nationalism and militarism
socialism,removed,i voted for clinton not because i have any illusions that she is anything but a neoliberal warmongering imperialist but because i consider trump a fascist and i think it would be very dangerous if trump ends up losing the election but winning or even being close enough to pretend he won the popular vote hes already been floating the idea that he will reject the legitimacy of the outcome if he loses and his followers have shown a penchant for violence targeting racial ethnic and religious minorities even when things are going well for their candidate i also dont attach any idealistic significance to voting my conscience so i dont really care that i missed my opportunity to vote for stein or write in a socialist candidate if i based my voting behavior on political idealism i would boycott the election on the grounds that voter participation in the affairs of the bourgeois state only serves to legitimate its claim to be a democratic institution that represents the will of the masses
socialism,removed,he was salty that nobody agreed with him and wouldnt calm down so he was kicked out where he proceeded to whine that the ussr wasnt socialism because he wasnt the leader inspiring generations of socialists to support the imperialists instead of the ussr
socialism,removed,oh god i did not will have to go check that out
socialism,removed,i think trump will win and indeed as chris cutrone asked
socialism,removed,voted for stein but i know this wont be popular here but i wish trump wins i think and hope more socialists look beyond the cult of personality the media throws at our faces for these bourgeoisie elections
socialism,removed,am i the only accelerationist on this subreddit hoping for a trump win
socialism,removed,yes i voted for clinton no im not sorry i refuse to let a fascist win when my state is somewhat competitive
socialism,removed,just a heads up if u post u voted for clinton u will be banned eyeroll
socialism,removed,regarding the smear of steins unscientific stances the final blow was delivered by nobody but stein herself during her first and especially her second desaterous ama if that narrative is what makes millennials not vote for you you dont go on reddit and pour you statement into the concrete that being downvoted to hell and becoming the meme of the day is i watched many videos debunking the smears against stein by the humanist report jimmy dore show redacted tonight and many of them held so far but that second ama on nuclear power and gmos that was godaweful still the best candidate but what a way to waste your chance to be the only reasonable candidate between the orange fascist and the bribed corporate cunt
socialism,removed,i just voted for jill of the gp over the swp please dont gulag me comrades otoh i figured getting the gp over the threshold might have an actual effect on things if there were any effect in voting at all either way heres to organizing in the here and now for a better worker controlled america
socialism,removed,i agree with you completely whats the point of a leftist political class that despises working class people they cant keep up with the cosmopolitan view of sex and gender so theyre treated like subhumans by feminists they cannot stifle racism in their communities because neoliberalism liberalism and even social democracies dont protect them or their lives from competition with the developing world from immigration policy designed to drop wages in all sectors of labor and even now in tech the average real deal working class person would be instantly banned from any of the left subreddits while being referred to as trash theres no outreach theres no compassion is it any surprise that the role of the american left in the past years has been to help democrats get elected no these are people who think working class means having a job while succeeding in college looking at the responses here the most popular comments are pure condescension hell i wouldnt flinch if half of this subreddit voted for clinton today if a genuine leftist populism overtook the working class of america nearly everyone here would hate their guts while helping democrats crush them
socialism,removed,this sub exists lmfao what a joke drown yourselves
socialism,removed,until you take up ethical vegetarianism you dont have grounds to stand on most things getting aborted are far less intellectual than the bacon you had for brekkist
socialism,removed,op absolutely should not have been banned that heshe was banned reflects poorly on this sub i am a nonchristian prolifer women have a right to their own bodies and to engage in sex consensually however the evolutionary purpose of sex is reproduction when people freely choose to have sex they should understand that even with perfect contraceptive use there is the chance that a child will be conceived should this happen a woman would be carrying another person who has rights this would also be the case if the conception was a result of rape but in that case the moral burden for the abortion would lie upon the rapist who through his act showed a total disregard for life the woman can morally choose to abort women who choose to keep and love children that come from rape are saints in my book the parasite argument is a joke to me yes the unborn child is a parasite totally dependent on the mother does this change once its born is a year old any less parasitic than a fetus it cant get its own food it cant produce anything its totally dependent on someone for its survival so infanticide is okay right how about people who have severe handicaps theyre parasites can we kill them the weak the dependent and the unwanted are just burdens that we should be free to get rid of sounds like a fascist argument to me perhaps i should make a thread asking whether someone can be a socialist and not be prolife
socialism,removed,dont tell that to ranarchism theyll ban you before you hit send
socialism,removed,though we may be reactionaries we are not fascists i have tried to reach out to a few socialists in my day to have a conversation but in my experience all anyone wants to do is insist we are fascists hell bent on a totalitarian state hard to have a conversation or win people over if you insist someone is something they arent this rampant labeling done by the left in general not just socialists that has no basis in reality is one of the number one things driving support to us
socialism,removed,all fascism is also authoritarian by nature us altrighters are not authoritarian as we are very passionate about free speech and expressioneven expression we disagree with dissent is the highest form of patriotism after all we are actually quite antiauthoritarian which precludes any fascism if you want to say we are a bunch of right wing nationalists that is correctbut not fascist or authoritarian by any means we are actually quite libertarian in a lot of ways it just doesnt happen to be the left wing flavor of that kind of idealism i also didnt say the op was implying that we were all fascists but it is a label i frequently seen thrown at ususually anytime we disagree or say we believe in national sovereignty i know not all socialists are quite that ridiculous about it but it is a very common occurrence
socialism,removed,you can fucking die commie when i come in the night into your gun free home put a gun in your wifes mouth and blow her fucking brains out in front of your children who i proceed to beat to death with a brick before finishing you

socialism,removed,if the world is unwilling to enter the light i will drag them into it kicking and screaming if i have to we should force everybody to believe in our ideology so the world can be a better place violence is the only way
socialism,removed,socialists always lose even when they win
socialism,removed,socialism a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production distribution and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole now when you have people living in a commune that means that community could be self sufficient and socialist when it comes cities countries and nations as a whole it means that the state runs the industry and it turns into communism its a great way for a society to drive itself into the ground it fails to provide an adequate incentive for improving oneself so people will operate using the minimum amount of effort needed to produce something its basically the antithesis of america and the reason america is the worlds superpower today instead of communist russia its a failed socioeconomic theory that was created by a degenerate named marx
socialism,removed,srssucks should understand srs

socialism,removed,not for you people actually want the ability to improve their station on their own you are the one giving government more control dont be surprised when they use it you moron
socialism,removed,at least something is static your desire to blame everything but failed ideology
socialism,removed,i would bet a great many people are involved in social justice movements just because it provides a free pass to be assholes i think youve got something there
socialism,removed,so why did millions of people die of starvation under stalin because it was so successful
socialism,removed,ban if he lived in an actual socialist country he would have been jailed or killed for that i hope this incident makes you rethink your views

socialism,removed,yea they should really have all those leftcom revolutionaries instead
socialism,removed,lenin was kicked out of russia for his political work there and instead of giving up while in exile he kept working with his party and is therefore obviously a worker hating capitalist fatcat who literally never read marx once and drove a car that ran on the blood of anarchist children the leftcoms in here

socialism,removed,wew lad
socialism,removed,the guy was a scumbag on hitler level proportions
socialism,removed,the availability of the large resources rich schools have is directly correlated to vastly more educated students ofcourse i am not ruling out funding all together i just think it plays a very minor role in the success of a student even in poor neighborhoods im sure students have a vast amount of resources available to them just from their teachers i doubt many would deny a children help on school work if students actually to initiative to seek help my speculation is that being surrounded by like minded individuals during youth will determine your focus lower income black communities tend to have an unfortunate promotion of mischief among peers which discourages certain students to excel lower income asian neighborhoods tend to promote focus on studies among youth same with richer schools time a parent spends helping a child do homework and academic achievement i personally dont think a child needs much assistance from their guardians with higher grade school in general as long as they are taught proper work ethics as a youth i hate to admit it but i just dont think any amount of funding would be able to change the work ethics of a student work ethics being the most important thing in being successful
socialism,removed,i dont agree gould was found to be a fraud on this exact issue and current science has iq heritable at httpsenwikipediaorgwikiheritabilityofiq
socialism,removed,when you say racial and ethnic diversity like its a selling point you sound like a bot pretending to be a democrat
socialism,removed,not of equal determination and motivation though
socialism,removed,are there actual people who insist that any of the things you talk about be dropped from discussion im pretty sure most of the dissent you might see revolves around the absence of a classbased approach all the issues you mentioned are important and part of the struggle but class is the big one and oftentimes modern leftist circles seem to forget that
socialism,removed,tax dollars prison system congress

socialism,removed,increased productivity can be directly attributed to technological advances not people working harder those technological advances were made thanks to capitalism
socialism,removed,how can education be a right are you going to force the teachers to teach against their will
socialism,removed,unions are reactionary institutions that rely on the labor capital relation to exist at their best they win higher wages and at their worst they stifle strikes and act as a counterrevolutionary force it should be well remembered that socialism will put an end to unions as they currently exist and that we have no reason to fetishize them
socialism,removed,highly doubtful
socialism,removed,how is that enforced
socialism,removed,whats the pc answer i dont want get banned for thoughtcrime
socialism,removed,i am sadly astonished at the lack of reverence for the division of labor and knowledge
socialism,removed,banned even removed again you dare you call yourself a communist shameless anyway darling why was i banned when you ban some for thoughtcrime at least tell me why and my no mystake im a ranking member of a communist partry so bit me hope i never get your real name
socialism,removed,correct me if im wrong but in a socialist society the people protect one another and look out for whats best for one another okay so what about criminals who commit crimes of murder or violence who administers justice on behalf of the victim the people okay so cops are pigs and are only there to oppress the people and be the long arm of the government bent on keeping the people at the heel of it how does disarming the people fix this how does one protect themselves when they have no way to defend themselves when you start to think critically youll see that america isnt as much of a police state as you believe people arent dragged from their homes in the middle of the night for negative connotation towards their leaders like cuba or communist russia or china they dont have trackers implanted in your body so if you escape they can track wherever you are in the world like they do in north korea you can speculate that oh they do with facebook and twitter and instagram and your internet history but thats where your fallacy comes into play those are optional things in your life you dont need your iphone or computers honestly having these things is sort of doing a disservice to the poor and homeless in this country why not sell your electronic devices and spread the wealth among the homeless and downtrodden why not open your doors to homeless people and have them live in your home with you
socialism,removed,trump farright bahahahaha hes one of the least conservative candidates in the republican party to run for office authoritarian ahahahahaha this shit is hilarious we are joking right
socialism,removed,nazism is socialism in many ways they dont accept the international worker class but a nationalist class for the rest they accept most of the socialist ideas even the name the original socialist party is the sdap and the nazi nsdap musssolini was an active socialist militant in italy
socialism,removed,basically an uncaring middle class acting higher than their actual station assuming higher class morals with a middle class lifestyle eager to look down on others less fortunate
socialism,removed,that is not what bourgeoise means trump is not middle class bourgeoise is a term reserved for middle class acting high class while looking down on the lower class
socialism,removed,if given the opportunity to design your perfect socialist utopian society how would you go about creating it
socialism,removed,i am certain that people of equal talent have died at concentration camps created and run by the national socialist german workers party
socialism,removed,yeahthe degree to which this is shopped doesnt add anything that isnt true
socialism,removed,funny how the first thing socialistcommunist governments tend to do is kill the intellectuals
socialism,removed,this is neither edgy nor is it a logically valid argument
socialism,removed,no they havent
socialism,removed,the party and the great leader decide
socialism,removed,some might disagree ¯ツ¯
socialism,removed,im an older model what can i say ¯ツ¯
socialism,removed,so lets put everyone in sweatshops and poverty good job 👏🏻
socialism,removed,we should just give all the poor people free money because they might be the next einstein poor person
socialism,removed,how many gifted people died under lenin and the subsequent gulags under stalin maos cultural revolution purge or pol pots murderous regime and famine
socialism,removed,that one does not seem that bad could certainly be stated better but not knowing the context it seems more like something i would attribute to ignorance rather than racism
socialism,removed,lol how many folks here are blocked by arthur
socialism,removed,all of these problems arent the fault of capitalism theyre failures of governemnt it is the existence of a state that grew to a size and legitimacy in which it could determine winners in the market and print fiat currency that alters the market so that commodities are available but the individual lacks the purchasing power from exploitative fiat real capitalism does not have a state monopolized currency funny im from a voluntarist worldview but i dont see why we blame each other instead of fighting mutually against the state so that we can segregate and live voluntary lifestyles with people who we want to organize society with
socialism,removed,how is it racist to ask where a person is from
socialism,removed,so the solution would be to steal from others
socialism,removed,in europe and north america white people would probably be asked this a lot in africa asia or latin america is it bad to be curious about ones background im sure most people dont ask the question with racist intentions
socialism,removed,yeah fuck the theory of relativity because some people are poor
socialism,removed,okay so then how would you go about freeing the people of their capitalist ways how would you do it
socialism,removed,because libertarians look at this fancy chart and laugh there is nothing on it that has anything to do with capitalism
socialism,removed,what do empty homes have to do with capitalism capitalism allowed those homes to exist its not capitalisms fault those homes arent in the locations that homeless people live you know in the cities where they get free food from food shelves and dumpsters and can panhandle more successfully wealth inequity in congress is due to lobbying and government fascism not capitalism people are getting poorer well maybe we should give them opportunities to work their way out of it instead of allowing them to go into debt on majors that offer few or no jobs imposing rules and regulations that put businesses that could hire them out of business and allowing crony capitalism and corporatism to continue ruining america workers produce more than ever because they have a plethora of technology and years of efficiency built into their jobs to help them do it this doesnt mean they are underpaid wall street got rich by investing which leads to more jobs so they in fact helped fight poverty our prison state is caused by incredible bad drug laws not capitalism capitalism is responsible in part for private prisons which are indeed bad things but the number of people in prison are the governments fault not capitalism minority groups commit more crimes and are actually statistically underrepresented in prison they dont commit these crimes because of the color of their skin but the circumstances their communities find themselves in legalizing drugs and allowing capitalism to flourish would actually greatly help the crime issue disappear thanks for the chart showing how grossly wrong government spending is though this i can agree on
socialism,removed,workers dont produce more than ever automation produces more than ever
socialism,removed,using my shadow account so i could reply you guys have to purge dissenters instead of facing a debate jesus christ afraid of the marketplace of ideas too capitalism necessitates these classes wanna explain how castro died with a net worth of million while average cubans live on a dole of a month if you want to fight the exploitation that exists under the state i dont see why you dont join us in fighting its root cause capitalism and class society if you in any way see my liberty as your oppression you are my mortal enemy coercion and undue violence is what causes evil in the world not freedom to exchange goods in a voluntary manner
socialism,removed,yeah i bet venezuela feels free and unoppressed as shit right now
socialism,removed,because socialist countries like the ussr north korea and cuba were so much more prosperous than western capitalist economies we could do an experiment take an advanced country like say germany split it in half make one half socialist the other capitalist and see which people are more prosperous in years i wonder how that would turn out
socialism,removed,theres other kinds of socialism then the soviet brand and none of them work either capitalism countries actively trying to destroy marxist leninist ones isent helping your point either this statement is just silly nonsense capitalist nations did nothing to undermine socialism it failed on its own merits
socialism,removed,this is just delusional the world left the soviets alone except for when they were being expansionist
socialism,removed,horseshit capitalism is no more racist than any other power structure
socialism,removed,or starving right now in socialist venezuela not real socialism
socialism,removed,the quote is horseshit because capitalism doesnt care what race you are never has the people who got richest off the slave trade were black slave traders anarchism is for fools great in principle but doesnt work with the humanity we have only spherical humans in a vacuum
socialism,removed,i dont understand this kind of revolutionary rhetoric tea party did the same thing around both them and us are guilty of being like revolution the people in power shall be overthrown tyranny ends now but im guessing not more than tea partiers and nor socialists of this sub are actually down to purchase weapons and start killing us police army which is what it would take for an actual revolution to take hold this shit just seems silly to me we should be focusing on campaigns for single payer health care universal basic income retaining medicare and medicaid raising the minimum wage and other realistic practical ideas than just sharing feel good yet meaningless revolutionist images
socialism,removed,you are so absurdly juvenile in your mindset with this star warsharry potter blackwhite morality complex maybe just maybe most leaders arent evil or looking purely out of selfinterest but have a collectivist empathy and responsibility or even gasp a christlike agape for their subjects just a guess though you wimpering fedoralord
socialism,removed,the largest genocides in human history have been under communist and socialist regimes this sub is hilarious
socialism,removed,i spent minutes reading a summary of one of chomskys dozens of books and i can confidently say that he is a shallow thinker thats how stupid you sound
socialism,removed,i think blaming people having sex for environmental problems and other issues surrounding population growth is antisocialist there are two points i want to make about this statement sex is not the same as reproduction we have contraception and artificial insemination abortion and ivf sex is done for pleasure and bonding reproduction for the perceived need to perpetuate environment is only one argument used by antinatalists and not a very common one at that definitely not the issue that concerns me the most if at all at least especially when we already have the technology and strategy to shrink the population peacefully and consentually lol the only way the population is going to shrink is by famine pestilence etc we may have the technology but do we have the will what strategy is there and how will people realistically be persuaded to follow it with beneficial results especially in cultures that encourage breeding socialism is great but whats the need to bring more people in to the world to hopefully one day be able to experience it reproduction is the creation of a new brain which as far as we know is where our sentience comes from thus with out that brain existing there is no need to experience life and no deprivation from its pleasures nor pains they simply dont exist sure creating a new being allows them to experience pleasures but thats like telling a romcom enthusiast that they are missing out on the next scifi it doesnt make a difference to them there wouldnt otherwise be a brain to add to that they are now exposed to the harms as well all of this when the capacity for this never needed to exist in the first place having children so they may achieve socialism is like putting perfectly good food in the dumpster so that the scavengers may get the good food and thats a better analogy than it deserves
socialism,not_removed,it is a bureaucratic institution specifically designed to suppress communism and promote neoliberalism
socialism,not_removed,have a read of these op they sum it up better than i could
socialism,not_removed,socialists hated it from the start it was originally designed by moderate rightwing politicians as a way to end the possibility of a war in europe by making impossible for the member nations to nationalize coal and steel production it was seen as a an antisoviet alliance and every communist parties of western europe opposed it socialists like me do approve some of it like the idea internationalism and open boarder associated with it but the fact is that the eu does not have the power to create a socialist state but take just enough power from its member states to stop them from ever becoming socialist it has also become a hub of lobbyists and corporate donors that promote free trade deals for their own interests at the expense of eu citizens antirevisionists feel it is also breaching in the sovereignty of nationstates and do not like its political system as a liberal democracy
socialism,not_removed,i think their treatment of ireland greece portugal and spain are big ones
socialism,not_removed,on a related note what do socialists think of the brexit
socialism,not_removed,can you try to explain to me how they do this
socialism,not_removed,its cool but it was pushed mainly by xenophobic convictions and thats not cool
socialism,not_removed,almost always under the guise of social democracy they socialize healthcare and education and give people a false sense of security by design the eu is a corporatist procapitalist establishment the nordic model from scandinavia the polder model from the netherlands the rhine model in switzerland and the benelux countries etc all have a basis on corporatism and corporatism is often seen as a bedrock for fascism even stalin considered social democracy a form of social fascism
socialism,not_removed,first you said the eu promotes neoliberalism then you say it promotes social democracy and corporatism which is it
socialism,not_removed,im very confused by your definition of corporatism america is the closest country to a real life example of corporatism the nordic countries are regularly ranked as some of the least corrupt countries in the world and have strong foundations on socialist policies bernie sanders campaign was run on importing the socialist policies of the nordics and bringing in social democracy from there
socialism,not_removed,you already posted this days ago
socialism,not_removed,million dollar political contributions free speech strident attacks against minorities free speech criticizing the government treason
socialism,not_removed,actually i have a friend from the us who moved to europe who has been wanting to give up her us citizenship however this would cost her like bucks so if he pushes this through we could just buy some cheap made in china american flag burn it in the yard and save a lot of money d
socialism,not_removed,the presidentelect making these types of proposals on several occasions should frighten everyone even if he doesnt really mean it his rhetoric is authoritarian and nationalistic well have to wait and see if his policies will reflect that
socialism,not_removed,in the we go to war to stop fascists today we elect one well done america so many people on the right talk about how they value liberties and then see stuff like this and go oh thats ok thats a good idea because the liberties they care about are their own if it doesnt directly affect them they dont care its a symptom of the same problem that got trump elected
socialism,not_removed,usa the land of free speech except when its against us
socialism,not_removed,holy shit its a piece of cloth
socialism,not_removed,by the way if you see any liberals getting upset by this remind them that hillary clinton proposed a bill doing the same thing in
socialism,not_removed,that makes me quite happy it means those capitalist pigs are afraid of protests and destruction of burgeoisie symbols
socialism,not_removed,antiestablishment
socialism,not_removed,oh the irony that this man was the antipc candidate
socialism,not_removed,patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel
socialism,not_removed,do you think another country will give me citizenship as a political dissident if i burned a flag asking for a friend
socialism,not_removed,mitch mcconnell on flag burning people like that pose little harm to our country but tinkering with our first amendment might
socialism,not_removed,haha does my friend get a penalty for pissing on it afterward
socialism,not_removed,he wont really do that hes just speaking his mind as a patriot liberals
socialism,not_removed,the mental gymnastics performed by trump supporters in breibarts comments section is truly amazing now please excuse me while i go take an advil for the headache that reading those comments caused
socialism,not_removed,you will adhere to our nationalist rhetoric or risk loss of human rights thats how you do freedom all right
socialism,not_removed,i wonder what he thinks the punishment for burning the confederate flag should be shot dead
socialism,not_removed,this bullshit is smoke and mirrors to distract us from his fascist tendencies period hes doing what bush did but even more make people think youre an idiot while you
socialism,not_removed,fascism level actually fucking worried
socialism,not_removed,i have a question for comrades outside of the us is there this type of flag fetishism in other countries from what i understand there are few or no other countries that have a pledge of alliance like we do in the us
socialism,not_removed,brb buying a flag
socialism,not_removed,im already sick of this manchild and he hasnt even been sworn in yet fuck you i think there should be a mass flagburning across the country to illustrate this point let the nationalism police come engage in civil disobedience
socialism,not_removed,this election is a referendum on political correctness
socialism,not_removed,inauguration day flag burning anybody
socialism,not_removed,isnt there a ussc case that protects flagburning as a form of speech
socialism,not_removed,wow this is basically the nationalists saying join us or die
socialism,not_removed,but i thought that republicans are for my personal freedom that the left wants to take away s
socialism,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpsantrnebgg
socialism,not_removed,i really hope all the gop senators stand in the chamber and wave little confederate flags while they vote this law in
socialism,not_removed,just a hypothetical scenario if burning a flag was made illegal does it need to be the exact american flag what if we made one with only stripes or stars etc and burned that instead how would this be proven in a court of law that the american flag and not a similar unamerican flag was being burned it seems impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the real thing was what was actually being burned leading to a situation where it would be illegal to burn something resembling a flag and for that matter what if i burned an american apparel tshirt with a depiction of the flag on it slippery slope here we come
socialism,not_removed,its that easy to disassociate yourself from the bloodthirsty empire
socialism,not_removed,well its a good thing that donald trump doesnt get to decide what happens to people who express themselves in ways he doesnt care for lets agree to do our best to keep it that way
socialism,not_removed,dont be distracted this is a way to divert attention from people investigating his financial conflicts of interest
socialism,not_removed,not surprising my first reaction to the election results was to burn an american flag but then i realised that meant id actually have to buy one
socialism,not_removed,slippery slope when you talk about citizenship as something so easily revoked
socialism,not_removed,this is what people like trump fail to grasp about the first amendment freedom of expression clause its sole purpose is to stop the government from censoring or punishing expressions that it considers offensive there is no need to protect expressions that are not generally offensive because no one will try to censor those in other words the first amendment is the antithesis of people can express themselves but theres a line of taste that they should respect and the government should stop people from saying really outrageous things
socialism,not_removed,texas v johnson perhaps donald should google things once in a while httpsenwikipediaorgwikitexasvjohnson
socialism,not_removed,donald trump continues to find new lows amongst even the lowest of fascist americans
socialism,not_removed,fuck that this country has freedom of speech not most speech all of it i dont care who it offends how people react or what people think about it but the government cannot step in on something like this punishing people for freedom of speech is one of the scariest things a leader can do
socialism,not_removed,except if you prefer the csa flag then thats fine
socialism,not_removed,httpscoutingwireorgeverythingascoutshouldknowaboutusflagretirement
socialism,not_removed,distract and conquer
socialism,not_removed,anyone who conspires with russia while running a presidential campaign deserves to be in jail
socialism,not_removed,yes the american slavery complex never has enough workers
socialism,not_removed,looks like theres a sales opportunity there someone needs to get right onto printing flammable flags with trumps face on it
socialism,not_removed,j u s t a p i e c e o f c l o t h s o n
socialism,not_removed,makes sense in a nation that simultaneously treats exposing crimes by the government against the american people and even people living in other countries as high treason meanwhile is trying to gain unlimited access to every small detail of its private citizens lives and communication
socialism,not_removed,this is the guy who said castro revoked peoples rights
socialism,not_removed,the idea that money free speech immediately breaks down any constitutional notion that its an inalienable right if money is free speech then speech is a privilege enjoyed by a small few
socialism,not_removed,im wondering what the benefit is of giving up ones citizenship just curious
socialism,not_removed,that was my first thought revoke citizenship get me a flag and a plane ticket i want to gtfo of america so bad
socialism,not_removed,i find the worse part is that his supporters is doing the most ridicilous mental gymnastics to defend and agree with him
socialism,not_removed,it just goes to show that just speaking your mind without thinking first isnt behavior we should want from our leaders trump is just so utterly careless
socialism,not_removed,it should also be noted that clinton proposed a law to prohibit burning the american flag in
socialism,not_removed,its pretty incredible honestly my grandparents are very conservative and supported trump from day one and they see nothing wrong with his rhetoric yet theyre all about freedoms and liberty sounds horrifically like attitudes in germany
socialism,not_removed,in the we go to war to stop fascists today we elect one my grandma was born the year hitler rose to power she died the year trump did part of me is glad she was spared seeing her own country vote for the things her generation fought and died to stop
socialism,not_removed,in the we go to war to stop fascists today we elect one well done america not as inconsistent as it looks us involvement in europe during was mostly to stop the ussr not germany taking over the continent
socialism,not_removed,i feel like i am making an understatement when i suggest that you not hold your breath in waiting for him to do that
socialism,not_removed,i think he does it in large part to put up flak tbh when all we cover is his insane tweets he can make as many backroom deals with indian oligarchs as he likes
socialism,not_removed,theres this punk song it goes something to the tune of america stands for freedom but if you think youre free try walking into a deli
socialism,not_removed,and of course the page is defaced to read shillary clinton
socialism,not_removed,what is the point the election is over if liberals are upset by this thats a good thing we should be finding whatever common ground we can in the fight against the growing fascist movement in america rubbing hillary clintons now irrelevant past agenda in someones face is totally counter productive and plays into trumps hands hell need us divided to against each other in order to dismantle whats left of our democracy and solidify power as an aside what you say isnt even true clinton didnt propose the revocation of citizenship and thats a very big difference becoming a noncitizen in trumps america is tantamount to becoming a nonperson youd have no rights youd be treated as a terrorist by default and hes already moving to treat protesters this way forget about hillary clinton shes done the only question now is whether america goes fully over to fascism or not
socialism,not_removed,two years after she voted to invade and destroy iraq fucking noice suck it liberals congratulations you fucking played yourself
socialism,not_removed,hilliary has been fairly centrist to left on social issues until very recently you cant compare a historical centrist to trump then say we cant disapprove trump because that centrist now is questionably liberal now burning the flag is an act of speech period
socialism,not_removed,what you cant be outraged by a doing x because b tried to do x first and you supported b sounds like a tu quoque fallacy
socialism,not_removed,but the penalty wasnt the government stripping your citizenship this is kind of a big deal not likely to happen because you need an amendment but still it signals the unique danger trump presents hillary proposed a fine up to
socialism,not_removed,and you know what they are both wrong but if you read the fine print hrc didnt want the law to restrict your amendment rights it was going to be illegal to burn someone elses flag or burn a flag to incite violence that was added in committee later then she voted against the changed version of the law cheeto benito wants to straight up violate the amendment fuck i cant believe im having to defend that piece of shit because trump is apparently the best shitstirrer in the usa damn near everyone else is a sucker
socialism,not_removed,this right here any lib cries about it make sure you show this
socialism,not_removed,thats the thing though burning a flag is just a form of free speech of nonviolent political protest the capitalist pigs arent afraid of it because they know its just a form of free speech and does very little to actually challenge the bourgeois hegemony trump is only saying things like this to motivate and galvanize his nationalist goons actual direct action will be discouraged as it always has been and always will be by the imperialist state brutal monopoly on political violence
socialism,not_removed,because they value liberty right
socialism,not_removed,times like this you just keep hoping that republicans in congress believe at least some of the freedom and liberty rhetoric theyve been shovelling for years
socialism,not_removed,you say penalty i say bonus points
socialism,not_removed,liberals look at the crazy things he says on twitter has already forgotten his white nationalist appointments
socialism,not_removed,neither hes playing chess again and controlling the media cycle while distracting away from the other things hes doing he was referencing clintons proposal for an antiflag burning law while at the same time getting liberals to burn american flags
socialism,not_removed,why would you punch yourself in the dick like that
socialism,not_removed,his supporters feel that and will say it openly in internet comments just like they think muslims poor people teh gays etc should be eliminated in so many ineloquent words i take that for a lot more than talking to your conservative grandpa or stepbrother about it over thanksgiving in terms of sincerity
socialism,not_removed,its treason to burn a flag that symbolizes treason
socialism,not_removed,i agree he exploits the habitual tendency of others to underestimate him and encourages it through outrageous public behavior but id also caution against dismissing a statement like this as merely a distraction what im saying is that proposing to revoke the civil rights of peaceful protesters which is what this amounts to is part and parcel to his fascist tendencies the timing is of course also opportune but hes working more than one angle here
socialism,not_removed,not here in new zealand the only pledge we have is when a new prime minister takes office and pledges loyalty to the queen of england as per tradition we also only sing the national anthem at international rugby and cricket matches and the only place youll see our national flag is when its flying over the parliament building
socialism,not_removed,im confident that something like a mass flag burning would be trumps dream come true it would serve to reinforce his claim which his supporters believe that antitrump protesters are really just antiamerican its bait dont take it
socialism,not_removed,please no hes baiting you instead we should bring an insane number of flags to the protests and get ridiculously decked out in red white and blue throw a wrench in trumps narrative that protesters and dissenters hate america instead of playing right into it make no mistake this is a provocation he wants us to burn flags lets not give him what he wants
socialism,not_removed,yes one in stated that flagburning is a part of free speech per the first amendment
socialism,not_removed,there is but the goal of a law like this would be to frame cases of flag burning to be more like inciting violence and riots as opposed criticism of the country
socialism,not_removed,there are limits to our liberty at least i hope and pray that there are cuz those liberal freaks go too far
socialism,not_removed,i hope they turn out to have at least one sincere bone in their body and oppose him on it not holding my breath though
socialism,not_removed,lo que es ableist
socialism,not_removed,you cant legally say i am going to kill the president as a standalone sentence
socialism,not_removed,while true its a bit different even though they both use fire for starters its approved since the unenforceable flag code covers it
socialism,not_removed,ill try to answer your questions to the best of my abilities however this isnt a sub for questions about socialismcommunism the subs for that are and although i prefer the former ok here goes its important to realize why were saying cuba isnt communist and why we endorse it and socialism socialism is when the means of production slightly complicated term you can google it are owned socially although there are disagreements among socialists whether or not cuba was socialist i think we all agree that cuba were working towards socialism socialism has one primarily rival capitalism private ownership of the means of production the us staunchly opposed socialism due to its reliance and backing of capitalists obviously the us would do anything to hinder socialism to grow close to its borders which has been apparent after decades of american intervention in central and south america the cuban revolution was a revolution against the fascist regime of batista an american backed government many relatively speaking refugees fled cuba following the revolution important to question why they fled most cuban refugees at that time were batistasupporters supporters of a capitalist fascist regime not the kind of people youd want to root for and it makes sense why these would celebrate his death and call him a dictator due to the uss opposition to socialism it makes sense the fascist refugees would get a platform and be the ones to decide what the cuban narrative should be in the western world this is the main reason fidel is considered evil and why we oppose a lot of the criticism of him personally i like him for i believe he has proven himself as a good revolutionary and good socialist leader and cast aside and admitted his mistakes like the homosexual persecution during the early years of modern cuba that said ive never been there but heard from friends who have and from variour other sources that the cuban people liked fidel and opposed the cubanamerican narrative if youd like to discuss more i wouldnt mind a personal conversation in personal messages away from the public eye of disapproval or if you dont mind that you would be welcome to post questions in the subreddits mentioned earlier long post is long also upvoted for the genuine question
socialism,not_removed,httpsyoutubenpkeeccerqc
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,whats your proof that fidel would exile someone for burning a flag also its not like the us and cuba are in the same position of vulnerability
socialism,not_removed,there is nobody on planet earth whose every action is something you agree with castro is respected because of his pissing in the face of american imperialism for decades and for improving the wellbeing of his countrymen despite an embargo and a mono crop economy we still look down on his censorship and jailing of political dissidents but the country thats always claiming the highest ideals the most freedoms the best everything its usually the one violating human rights on ridiculous scales and feasting on hypocrisy
socialism,not_removed,people in cuba have far more rights than a us citizen
socialism,not_removed,um didnt castro send gay cuban citizens to jail for no reason other than being gay edit yikes this was a legit question and not concern trolling ill make sure to answer my questions on my own next time
socialism,not_removed,speech is enjoyed by few
socialism,not_removed,clinton wanted to jail flag burners for a year
socialism,not_removed,who said it would be different under clinton no one here likes clinton
socialism,not_removed,nationalism is a disease that aside flag burning isnt necessarily anticountry and its a mistake to jump to that conclusion
socialism,not_removed,you can be patriotic and support your country sure if you are a fucking fascist
socialism,not_removed,not accurate at all
socialism,not_removed,symbolic you no longer have to pay federal taxes not sure if theres other reasons however im sure there are edit depending on the country some also require you to renounce your prior citizenships to immigrate and become a citizen
socialism,not_removed,some countries do not allow dual nationality and so renunciation of prior citizenship is part of the naturalisation process there this is probably the most common reason the usa perhaps uniquely attempts to charge income tax on nonresident citizens regardless of which country that income was earned in ignoring this could conceivably lead to being arrested over unpaid taxes if you ever visit the usa in countries that do allow dual nationality some types of security clearance may not be available to people who hold foreign citizenship this doesnt affect most people but can limit certain careers many countries demand compulsory military service from their citizens regardless of residence i believe the usa requires them to register for the draft
socialism,not_removed,after the election she just doesnt want to associate with the us anymore
socialism,not_removed,the trick is that you dont get a plane ticket somewhere else instead youre stuck in america without any rights this is going to be a trend trump like many up and coming dictators before him is going to characterize all his political opponents and dissenters as terrorists or otherwise undeserving of civil rights protections it will take a large and bold mass resistance movement to stop him
socialism,not_removed,time to swim for cuba
socialism,not_removed,hes for the working man hes draining the swamp uh his cabinet is worth billion so far and hes openly abusing the office for profit hes not a politician
socialism,not_removed,they identify with him and trust him implicitly this is something trump has worked hard to cultivate its no accident hes built up a very scary personality cult and thats what were up against
socialism,not_removed,trump has said so many outlandish things its easy to get desensitized by all of it hes set the bar so low for what we can expect him to say that nothing surprises me anymore i hope the liberals are right about it just being rhetoric
socialism,not_removed,ive heard it said before that equality is oppression to the privileged this is a case of something like that
socialism,not_removed,my grandfather told me that trump reminded him of mussolini he still voted for him because he thought clinton was worse
socialism,not_removed,trump will never go down a nazi style route the one thing that should comfort americans and even the world is the fact taht trump is a business man majority of decisions he will make will be to inflict positive economic growth for his businesses this will come about in lots of different ways one of which is he generally wont want to rock the boat too much what has happened in america the past odd years is good for him i highly doubt he will want to change that also add to this the fact that america already has a lot of similarities to the nazisussr obviously they arent slaughtering jews but other lines of policies are similar just not so in your face
socialism,not_removed,a capitalist pig called you that
socialism,not_removed,i mean you technically are a fucking commie but all the better i say
socialism,not_removed,i mean i got called unamerican in my apush class when i was in highschool because my teacher wanted to blame ross perot for his canidate dole losing and i asked why he thought dole was entitled to third party votes i was called unamerican in response
socialism,not_removed,its on the top of thebenito right now
socialism,not_removed,thats because a few hours ago it was defaced to remove her name from it completly now its been corrected
socialism,not_removed,the world shill isnt bad enough to describe how evil she is
socialism,not_removed,its important to point out liberal hypocrisy i dont want to unite with liberals to defeat a potential fascist threat fuck popular front we need a united front of actual socialists and agitating liberals should continue to show that liberalism is a shallow and dangerous ideology itself
socialism,not_removed,the irony of a president who cheated on his wife enforcing the sanctity of marriage
socialism,not_removed,thats not the argument the argument is if a doing x makes you outraged then b doing x should also make you outraged if not then x isnt really what mattered to you
socialism,not_removed,you need an amendment all im going to say is that fascists dont usually bother modifying or replacing constitutions they just start ignoring them until one day theyd meaningless documents we shouldnt kid ourselves that the constitution can save us
socialism,not_removed,which is still pretty ridiculous and unfairly punishes those with less money
socialism,not_removed,i´m not dumb to think that burning a flag is a real impact on the capialist pigs but it surely represents a important critic to the crazy nationalism and represent dissident movements also it´s good enough he brings this kind of thing to the attention of the masses
socialism,not_removed,he said pussy
socialism,not_removed,source on his white nationalist appointments i dont doubt it but are these david duke selfidentified white nationalist types or mike pence more cryptofascist types i dont really make much of a distinction but it could be a point of radicalization for liberals if they see he is appointing people who identify as racist in addition to being racist
socialism,not_removed,we use that term to also refer to conservatives
socialism,not_removed,hes definitely planting the seeds for super draconian antiprotest laws hes admiration of putin is genuine and he wants to be able to crush dissent the way putin does start talking about it now and it will be less shocking when more concrete measures start happening once hes in office
socialism,not_removed,regarding why i read the comments section on breitbart i was boredand will never make that mistake again
socialism,not_removed,besides the flag colours are the main symbol of the protofascist movement responsible for dilmas impeachment this is really interesting to hear what do you think the real reason was for dilmas impeachment im not critical or anything im just asking out of curiosity to me it seemed like her impeachment had a misogynistic streak to it
socialism,not_removed,that antitrump protesters are really just antiamerican i wish
socialism,not_removed,we do hate america though
socialism,not_removed,the supreme court also has clear precedent regarding the definition of incitement with respect to acts of speech revoking citizenship as punishment for a crime is also blatantly unconstitutional theyd need a constitutional amendment to make this proposal legal that is of course assuming that trumps administration winds up being meaningfully bound by the constitution and that he doesnt get a chance to pack the supreme court
socialism,not_removed,it all depends on how it impacts them in their own races expect people in deeply red districts to be with him until the bitter end andor until he completely goes over the ideological edge and even then and then for people in more centrist states or with tighter constituencies to duck out of supporting him ifwhen he does shit like pushing an antiflag burning amendment its all about selfinterest and nothing else very very few people in dc care about the people theyre serving in any real way i mean and the sky is blue too
socialism,not_removed,discrimination against disabled people
socialism,not_removed,true but that is speech that threatens others i should have said no limit on speech that doesnt unjustly put others at risk
socialism,not_removed,i know i was hoping to draw attention to the dangers of swiping statements
socialism,not_removed,the only time ive seen that scene and not felt the feels
socialism,not_removed,speak for yourself near every political dissident he jailed deserved what they got
socialism,not_removed,high american infant mortality rate freedom
socialism,not_removed,yo im as antitrump and anticap as the next guy but speaking as someone whos been to cuba more than once this is absolutely not true
socialism,not_removed,im talking about trump
socialism,not_removed,much more complicated than that im on mobile so its hard for me to link but the askhistorians megatread about castro had a good explanation of the camps and how they functioned as well as castros response to realizing how bad conditions were within the camps
socialism,not_removed,um does that make trump not a hypocrite as glossedover as your statement is to quote lenin let us assume that he has overcome unprecedented difficulties and dangers and has succeeded in reaching a much higher point than any of his predecessors but still has not reached the summit he finds himself in a position where it is not only difficult and dangerous to proceed in the direction and along the path he has chosen but positively impossible communism is something to be perfected just like capitalism is dynamic castro isnt the perfection of it by any means but he made many steps in the correct direction one of the privileges of out american system is that america itself constantly gets to benefit of the atrocities of the past with the luxury of blaming the guy before you at least thats what the masses allow but we all know trump is the personification of perfection right just follow him on twitter and find out
socialism,not_removed,yeah i honestly dont get the point of whining about clinton at this point on a socialist forum shes irrelevant now
socialism,not_removed,the usa perhaps uniquely attempts to charge income tax on nonresident citizens regardless of which country that income was earned in whoooa fckin socialists s
socialism,not_removed,its been a while since i checked but iirc you still have to file when living abroad but im pretty sure there is a decently high threshold before you actually have to pay taxes to the usa while living abroad not saying its a good or bad thing just mentioning it
socialism,not_removed,as long as no one forces me to stay i can work with that im an uber away from tijuana characterize all his political opponents and dissenters as terrorists pretty much what much of our government has already done in recent past with groups like occupy and blm in case it isnt clear i agree with you
socialism,not_removed,with guns and organized peoples militias not with witty liberal critiques and political revolutions
socialism,not_removed,rafts are the way to go i heard
socialism,not_removed,no need im miles from tijuana
socialism,not_removed,uh his cabinet is worth billion so far and hes openly abusing the office for profit source i can throw at some fashes
socialism,not_removed,i dont think trump believes a damn thing that comes out of his mouth but his supporters do and that is the real problem trump is creating an environment in which that sort of bullshit is acceptable this leads to a normalization of far right rhetoric and racism which in turn will allow genuinely evil people to be more easily elected to high offices the end result is america becoming a true fascist state its not a pretty picture comrade
socialism,not_removed,i think trump will functionally be gwb an absentee president otoh he has been and will continue to be entirely tone deaf to his supporters and the opposition he has done and will continue to do damage to the country by energizing nationalist andor racist groups whether intentionally or not tweeterinchief as it were
socialism,not_removed,i havent really seen many liberals thinking trump is just spouting ridiculous rhetoric by and large theyre scared shitless because they think hes hitler and everything that is wrong with everything however from what ive seen they seem to think that because theyve been living in the democratic partys bubble for ages not because of any real critical thought on their own part so the more i critically examine trump the more it does seem like hes just opportunistically and cynically spouting off ridiculous rhetoric to gain support from right wingers and people desperate for something other than your usual insider politician it was a winning strategy who the hell knows what hell actually do as president
socialism,not_removed,well i pretty much agree with you as in i dont really think he is dumb and i think he is very manipulative but i do think intentional or not that he is careless tho he just really doesnt care about anything but himself so in that sense he is willing to take this road without caring about the future consequences for the rest of the countryworld and who gets hurt in the process and thats what i meant by careless even if we were really to believe that he is just speaking off the cuff than that still wouldnt be positive of course
socialism,not_removed,haha yeah i corrected it p
socialism,not_removed,do we really have the numbers to be shunning a popular front
socialism,not_removed,because he killed rosa luxembourg
socialism,not_removed,both make me outrage and theyre both little more than gestures on trumps part probably to troll protestors into burning more flags and looking bad in the eyes of the public on hillarys probably a gesture to look patriotic and win the support of more jingoists which clearly didnt work
socialism,not_removed,i still read this as a tu quoqueappeal to hypocrisy
socialism,not_removed,no worries comrade i dont think youre dumb at all i apologize if my reply conveyed that i respect your perspective and i agree that it represents a valuable critique obviously certain folks are very emotionally attached to national flags im just willing to bet that trump doesnt give a shit about the flag he never lost a leg in an imperialist war but he is popular among nationalists and he knows the flag is the cheapest way to appeal to jingoism ☭
socialism,not_removed,bannon is an open white supremacist
socialism,not_removed,bannon sessions
socialism,not_removed,im with you on this one i dont feel like playing games it would only fuel more propagandist rhetoric denouncing the left if we try to aim for irony
socialism,not_removed,but we could certainty argue that we stand for the ideals upon which america was founded upon we could totally coopt liberty and justice for all
socialism,not_removed,pick your battles comrade all im going to say
socialism,not_removed,the districts and to a lesser extent the states have become so polarized now though how many republicans actually come from places where they have to worry about a democratic challenger
socialism,not_removed,whats your take on free speech zones and obscenity i should probably point out that im australian so i dont really have a dog in the fight of first ammendment interpretation
socialism,not_removed,i agree with that harmful speech like racism and sexism shouldnt be accepted and theres nothing wrong with punishing it
socialism,not_removed,got proof of that statement
socialism,not_removed,living in constant fear of losing your job getting injured being shot at a theater freedom
socialism,not_removed,except if they think you aborted your child
socialism,not_removed,hes referring to economic freedom
socialism,not_removed,thanks i looked into it its very informative
socialism,not_removed,i wasnt arguing that pence isnt a hypocrite nor that trump is perfect nobody is i actually have a lot of respect for castro and agree that he was a great leader for the people of cuba
socialism,not_removed,that awkward moment when u try to imply that a poc is racist also its good and important to look at and participate in debates where you are exposed to different perspectives in a democracy used to be you asked a question and got answers instead of insults
socialism,not_removed,fascist useful idiot blind sheep all apply
socialism,not_removed,if you dont hate a fascist country if you support it and wave its flag and call yourself patriotic yeah you are probably a fascist the whole if it looks like a duck kinda thing going on
socialism,not_removed,foreign income tax exclusion is like i think
socialism,not_removed,nobody would force you to stay but good luck getting into any country with no valid passport
socialism,not_removed,i dont think guns and peoples militias are likely to accomplish anything other than making it easier for trump to label all of us terrorists and then justify the expansion of his power to restore law and order if you can present an even remotely plausible case to the contrary im all ears otherwise we just need to fill the streets organize strike and resist wherever we can without playing into trumps hands
socialism,not_removed,a great exodus of comrades to cuba sounds like a great plan really
socialism,not_removed,genuine question if i show up in havana in a boat asking for asylum is there a chance i would love to study there
socialism,not_removed,many of the individuals cited are still speculation of course but devos is a forsure pick and romney looks likely
socialism,not_removed,this is really the issue its not just the shit he says or whether he actually believes it its that the people he surrounds himself with fills cabinet positions et cetera do believe this and theyre willing and able to push forth legislation for it
socialism,not_removed,im not entirely certain thats true trump strikes me as a very sensitive person with very little self worth he has a large ego obviously but he strikes me as someone who needs constant validation from others his replies to his critics are very telling in this regard he lashes out like a young child i think he frequently says what he believes thats not to say he has a really coherent and cogent worldview nor that what he believes is the product of serious rational thinking rather i think it is likely that his beliefs stem from his insecurities and need for constant validation as such they are subject to the whims of those he seeks approval and validation from as he gains power i think it likely his insecurities will only increase and with it probably also his backlash against his critics as the person who will be the figurehead of the us it makes sense to him that anyone burning a flag should be prosecuted in coming days burning the flag will be indistinguishable to him from an attack on his very person and the authority he wields as president i dont think trump is capable of handling that in any other way than by trying to force others to bend to his will through the force of the state children who are bullies are prime examples of this except that most of them have a tendency to learn some measure of self worth and they stop being bullies when they no longer need others to validate their beliefs and possibly even their very existence trump hasnt ever and may not be capable of honestly grown out of it i think its part of what makes him a very dangerous person
socialism,not_removed,honestly his supporters and potential cabinet members may be more batshit insane than he is
socialism,not_removed,whatever the reasons liberals think trump is a fascist dictator and everything that is wrong with everything they arent wrong hes just opportunistically and cynically spouting off ridiculous rhetoric to gain support from right wingers and people desperate for something other than your usual insider politician this is a pretty concise summary of how hitler and mussolini rose to power seriously its no exageration to say that trump has played directly from the nazi playbook minus the brownshirts turns out he may not have needed them or even his own party a massive surveillance state militarized police eroded constitutional order and complacent republican party may just granted him all the tools hell need to make the us his own putinesque pseudodemocracy effectively ending the american republic as we know it realistically only the people can stand in his way at this point well see
socialism,not_removed,complimented the bacon wants to see you as the cooked egg on his plate through remaining cool and uncracked and altogether accepting of your fucking commieness you only sizzle him that much more
socialism,not_removed,have you seen his interviews lately especially the one on democracy now today hes gone full capitalist democrat reform the party nonsense i hope people will see through the ineffectiveness of his socdem bullshit and go full communist
socialism,not_removed,the argument isnt that you cant be outraged the argument is thats its a mistake to support the other person also edit grammar
socialism,not_removed,no tu quoque would be more along the lines of if a doing x makes you outraged then b doing x should also make you morally outraged you arent outraged by b therefore x isnt wrong and well that isnt valid obviously even if someones a hypocrite they might actually be right but the point of this argument isnt actually to argue that x is good or bad its to argue that your opponent isnt actually bothered by x theyre bothered by something else
socialism,not_removed,i´m not that familiarized with american culture but from my point of view nationalism on the us never was a topic of debate glad it´s finally becoming due radical action you didn´t imply i was dumb or anything it was just my way of saying it slava comrade
socialism,not_removed,i just now read about bannons breitbart connection this shit is really bad i hope we can use this to agitate at the very least
socialism,not_removed,what exactly is a free speech zone
socialism,not_removed,and what makes flag burning any different from hate speech its offending a certain group of people and both claim freedom of speech as to why it should be tolerated
socialism,not_removed,it was for the stability of cuba of course
socialism,not_removed,i love cuba as much as the next guy put people do still get injured there luckily they have free healthcare if that happens
socialism,not_removed,then it might be even less true in the case of economic freedom listen im all for lauding the successes of the cuban revolution literacy infant mortality etc are all facets of the castro regime that should be displayed proudly by socialists but its disingenuous to neglect the castros shortcomings especially when it comes to human rights
socialism,not_removed,glad you found it useful i know that i had the same questions about the camps that you did for a real long time and even the leftist circles i spend time in irl were parroting the same sort of simplistic discussion of it that id heard in highschool and the like that megathread had been a real lifesaver since castros death in terms of dispelling the more commonunfounded rumors and about the downvotes i know that this sub has been pretty inundated with nonstop concern trolling throughout the past few months so people here are understandably wary of questions that sound like that might be what theyre doing hope you stick around though—its always nice to have more people interested in earnestly learning and discussing whats going on
socialism,not_removed,if minstrel shows for white people arent racist i dont know what is
socialism,not_removed,right sorry
socialism,not_removed,its fairly easy to get into certain parts of mexico without a passport im american i dont have a passport but i get in easily multiple times a year with no issues
socialism,not_removed,i can catch an uber and walk into mexico with no passport baja is pretty nice i have friends trying to talk me into moving down there already besides at that point i could maybe be considered a political refugee
socialism,not_removed,look at what happens with every recent protest when the people arent armed whats happening at the dakota access pipeline should be obvious enough theyre sicking the dogs on people spraying water when its freezing outside shooting tear gas canisters and jailing hundreds of people cops have nothing to fear from unarmed protesters they will brutalize us jail us and beat us until we are wiped out the only good capitalist is a scared one
socialism,not_removed,thats giving up though
socialism,not_removed,im glad i wasnt the only one thinking this so how do we get there when our rafts arrive will the cuban authorities take us or will we be suspected cia spies
socialism,not_removed,always a chance but im sure theyd just send you back
socialism,not_removed,exactly he is almost going to be a figurehead a puppet even the right wing is gonna get a lot of use out of their cardboard cutout billionaire
socialism,not_removed,you may be right comrade but the main danger of trump is his supporters is the normalization of he bullshit he spews he might believe it he might not either way his supporters do and that is scary
socialism,not_removed,trump strikes me as a very sensitive person with very little self worth he has a large ego obviously but he strikes me as someone who needs constant validation from others his replies to his critics are very telling in this regard he lashes out like a young child classic narcissist would have been much shorter
socialism,not_removed,i agree one hundred percent
socialism,not_removed,not really there are some big differences at least with hitler including that germany was much worse off economically there was a serious threat to the wealthy powers coming from the left and hitler actually believed the things that he said right now in america there is essentially no threat from the left whatsoever due to decades of relentless propaganda from the us government the average american citizen thinks like socialism and communism are the same thing socialism means having the government do it and communism is mass murdering authoritarian dictatorship weve seen the smallest inklings of a resurgence of the left with bernie sanders unexpectedly popular campaign but hes just moderateleft and he lost when theres an actual left wing movement in the united states again that really honestly seeks to start dismantling capitalism and taking power away from the wealthy elites the thing that fascism has historically been a response to and a strongman style politician comes on to the scene with the blessing of the capitalist class preaching nationalism authoritarianism a return to former glory and hate especially towards leftists andor scapegoated minorities and hes genuine about it then we have an honest to god hitler situation fortunately that does not describe the situation now as trumps election only meets one of these criteria and barely so hes been so inconsistent in what he says in that we cant really say anything about it for certain
socialism,not_removed,ive never been a bernie supporter but i knew it would happen
socialism,not_removed,i hope im not assuming too much concerning peoples nationalities but ive always felt this subreddit is quite markedly american precisely because of rhetoric like this i live in europe even though id say leftist parties here do quite much better than say the us completely hopping into the communist train still wouldntdoesnt work here its still reformist socialists that garner the largest support im not saying it is the best alternative but its still a fact in my home country there is a large social democrat party and a leftleaning green party that both gather much larger support than leftist alliance which i vote myself without exception mind you which isnt even communist just very leftist actual communist parties havent had parliamentary representatives in decades only way for the leftist alliance to achieve power is to ally with the more reformist parties the alternative is to become irrelevant of course this is realpolitik vs idealism in my experience digging trenches between socdems and communists just doesnt work it only divides the progressives in the fight against reactionaries of course this kind of rhetoric might work in the us because of the twoparty system im not an american so i cant talk too strongly about the system there this is just my own observation about the discussion in this subreddit offtopic this is also why i find the rule about not supporting the eu very strange i dont find fiscally conservative stranglehold policies of the eu satisfactory but i also think that eu is absolutely necessary structure to ensure the wellbeing of small european nations such as my homecountry
socialism,not_removed,i dont even know that its a mistake to support the other person just dont pretend they aint done bad shit too
socialism,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikifreespeechzone the existence of free speech zones is based on us court decisions stipulating that the government may regulate the time place and manner—but not content—of expression though admittedly this part needs citation so take it with a grain of salt
socialism,not_removed,its pretty easy for a random health event to ruin your life in the us
socialism,not_removed,sure power grows from the barrel of a gun and all that but nobody in switzerland fears being murdered in the streets like they are in the us despite the same kind of lax gun laws
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately the liberals have taken away my ability to get a gun as my type of people always get scapegoated for mass shootings
socialism,not_removed,a primary point of socialism is that the workers own and run the business that way the business operates for the benefit of the workers instead of paying the workers a wage the workers share in the profits of the business as is equal to them amount of work they put in being forced to work for a business who exploits your surplus labour is not freedom at all if you genuinely are serious about wanting discussion my advice is read some communistsocialist literature first then think whether or not you agree with its assertions the communist manifesto is a good starting point as it is fairly simple short and easy to read
socialism,not_removed,deleted
socialism,not_removed,my view is that nationalism is simply a tool used by the ruling class to divide humanity what makes you american your skin color nope whatever language you use nope your culture nope its all in our heads ideology the truth is you are not american you are simply a human being on a planet you share with every other human being thats the actual reality that nationalists are unable to see end of story
socialism,not_removed,because the country represents more than the government a countrys identity is based on its history which is filled to the brim with racism and imperialism its geography which the resident should feel no pride over and its political stances which you yourself disagrees with ive had the same internal struggle of leftwing opinions and patriotism and i came to the conclusion of casting aside any form of nationalism for the following reasons nationalism is the idea that you should to some degree be proud of being born in a place you never chose any form and im including even mild forms of nationalism all plays into the hands of the reactionaries and id like no part in that as humans on a single planet it is ridiculous to divide ourselves from imagined borders divided from one quarter of a landmass to another were all humans first and foremost and as humans we should all be internationalists
socialism,not_removed,im an expat in sweden and for me its foreign earned income exclusion
socialism,not_removed,but how does escalating the violence help us the state is much better at violence than we are i dont see any way that small arms and rag tag militias will scare the capitalists it will certainly make them feel more justified in ramping up the brutality of repression without offering us any plausible benefit but again im open to hearing good reasons to believe otherwise that said i certainly dont pretend that protest alone will suffice its one tactic among many it has its place but simply put were going to need to get creative
socialism,not_removed,oh leaving is just act one act two and three is our glorious returninvasion
socialism,not_removed,i dont really think this anymore his cabinet is white supremacists people who think that only property owners should be able to vote antisemites people who think climate scientists must be stopped his administration is very much going to be one that would have no problem being a part of a dictatorship
socialism,not_removed,absolutely agree i and im sure many others said numerous times before the election that his supporters scare me the most after all even if he hadnt been elected it wouldnt change the fact that so many voted for him and ardently supported him and those people aint goin nowhere
socialism,not_removed,i thought about it but ive heard too many people use the word narcissist to simply mean selfish it obviously applies correctly here though i agree
socialism,not_removed,the other difference is that the weimar constitution gave the presidents powers a lot of leeway in the us the system of checks and balances is strong the government is designed to allow a minority to obstruct it and to prevent one person from having total authority mitch mcconnell and kevin mccarthy have both denounced this statement thats the heads of both chambers of congress i have no faith theyll continue to do so but short of stripping the filibuster which nobody in the senate wants to do no bill like this could be passed not least because it defies supreme court precedent
socialism,not_removed,it is a mistake clinton lost not that she was going to do anything good for international workers anyway
socialism,not_removed,oh those absolute bullshit oh you want to protest thats fine but you can only do it in this cornered off area away from the actual event where youre out of site of the media
socialism,not_removed,but in both cases people are offended
socialism,not_removed,doesnt help that sandersistas were going around supporting sanders policy of not wanting to allow urban people to have guns because they have a violent culture and cannot be responsible gun owners
socialism,not_removed,my type of people are you white
socialism,not_removed,that just shows that the vast majority of the users are white and only go there to laugh at black people
socialism,not_removed,cool great to know thanks
socialism,not_removed,true but the lasting damage is social in my opinion
socialism,not_removed,id agree with you if the two party system wasnt so entrenched and we werent locked into a situation where not supporting one nominee is essentially the same as supporting the other
socialism,not_removed,what im saying arm yourself to the teeth but it would be nice to not be in fear of death at all times also im making the point that gun ownership and gun deaths arent necessarily related especially in the us where there seems to be some other factor which makes people want to shoot each other
socialism,not_removed,either im missing something or you are because switzerland has lax gun laws and lots of gun ownership i dont think the person above you is advocating for gun control
socialism,not_removed,they didnt say committed they said get scapegoated for my best guess is muslim
socialism,not_removed,except schools have to compete for government funding they have to prove that they deserve increased government funding by either increasing the number of students showing demand for the course or increasing the grades showing they use funding appropriately furthermore students are taught in a way that makes them valuable to the economy they arent taught because education and literacy are important they are taught so that they can be effective little subservient workers the american education system is such a good example of it if you want me to explain why im more than happy to
socialism,not_removed,this has always concerned me about our rhetoric so many socialists go on and on about the worker and the factory but what about schools and service jobs i fear that we alienate servicebased economies
socialism,not_removed,erm fam thats what im arguing is bad im not saying schools should be competing for government funding but in the us they are and in the uk they compete for funding full stop and by compete i mean with both other industries and other schools a communistsocialist view would put education as one of the most important aspects of life it would run a school in a way that would benefit the pupils to the maximum schools are supposedly run like that today if you ignore lack of funding schools are run for the best interests of pupils and the pupils best interests as far as capitalism sees them is for them to be productive producers for the bourgeois
socialism,not_removed,well you know communism and socialism and every communist and socialist thinker since hegel have been key socialist and marxist thinkers if you want modern day ones then just look at slavoj zizek one of the most published modern philosophers the space race was won by the ussr sputnik first dog in space etc people who know what youre talking about dont let him know the truth about the shit hes chatting
socialism,not_removed,it would be decided on a pupil by pupil basis

socialism,not_removed,i think the surplus value taken as profit is a great place to start show them the graph with productivity vs wages in the usa for the past years the divergence between them in the shows the concept really well imo
socialism,not_removed,these graphs might help this graph shows that since the the productivity of the average worker has basically doubled but the average real wage has actually fallen since then this graph shows that since the share of national income owned by the top of earners has skyrocketed while the share of income owned by the lowest quintiles the workers has fallen it seems to me that basically while workers are now producing far more value for their labour since the what they receive has actually dropped in roughly the same period the share of income for the top earners has skyrocketed workers arent rewarded more for producing more the opposite is true not sure how you would be able to prove it rewarding capital though but it might help you show how capitalism doesnt reward labour i will immediately defer to someone with greater knowledge on this than me though i might be reading the data wrong or failing to analyse it properly if so id be happy to learn
socialism,not_removed,i would think graphsstats that show what most predicts mobility is the resources you already have not how hard you work including incomewealth of the working poor and the nonworking rich
socialism,not_removed,starting a business or just buying some dividendproducing shares gets you money forever even if you later just become a stakeholder and dont do any management but you cant work for a business for a few months then quit and get money from it forever
socialism,not_removed,just look at workers and look at capitalists workers have calluses scars rings around their eyes bent backs bad knees stiff elbows chronic diseases and massdepression capitalists dont the distribution of hard work is a matter of medical statistics
socialism,not_removed,the graphs can be found here httpwwwnewleftprojectorgindexphpsitearticlecommentsashorthistoryofneoliberalismandhowwecanfixit they dont show the period before the but you can see the drop in real wages during and after the while productivity continued to rise
socialism,not_removed,you dont need to splice and dissect your point to where its not clear and in the open its hard to make someone believe something if you yourself cant just talk openly about you also dont need to muddy your point under terms that would serve only to confuse someone first being introduced to these ideas its hard to make someone believe in something that they dont understand
socialism,not_removed,reported started writing my response deleted before i could finish for you mods you go mods
socialism,not_removed,i thought ableism wasnt allowed in this sub antipsychiatry bullshit is deeply ableist
socialism,not_removed,so now you arent even going to dictate this with a response
socialism,not_removed,the mentally ill are a vulnerable portion of our population a population that i am a part of psychiatry is abusing and exploiting this population with disastrous results pointing that out isnt albiesm the final article i linked to was more reactionary and guilty of writing off too much of recent psychiatric research without a look into the complexity of the issues my purpose of linking to it was the compiled list of spree killers who were on psychiatric drugs at the time of the act the rest of that article does a poor job at tackling the issue from a scientific point of view however the article from mad in america does a much better job at explaining the issue with scientific studies to back up the arguments i suggest you read this before writing off all of antipsychiatry as albiest
socialism,not_removed,puzder called california a socialist state adding that you cant be a capitalist there wat
socialism,not_removed,so much for trump being good for the blue collar worker

socialism,not_removed,child labor
socialism,not_removed,wall
socialism,not_removed,yeap nice isnt it i have hear something similar on the greek debacle lately the greek socialists wanted to give a christmas bonus of a few euros to those in greece who were on basic pension the euro group were shocked since they earned already or so euro compared to the latvian who managed with the charms of a market society
socialism,not_removed,id bet my life this guy couldnt even come up with a poor definition of socialism if he had a gun to his head you know where you take my money and give it to stoners who just wanna sit around and not work and watch tv just like of the us and about of conservatives
socialism,not_removed,actually you can be a quite successful capitalist in california if you work in silicon valley just not if you make shitty fast food apparently ergo puzder is a shit capitalist its like complaining a game is broken when youre just a shitty player
socialism,not_removed,rest in peace workers who honestly thought his administration was going to work in their interested truly fooled by his rhetoric
socialism,not_removed,maybe he believes that work would set them free
socialism,not_removed,so how does this work with all of the rhetoric he was elected with hes just giving us the material to work with the working class who got hoodwinked
socialism,not_removed,you know the one thing the one thing i agreed with trump on was that outsourcing needs to be reduced i have no idea why i actually believed him
socialism,not_removed,h per day from am to pm no lunch break you have enough with your precarious breakfast no vacation of any kind i dont care if your family lives in oregon or whatever and you want to celebrate christmas with them this is more important you live for me production production profit because thats all that matters
socialism,not_removed,time to initiate socialism in one silicon valley
socialism,not_removed,the epicenter of hitech capitalism where lamborghinis cruise past hordes of the homeless huddled under interchanges and overpasses is totally socialist didnt you know now excuse me while i spend a day on unsubsidized public transit so i can make a care trip in just under an hour they even legalized weed socialism
socialism,not_removed,til silicon valley is basically revolutionary catalonia everyone knows how far left those techie bros like peter thiel are
socialism,not_removed,the state with the most billionaires is a socialist state who knew
socialism,not_removed,nowadays its fair game to refer to basically anything other than anarchocapitalism as socialism
socialism,not_removed,he said he is so he must be right s
socialism,not_removed,unless we fight
socialism,not_removed,i was just thinking about how the iww basically came out of hibernation a few years ago to fight against jimmy johns because their business practices were so atrocious and it reminds me of what could happen on a larger scale right now the specter of communism is haunting america and its ready to rise up in the face of exactly this sort of thing
socialism,not_removed,this comes to mind never despair but if you do work on in despair edmund burke
socialism,not_removed,not unless we take control of our own country

socialism,not_removed,i was about to add fascism to that list then i remembered the horseshoe theory
socialism,not_removed,i understand the tendency to despair on the one hand but on the other i see a rare opportunity in history to fight a truly worthy cause against evil i never favored trumps election on the basis that it would provide such an opportunity but now that were here im embracing it its time to rise up organize resist rebel fight like hell for anyone with even a single radical bone in their body this is our moment
socialism,not_removed,anyone know how to build an ak preferably a cal
socialism,not_removed,oh jesus it really is that soon

socialism,not_removed,drain the schvamp
socialism,not_removed,keebler elves
socialism,not_removed,whats the parenthesis meme about ive seen it before but have no idea what it means lol
socialism,not_removed,i never favored trumps election on the basis that it would provide such an opportunity but now that were here im embracing it im so with you here i wish this werent the universe we live in but the silver lining is that the situation that trump is going to create in america is going to foment a liberal revolution of thought if not physical unlike that seen since the if we can survive trump by the end of his term a lot of his boomer supporters will have passed naturally and millennials and the generation after millennials will further see the rot of capitalism and the clear alternative to it i hope
socialism,not_removed,why an ak and not another platform
socialism,not_removed,is preferable in america ak parts are nowhere especially in an unusual calibre parts are everywhere
socialism,not_removed,oh i wasnt even thinking about the inauguration i just figured that hed mention his views on child labor within the next thirty days
socialism,not_removed,its used by people to indicate when something is controlled by jews or something like that
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,i moved across the country and left my life behind to work for a human rights organization what are you doing
socialism,not_removed,not the guy you were asking im in the uk trying to fight against our shitty government and you can join local socialist groups direct action groups antifa very important now and make sure you are unionised
socialism,not_removed,capitalism
socialism,not_removed,crickets edit its been hours and the guy hasnt responded dont downvote me for pointing out the fact that he was spitballing and has no real plan
socialism,not_removed,anything you can build
socialism,not_removed,no thanks theyre more about the ra than the socialist
socialism,not_removed,whoa
socialism,not_removed,yes this is something like what zizek was saying but im coming at it having worked against trumps election in the fall rather than cheering on his victory as mssr slavoj did no use trying to get the ship above water once a gigantic holes been put in the hull we cant unelect the jerk we can only move forward
socialism,not_removed,if you dont mind me asking what kind of work do you do in human rights
socialism,not_removed,honestly id rather have spitballing positively and with hope than this spitballing just to tear people down that youre doing
socialism,not_removed,i guess going to work or sleep is less important than answering questions on reddit
socialism,not_removed,he did respond though
socialism,not_removed,take a look at you can build an relatively easily and its pretty rewarding to see the end product id suggest remington over theyre similar in size but the former has inexpensive ammunition due to it being more ubiquitous if you dont currently own a firearm or have little experience with them in general start smaller get a and learn to shoot and maintain it those can be had for if youre frugal
socialism,not_removed,and theyre the only nonreactionary group of gun folk ive seen and theyre doing it for the right reasons im not too sure why you think they arent socialist if its because they dont recommend outdated soviet weaponry then please please reconsider your options they want you to be prepared not look cool
socialism,not_removed,what gives you that impression btw you can get an in but i dont know anything about it or if its worthwhile over an
socialism,not_removed,its a reference to coincidence indicator a browser plugin that encapsulates everything remotely jewish sounding in three parentheses
socialism,not_removed,i dont disagree with ya but i cant pass up a chance for a zizek meme
socialism,not_removed,what else fundraising for the moment anyway
socialism,not_removed,hey thanks
socialism,not_removed,i didnt say that theyre not socialists im just not interested in gun club culture
socialism,not_removed,the ak will have better recoil than an ar at the same price but the ar is generally better it really depends on how much you are planning to spend
socialism,not_removed,i enjoyed it though usually you cant intensify your zizek without some trite pop culture references to latch onto
socialism,not_removed,if you want to arm yourself it might be worth listening to the gun club people on how best to do that
socialism,not_removed,oh well dont feel obligated to immerse yourself in the community i just think that if youre looking for solid advice on how to arm yourself youre better off there than on the mainstream leftist subs that will just suggest a mosin
socialism,not_removed,i understand but my interaction with them ends there
socialism,not_removed,of course electronic arts and activision are involved ea never ceases to provide evidence they are a dirt bag company to everyone except their stockholders
socialism,not_removed,this union strike is yet another example of how feminists are trying to ruin gaming and gaming journalism again a minority group voice actors are trying to subvert the market and impose their will onto gamers just as the companies website states a prolonged strike only benefits nonunion video game producers and nonunion performance interests within the video game industry see just let gamers buy games they want and stop getting in the way of the creative processs
socialism,not_removed,theyre unionized through sagaftra though the contract for game vas hasnt been updated since they get paid far less than vas involved in film and television as well however theyre organized so unlike a lot of jobs in the games industry they actually have the ability to strike and demand better conditions wish i could say the same for the programmers
socialism,not_removed,i appreciate what youre doing here but im pretty sure people are only going to get a sentence in and downvote you
socialism,not_removed,feminists are trying to ruin gaming and gaming journalism im sorry i assumed this was a leftist sub who invited the gger edit i have now seen my error sarcasm isnt my strong point
socialism,not_removed,though the contract for game vas hasnt been updated since given the trend in labor rights in the recent past thats probably a good thing
socialism,not_removed,yeah trying to agitate for unions with programmers is hard
socialism,not_removed,which is why i dont like reddit as a forum it invites quick judgment
socialism,not_removed,you could have read more than one sentence
socialism,not_removed,i did im still wary of anyone professing that progressive movements are ruining anything in the mainstream that isnt pushing bigotry especially when such a thing is prefaced by the same drivel a known altright movement spews trying to justify not wanting positive change for anyone besides themselves
socialism,not_removed,it was sarcasm
socialism,not_removed,not only that it was really thick sarcasm
socialism,not_removed,oh crap i can see it now maybe i should stop assuming the worst
socialism,not_removed,its bullshit to claim that dsa is a pressure group on the democrats theres no institutional affiliation and none of the organizing ive done in dsa has been on behalf of democrats we never endorsed hillary clinton when people suggest a further break with the democrats i have a hard time knowing what that means practically when dsa members run for office dsa tends to support them whether they run as third party candidates or democrats i also think youre wrong about the newer recruits being more oriented towards the rightcenter in dsa many of dsas old guard which is basically irrelevant now opposed bds and leaving the socialist international which i think most of the new members i know support because the left caucus was the most active part of the organization during the sanders period it is responsible for much of the growth and most of the people who joined are more sympathetic to it dsa campaigning for sanders didnt sheepdog people into the democratic party it turned pissedoff socialdemocrats and liberals into full blown socialists i do think dsa has been and will continue to move to the left generally its pretty certain that most of the older socialdemocrats will be replaced on the npc at the convention this summer the left caucus will probably win a supermajority
socialism,not_removed,we should all push the dsa left we should not limit ourselves to one org or strategy
socialism,not_removed,i dont doubt that the lc counting its sympathizers is probably now the numerical majority in dsa and can win the leadership of the org absent some skullduggery by the old school leaders which i would never rule out the question is what are they going to do when they obtain leadership and is it going to be any different from what the current leadership is now doing i suspect there will be some welcome mostly symbolic immediate changes like leaving the socialist international however absent a commitment to not participate in bourgeois political efforts from my vantage point it seems like the politics of the organization will remain largely the same the lc may advocate for marxist education whatever they mean by that but i doubt they are going to embrace fullblown marxist politics
socialism,not_removed,the michael harrington approach of trying to push the democrats left is quickly dying out in the dsa right now were looking for solutions outside the democratic party many of the younger people that have joined recently are quite open to marxism and would very much like to see a new left party especially after the democrats sending a clear message that they are unwelcome there
socialism,not_removed,an article addressing this subject
socialism,not_removed,from what ive observed the dsa is pretty diverse some locals and chapters are further left than others based on my interactions with the organization there is a left caucus but to what extent itll drive the party into an even further left position remains to be seen
socialism,not_removed,no i knew some of the leadership in college they are old bourgeois and out of touch they are so scared of alienating their liberal friends that they cave in and are silent when it comes to democratic war mongering
socialism,not_removed,i dont understand why people think the dsa can be pushed left when theyre not actually a party they barely have a coherent political line in the first place and are basically a pac they exist to fundraise and to make people feel special with their super duper special official socialist™ organizer™ cards that they give to literally anyone who pays dues without any actual vetting im pretty sure theyd make richard spencer an organizer so long as he paid the dues
socialism,not_removed,a total break from the democrats would include at least refusing to support anyone that ran in a primary as a democrat primary candidates even when they lose have a tendency to drum up support for the more established democrats eg bernie endorsing hillary regardless if in that particular instance it happened to be ineffective by the way have the details for the npc been released yet
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,the dsa leadership will resist that they look down on actual socialists and think they need to grow up and get a job
socialism,not_removed,why should they leave the socialist international
socialism,not_removed,theyll probably just continue pretending like a welfare state is socialism while denouncing all national liberation movements in the global south for offending the puritanical moral sensibilities of lilywhite petitbourgeios grad student leftists in the global north who are clearly the authority on all things socialist while also harboring transphobes so you know what theyve always done
socialism,not_removed,or why not join one of the established radical parties that doesnt have the shitty harringtonite legacy
socialism,not_removed,old mature enough to not succumb to silly ultraleft posturing bourgeois do you mean employed scared of alienating their liberal friends politically sensitive enough to realize ml cosplay will not lead to socialism
socialism,not_removed,mao anything id rather not or is punctuation bourgeois now
socialism,not_removed,trolling another post on the dsa does the psl actually put you and the other psl members up to this to diminish interest in the dsa this kind of sectarianism does not make your party or socialists in general look good look i could totally understand posting about your experience with the dsa that it was negative and that you dont think it can move left but count the number of troll worthy comments you and the other psl people have made its unproductive and sad
socialism,not_removed,problem is that the american system implements rules that makes third parties and independents virtually impossible to win
socialism,not_removed,i think refusing to support anyone running on a democratic ballot line would be a mistake theres no doubt that dsa is where it is right now because of the sanders campaign we also have members like mike sylvester in maine who ran on the democratic line but primarily as socialists salt ended up endorsing democrats in seattle despite being independent the candidates for the npc race arent declared yet i dont know when itll happen
socialism,not_removed,i havent canvassed for a single democrat for dsa i dont think anyone i know has i was never encouraged to vote for a democrat its a legal category not a real party so running on a given ballot line doesnt signify membership in any meaningful way id probably be mad online too if i was in a shitty democratic centralist org that hasnt seen any meaningful growth and has worse links to the labor movement than the dlc
socialism,not_removed,we can outnumber them
socialism,not_removed,the socialist international is now a group of capitalist parties like labour in the uk or ps in france not actually socialist at all dsa leaving would be good
socialism,not_removed,hosni mubarak was in the si until just to give you a sense of the quality of people in there
socialism,not_removed,old mature enough to not succumb to silly ultralef ultraleft is an entirely different type of socialism old meaning stuck in the and mindset bourgeois do you mean employed wowi usually get that from liberals but then again always sell the left down the river to gain electoral power alienating their liberal friends politically sensitive enough to realize ml cosplay will not lead to socialism disliking the dsa for their silence on democrats war mongering isnt cosplay comrade its standing in solidarity with the international working class
socialism,not_removed,honestly third parties wouldnt win even without roadblocks like locking them out of the debates its a mathematical result of first past the post the proper term for simple majority wins systems the inevitable result is two parties that are centerleft and centerright the spoiler effect is a real thing not some boogie man if the greens get thats that would either have voted democrat or not voted at all so either a netloss or nothing so the party that greens probably agree more with the democrats lose votes and potentially lose elections to the party they disagree most with republicans its just the math of the situation
socialism,not_removed,i think refusing to support anyone running on a democratic ballot line would be a mistake this is why people call the dsa a social democratic party that funnels energy into getting democrats elected the democratic party is firmly controlled by the ruling class and is the graveyard of social movements
socialism,not_removed,i havent canvassed for a single democrat for dsa i dont think anyone i know has i know here in the midwest the dsa sent out tons of canvassers for bernie and also did tons of phonebanking on behalf of him theyve also been breathlessly covering the dnc chairperson elections and going to the mat for ellison want to know why the dsa has such high turnover and cyclic membership one of two things happen to basically everyone who joins they are funneled into the democratic party which is literally what michael harrington wanted in the first place or they go join an actual party and not a glorified fundraising operation
socialism,not_removed,oh how the fuck did we let all of our organizations get turned against us
socialism,not_removed,for now people will leave once they realize the dsa isnt a radical organization
socialism,not_removed,yeah i meant ultraradical posturing and that your use of bourgeois is broad enough to exclude huge numbers of possible allies whats funny is that nothing screams and mindset like radicals squirreling themselves away into small vanity ml sects thinking themselves the vanguard priding themselves on their ideological purity and stance with regard to the international working class while effectively doing nothing to make socialism possible you couldnt even challenge the leadership of your local dsa group to steer it in a more radical direction but some how youll lead workers against the capitalist class actually its not funny
socialism,not_removed,my dsa chapter has not worked to elect a single democrat the dsa national organization despite what you might have heard did not endorse the democratic presidential candidate parties in the us are not generally firmly controlled they are legal categories not membership organizations thats why there were still socialistsocialdemocrat gop state reps in the the dnc dscc dga and dccc are all corrupt neoliberal institutions with whom socialists should not work winning a democratic primary though in most states does not require anything more than a party registration very different from membership in an actual party this article sums it up pretty well the democratic party certainly serves ruling class interests we should not participate in its internal structures i cant see why it would be bad if socialists running avowedly socialist campaigns were elected using its ballot line
socialism,not_removed,micheal harrington died years ago dsa has not been practicing harringotnian realignment for like years if you oppose working for the sanders campaign fine though even psl urged people to vote for him his campaign created more socialists and probably even more mls than the psl or wwp has in the entirety of their ineffectual disconnected histories also your comment about being funneled into the democrats shows that you have a poor understanding of what parties actually are in the us
socialism,not_removed,yeah bernie turned me from an ancap to a progressive to a marxist leninist and now im leaning ancom while bernie wasnt running as a socialist he has definitely made a lot of socialists
socialism,not_removed,micheal harrington died years ago and his ideas still dominate look i was in the dsa and i know tons of other people who were in the dsa as well not a single one of those people are members anymore and thats typical the organization has very high turnover and membership always peaks after elections before cycling back down as people either go back into the democratic party or leave for an actual radical party its very much babbys first socialist group theyre not a party theyre basically a pac they exist to raise money and thats about it as an organization it exists to help reorient people who might otherwise be disposed to actual radical politics back towards reformism and the democratic party thats what harrington wanted and thats the line the current leadership still takes it cant be pushed left because its not an actual party the party leadership will continue pushing the harringtonite line just like they have for the past fifty years moreover they have no vetting theres being a big tent and then theres letting literally anyone and everyone in because they pay dues im positive theyd let white nationalists in so long as they paid their dues hell they let unrepentant transphobes like connor kilpatrick be public faces for the party so its not like theyre interested in any sort of ideological consistency
socialism,not_removed,dsa isnt a party though
socialism,not_removed,how old are you friend you seem like me when i was trying on a lot of hats but not really researching any of them all that deeply
socialism,not_removed,harringtons ideas dont still dominate a majority of members are opposed to realignment i dont know when you were in dsa but it has changed a lot our locals bring more people out for strikes and protests than almost any other socialist group are we a too big of a tent or made up solely of reformists sorry theres not a fucking week cadre course the idea that dsa exists to raise money is strange and one ill admit ive never heard before again you dont know what the democratic party is if you think its something you can go into anyway dsas for real psl wwp cpusa etc will still be irrelevant and tiny forever dsa wont
socialism,not_removed,shhhh the soc dems want to think that theyre part of something that isnt just a glorified super pac
socialism,not_removed,im i believe that anarchy is the ultimate goal the only thing i go back and forth on is whether we need a vanguard party to secure the revolution or if we could go straight to pure democracy
socialism,not_removed,continue convincing yourself that the dsa is anything other than a glorified super pac run by failed academics that exists to raise money for god knows what obviously not running political campaigns you know like an actual political party does
socialism,not_removed,dsa is a club for white bourgeois dudes who want to turn the us into a western european social democracy they will sellout to maintain relevance as all social democrats do
socialism,not_removed,well not even the anarchists are sure about that platformism is essential anarchists vanguardism me personally i dont think it matters multiple tactics for varied situations
socialism,not_removed,who can forget the great successes of the la riva campaign enjoy convincing yourself that psl or wwp or whatever is actually going to build a mass working class movement when they cant even coherently explain why they split
socialism,not_removed,is it or isnt it
socialism,not_removed,most votes for a socialist candidate since the
socialism,not_removed,ah yes all those great dsa successes like organizing grad student jacobin reading groups and standing outside of fast food restaurants yelling for a few hours keep it up
socialism,not_removed,thank you for pointing out my mistake the dsa is not a party for white social democrats its a club for social democrats
socialism,not_removed,oh boy that means a whole lot of absolutely nothing they are still insignificantly small
socialism,not_removed,its an improvement why is a ml defending dsa
socialism,not_removed,because before i was a ml i was a progressive liberal if i was not a big follower of the sanders campaign i would never have been a marxist these people may be liberals but they are just a few steps away from seeing things from our side sanders may not have ran as an actual socialist but he has done a great job of bringing a massive group of potential comrades i know we cant vote our way to victory i know its doomed to fail but as long as we can we should work with groups such as the dsa so that we can continue to draw in more comrades
socialism,not_removed,for sure i totally agree i was in dsa in college before i moved on to the psl doesnt hurt to nudge them a little
socialism,not_removed,you should make one with a salt shaker being poured on a capitalist slug
socialism,not_removed,i decided against using salt or salt for aesthetic reasons also salt is just confusing is it a four word acronym literal salt i tried using salt but i thought that also looked off plus the hyphen is reminiscent of cubas
socialism,not_removed,you should post this to rleftvexillology
socialism,not_removed,do not put text on a flag
socialism,not_removed,does anyone know where the cubanicaragua redandblack design originally comes from i think its sandinos but does anyone know exactly why hethey picked it
socialism,not_removed,nice flag now if you could do something about the party
socialism,not_removed,the problem with this flag is that the red and black says peasant and proletarian revolution while the salt letters says tax incentives for small businesses
socialism,not_removed,looks nice but only people on the internet call us salt we go by sa shorthand
socialism,not_removed,ok
socialism,not_removed,great ted talk
socialism,not_removed,you do know that the small business thing was part of a larger strategy for winning rent control in a state that bans rent control right of course you dont you just have the talking point without context you never wished to be fair just to further sectarianism
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,salt is just upholding the doctrine of new democracy and the popular front against monopoly capital comrade
socialism,not_removed,i think id rather be called salt than sa

socialism,not_removed,he misspelt social democracy
socialism,not_removed,seems really interesting and promising
socialism,not_removed,this articles a couple years old actually most capitalists are still in total denial i do not expect anything to happen until after the inevitable economic collapse
socialism,not_removed,which is why the fundamental law of capitalism must be if workers have more money businesses have more customers which makes middleclass consumers not rich businesspeople like us the true job creators which means a thriving middle class is the source of american prosperity not a consequence of it the middle class creates us rich people not the other way around ding ding ding if only you also had the brains to realize you are an arrogant asshole who deserves those inevitable pitchforks also why the fuck do people talk about the middle class as if its the only one that matters jesus christ people lack so much compassion and perspective that we dont even acknowledge the existence and necessity of the workers who make up the lower class fuck bourgies fuck capitalism and the bastards it creates
socialism,not_removed,if anyone has seen the documentary best of enemies about the gore vidalwillian f buckley debates there is a part that im reminded of where vidal warns the elite that if they dont give the people what they want they will take it
socialism,not_removed,capitalists have been using social democracy to save themselves from socialism since the if not earlier this is just further proof of it
socialism,not_removed,reading a piece by a bourgie dripping with fear about the pitchforks is oddly relaxing im totes getting a pitchfork btw
socialism,not_removed,in the us almost everyone believes they are middle class whether they actually are or not for decades it has been the medias way of saying normal human beings not those scary others to the point where it has become just an accepted part of the language just another way in which bourgeois culture spins the narrative to make it difficult to even talk about class struggle
socialism,not_removed,exactly what i always said about sanders and then liberals just dismiss me as impractical maybe they realize the system needs to treat lots of humans as refuse they just want an easier piece of pie for themselves just like the capitalists
socialism,not_removed,i dont think poverty was talked about at all in this election cycle and for bernie sanders the poor were always a footnote after discussing the hallowed middle class the socialist version of this is to glorify the proletariat and dismiss out of hand the lumpenproletariat of course precarity is eating away at so much of the traditional working class that socialist orgs adapted by lumping anyone who isnt a capitalist into the working class including the unemployed gigeconomy freelancers people a part of the informal economy etc
socialism,not_removed,someone should warn the people that if they dont take from the elites what they want the elites will easily squash any hint of dissent and keep the human race in eternal serfdom
socialism,not_removed,ever heard about bismark
socialism,not_removed,power grows out of the barrel of a gun or the prongs of a pitchfork
socialism,not_removed,i think its because deep down most americans believe the lower class deserves to be where they are while the middle class is the class of the taxpaying hardworking lower incomes
socialism,not_removed,if not earlier
socialism,not_removed,you mean that guy that leads germany from the stone age to the future in civilization v s ive heard of him but not really know much about him pretty much that hes the germanys first pm and he did a couple things politically influential in prussia before then any reading material on him you can offer
socialism,not_removed,yep from at least the reform act of in england and wales which is sometimes credited as preempting unrest reaching the levels it did across continental europe in
socialism,not_removed,no reading material but i can tell the story you see bismark had to deal with the growing popularity of social democracy or socialism since back them people who called themselves social democrats were really socialists so he decided to implement the socalled antisocialist laws which were supposed to cripple social democrats without explicitly making their work illegal it didnt work so bismarck tried something different he implemented the bare minimum of the socialist program things like health insurance disability insurance accident insurance worker protection and child protection and voila this is how the first welfare state was born all of these were later expanded after he died

socialism,not_removed,s true sir accused by joshua stephens and alexander reid ross
socialism,not_removed,yes after all of the articles i feel like we are no closer to the whole truth in this case however i think the accusation that he was a full blown fascist infiltrator which was the original charge isnt true he hasnt been involved in the south african anarchist group the name escapes me atm in a number of years id imagine that no one will be organizing with him so what ever potential damage he may have been done is now impossible there was a lot of talk about how influential he was and indeed i did read a good amount of black fire but tbh it wasnt that amazing anarkismo i think was going to do a full investigation because there was a lot of contention on the evidence i dont know what came of it
socialism,not_removed,americans are now going to see why the ruling class spent the last years obliterating unions
socialism,not_removed,worldwide strike
socialism,not_removed,this article massively misses the point a comrade of mine already wrote a decent response which i think is worth referring to counterposing the massive protests of the womens march with more militant actions isnt helpful the airport protests only happened because of the immense womens marches which transformed the whole situation and imbued millions of people with newfound confidence and empowerment and organisation to do more calls for a general strike which is not on the cards in any genuine sense arent helpful either at the moment its not mobilising to call for something so far ahead of where people and organisation are at the kind of action outlined in this article isnt really a general strike anyway and there is no mention of the need to build towards such an action by rebuilding union strength i also think its worth noting at this point that the grandiose calls for a massive general strike on the date of the trump inauguration by some anarchists and syndicalists which ended up being reproduced on this subreddit fell completely flat because they were not backed up by any mobilisation whatsoever within the union movement the american unions have been in sharp decline for decades now are largely lead by conservative hacks who are still gunning for the establishment democrats and no longer have any serious leftwing rankandfile organisations that is something we can turn around but not overnight and not wielding overblown assessments of where the workers movement is at our approach to the current political situation has to start from an objective analysis of the facts and concrete political possibilities not abstract sermonising about more militant action that frowns upon forms of struggle that are involving more ordinary people than at any point in american history
socialism,not_removed,deleted
socialism,not_removed,if this gains momentum i really hope a rent strike is also proposed too
socialism,not_removed,httplibcomorglibrarygeneralstrikedidnthappenreportactivityiwwwisconsin this is a report written by two iww organizers from out of state on the activities of the union during the height of the protests in madison and wisconsin the version is slightly modified from a text sent to the delegate convention and reflects the opinion of the authors
socialism,not_removed,americans wont actually strike they have too much at stake and too many trump supporters or politically apathetic people willing to take their jobs which is exactly why we need real unions
socialism,not_removed,i agree with you in most what you are saying anarchists in the us have to get the ue iww and many more unions onboard with leftist radicals have a sizeable presence in many industries before one could with any sort of responsibility call for a general strike the vision for getting far enough to pull it off however needs to be spread too i think that to many people its obvious that protesting shadow moves by trump at airports is frustratingly insufficient and the libertarian movement need to fill this void by offering visions together with longterm as well as shortterm strategies
socialism,not_removed,definitely less of a relic in than in back then it was like history buffs mostly in the us since then the union has grown to times the size though of course a far cry from the more than members of yore but the organization undoubtedly has the dynamism and the ideas to become a solid militant pragmatic and revolutionary union for all workers today the growth occurs not only in the us but in the uk and the european germanspeaking language area too the iww approach is to slowly build power by offering organizer and advanced organizer trainings try to vary workplace strategy according to what works nlrb elections is not always a preferred option and might only result in reformist unions raiding their shops in the end innovative things are happening too like the deliveroo and gig economy workers fighting and winning with the iww and also the possibly largest prison workers strike carried out last year thanks to the iww incarcerated workers organizing committee with roughly members ultimately how useful union membership is to you on a practical syndicalist level is if your nearby general membership branch is stable has good projects going on and has been successful in skillsharing and also of course wheter there is is a hot issue on your workplace if you have fellow wobblies there already and if you have the trust of your coworkers as a reliable fellow worker selforganization means that we together are responsible for failing better and winning more we have no other people to trust than in ourselves our own emancipation yadda yadda aside from the specific shopfloor part the iww has a good communityoriented approach to its organizing with the general defense committees that are now springing up as a nice example only your chains to lose at least its probably a better bet than throwing away your free time on building the party
socialism,not_removed,i hope the iww go on a mass recruitment drive
socialism,not_removed,what about teachers and public transportation workers
socialism,not_removed,i had an argument once with a person espousing the values of the free market because of human nature ie humans are inherently out for themselves what i said to him was that if anything its socialism that acknowledges that socialism puts constraints on human activity to avoid exploitation and inequality because it acknowledges that profitseeking is human nature and meaningful cooperation has to be worked for meanwhile libertarians want us to get rid of all restrictions allowing for pure profitdriven motives regardless of the fact that it leads to unethical shortcuts unsafe working conditions and products and the tyranny of the powerful over the weak and were supposed to accept all this because of the unfounded belief that a free market will take care of everything even though that goes against the assumptions made about human nature
socialism,not_removed,i like it but rlatestagecapitalism is a more appropriate place for jokes and memes and such
socialism,not_removed,libertarians are cute cute
socialism,not_removed,this isnt just libertarians this is all nonsocialists ive talked to im very bad at refuting this argument 😔
socialism,not_removed,i think selfishness is a nature of human but people misunderstand what selfishness means when people say selfish they usually mean being self centered but that is not the only thing for example when you help someone why do you do it maybe its because it makes you happy when you see someone else is happy maybe because it makes you guilty for not helping them or maybe because you want other people to help you when you needed help so what i mean is that everything we do we are always trying to get something out of it either consciously or unconsciously but thats just my opinion
socialism,not_removed,yeah trickle down economics what a load of fucking horseshit
socialism,not_removed,human behavior is a product of material and societal conditions not some static nature plus if people are naturally selfish then a system that fights a few people from being massively more wealthy makes sense so theyre kind of inadvertently making a supporting argument for socialism
socialism,not_removed,even acknowledge that its built on a foundation that doesnt even remotely make sense
socialism,not_removed,someone wrote this nice little poem in the comments from the bcpd to the transgender community i am not searching you because to me youre neither a he nor a she youre a that or an it on my list youre unfit to be a human nbsp i say she has a heart that beats like mine a brain that works just fine she bleeds when she is cut shes in and out of love she hurts with insults thrown she falls then up she goes though shes sadder than others whore sure theyre either boy or girl she wouldnt be if folks accept the gender that she chose nbsp she is one of the public yes yet the bcpd says that unless she conforms to their gender norms they wont serve her with respect nbsp o men in blue if this is true you must change your view since citizens need not consult you before their gender change is due you must accommodate for differences and contain your abuse nbsp usha nellore
socialism,not_removed,when the people rise again well be sure to ascribe the same value to your life as you did to ours pig
socialism,not_removed,how terrible of a career path is finance ive been thinking about it but at the same i dont want to a lose my job to a computer in years b die from the cognitive dissonance of working as the embodiment of capital whilst denouncing it at home
socialism,not_removed,uh yep my retirement plans are pretty normal im not literally banking on socialist revolution in the next years to feed myself its a pretty middle class thing to do of course i recognize that
socialism,not_removed,my plan is to generally do exactly what im doing right now until im old enough to cash out on social security and then ill keep doing this parttime stocks eh thatd probably be the smarter play tho you do what youve gotta do
socialism,not_removed,ill never stop working even if i make enough money not to but investing in mutual funds etc will lighten the load in my old age static savings just degrade with inflation and make banks rich something that tracks the market should beat inflation do i realize that my participation is part of the cycle of exploitation yeah i do but not nearly as much as being a consumer
socialism,not_removed,i have some very minor investments in index funds and an ira because the possibility of someday being financially independent is incredibly attractive i plan on continuing to grow my savings via these traditional low maintenance tools as much as possible the idea of owning stocks is anathema to me but not as much as being impoverished in my old age or if a significant health problem comes up for myself or my family right now i dont make enough to save anything substantial though so its a bit of a moot point
socialism,not_removed,thing about stocks is that they regularly shit the bed only way i would ever consider investing in something would be if it was something really really stable
socialism,not_removed,if i ever had the means to invest in the stock market without risking my own livelihood i might consider it though id imagine that it may just pile up stress upon myself however i doubt that id ever be able to do that any time soon
socialism,not_removed,you gotta play the system im convinced that socialism would be a better system that the capitalist system were currently in but since we are in a capitalist system you just shoot yourself in the foot if you ignore the rules even though trading with shares is as you said basically educated gambling other functions banks provide are fundamental ive seen uwatrenu comment in this thread the highest comment at this moement how terrible of a career path is finance which i dont agree with at all studying finance is one of the more important fields to study and i know banks right now have a really bad rep but apart from investment banking banks provide people with money to build their own companies hiring new people etc knowing how and why currenciesmarkets work is useful knowledge
socialism,not_removed,i cant really afford to i recently had to cash out my meager retirement fund to buy a car when my old one crapped out but theres nothing wrong with using the system to your advantage gotta do what you need to do to survive
socialism,not_removed,i only worked in finance for years and for only one firm so my experience is limited i worked in life insurance most of our clients were very wealthy and just used insurance vehicles to dodge taxes it was legal but i felt dirty doing it many times i felt like the whole industry is al about trying to legally cheat someone all the money is in sales and you dont have to be the smartest to be good at it if you have or can create a large network i think theres s lot of money to be made further there are laws in the us that make working in finance more lucrative than other career paths
socialism,not_removed,ill never stop working even if i make enough money not to would you like to or are you forced to do so do i realize that my participation is part of the cycle of exploitation yeah i do but not nearly as much as being a consumer great point i have actually never thought about that
socialism,not_removed,thing about stocks is that they regularly shit the bed they actually dont if youre looking at any longterm timeframe even in the extreme worst case scenario ie great recession you only had to wait around four years to get your money back if you were diversified its not a great place to put money you think you might need soon obviously but stocks have historically performed well over the long term
socialism,not_removed,investing isnt necessarily risky it is if you are a day trader trying to make it big but not for the average person just trying to prepare for the future you could just start putting small amounts of money in indexmutual funds or an ira this would allow your money to at least keep up with inflation with very little risk
socialism,not_removed,all the money is in sales and you dont have to be the smartest to be good at it if you have or can create a large network i think theres s lot of money to be made sales idk it does seem depressing really maybe i should go to law school or med school or become an economist or just get a stem degree i just want to make alright money and help advance the cause of the left with the moneytimeinfluencestatus i can attain from where i am now but its a pretty daunting endeavor sorry for spewing my thoughts out like this i havent slept for hours
socialism,not_removed,i actually enjoy working and feeling productive i hope i wont be forced to in old age but its possible everything we do in capitalist society perpetuates the system in one way or another what really matters is where you stand when socialism takes hold you can be donald freaking trump but that doesnt matter if you support the workers revolution
socialism,not_removed,of course assuming an economy with unlimited growth potential and investing in various parts of the economy your money must grow thats why investment is not taking risks as liberals say
socialism,not_removed,you sound exactly like me lately ive just honestly been considering dropping out of uni joining a trade school or union and honestly just doing labour and working within to organize the money is decentespecially as an electrician or something like that and theres a lot of room and potential to agitate if you dont mind the hard labourwhich as a previous day laborer i am not new to
socialism,not_removed,text if youre unemployed its not because there isnt any work just look around a housing shortage crime pollution we need better schools and parks whatever our needs they all require work and as long as we have unsatisfied needs theres work to be done so ask yourself what kind of world has work but no jobs its a world where work is not related to satisfying our needs a world where work is only related to satisfying the profit needs of business this country was not built by the huge corporations or government bureaucracies it was built by people who work and it is working people who should control the work to be done yet as long as employment is tied to somebody elses profits the work wont get done
socialism,not_removed,yes thats the one thank you
socialism,not_removed,the obsession over the military capability of the proletariat as a class and fears that it is not up to snuff against the capitalist class exposes most communists limited vision over what a revolution is a revolution is not a bunch of guerrillas hiding in the woods a revolution is not a military campaign a revolution is not seizing the present government it may have these things as components and responses to the course of the revolution but it does not hold or contain within itself which makes the actions of the proletariat revolutionary all productive enterprises are in the hands of a single class the proletariat an unusual situation in the course of world history hour by hour every member of the proletariat gives up the most their most powerful and precious possession their ability to work their laborpower which fuels all the production of the world therefore its the denial of this powerful resource which refines the gas that powers the tanks which mills the bullets that feed the guns which maintains the engines that fly the planes and so on and so on the bigger the beast the quicker and easier it will starve the most recent warplane in the us arsenal has parts being produced in counties across the us most planes have a ratio of maintenance to flight hours this is why ideally the revolution occurs uniformly across the entire country and internationally there can be no revolutionary heartlands no respite one class united against the other in the french government almost collapsed the president fled the country and the economy of the capitalist class seized because of strikes throughout the country thats where the power of the proletariat lies
socialism,not_removed,if theres one thing the past years have shown us its that the uss technological and conventional military supremacy doesnt mean its guaranteed to win a protracted war against a determined guerrilla army in fact most of the time its lost the naxallites in india have been fighting for years without being wiped out and yeah india is a third world country but it also has the third largest military in the world which isnt to say we could win a guerrilla war in the us today of course imperialism has provided a high enough quality of life that theres no way enough people would have the determination to pull it off and it would obviously be vastly preferable if we could get large numbers of the military to defect with their technologies since the guerrilla forces that have beaten the us have done so at the expense of millions of lives but it is possible
socialism,not_removed,thanks for this answer it makes a lot of sense
socialism,not_removed,this right here organization can overcome the gap strategic use of our combined resources
socialism,not_removed,my friends and i talked about this awhile ago we decided that the liberal left isnt even willing to admit that theres a problem and the right at least says theres a problem well everyone knows theres obviously a problem so they go for the person who more sensibly says there is one
socialism,not_removed,in addition to what ukingradical said trump in many ways has earned his not politics as usual cred without even proposing any concrete policy plans through his unconventional behavior and machismo persona the big problem with telling workers to not back trump is that the conversation then becomes okay so who do i back and any answer is either clinton who represents that status quo or a minor candidate that cannot win even if trump is unlikely to represent a change from the status quo the fact that he can at all claim to be a change is enough compared to backing the status quo candidate or a candidate that will have no impact on the future of the us government when i speak to people who are enamored by trump i point out a few things his vp pick is about as establishment neoliberal and antigay as it gets the gop platform is as antiworker as the gop platforms always are direct quotes from that platform here he has emboldened fascists to attack minorities and even if despite all that you still want to believe that maybe hell do things that help you hes just one man running for one office even if he personally wants a minimum wage lower than the minimum wage in the dems platform btw his partys platform wants to abolish the federal minimum wage and the congressmen from the party with that platform will be the people he will need to work with to pass any bills tldr dont focus on trump himself so much as the fact that hes the face for a party with a platform that includes wonderful gems like no federal minimum wage and deregulate banks no matter what trump believes deep in his heart this is what youre voting for if you vote for trump
socialism,not_removed,liberal left isnt even willing to admit that theres a problem the amount of oh theyre not right wingers with fascists tendencies youre just crazy coming from the likes of salon and vice is pretty telling
socialism,not_removed,the difference between change and its all fine now from the dnc is whats going to make trump the next potus
socialism,not_removed,i had a conversation turned argument with some rightwing people and they cant understand how i can see theres a problem and be a leftistsocialist they then try to tie my beliefs to every neoliberal policy thats ever been made every liberal president thats ever been

socialism,not_removed,╯°□°╯︵ ┻━┻
socialism,not_removed,i think i understand your point though capitalism has created far more poverty on a far larger scale than any previous system in regards to available resources only the difficulty in an argument i have with antisocialists is venezuela the ussr and hitler and china so i have to explain why china and the ussr doesnt count and explain how in oil dependent economies like venezuela that no system can prevent widespread poverty in a global economy where youre not self producing the second one is far harder to get them to understand andor agree with then after that theres the struggle to explain things like cuba or india where corruption is the flaw have a capitalist economy as corrupt as indias has been and yes itll be just as bad if not worse imho they love to use people like dinesh dsouza who is an immigrant from india talking about the economic freedom to go up the ladder in america vs the class systemeconomic suppression in india based on its like of socialism even though by definition its a capitalist country hes a republican and speaks against socialism because of his early experience in his home country but he came here when the economy was good in the xd they both cant understand that its gotten worse and worse since the destruction of the new deal and the extenuating circumstances that make a capitalist economy like the us great and a socialist economy like venezuela terrible nobody mentions mondragon in spain and its great success as a final note i think in regards to dinesh hed do well to read httpwwwsjsuedufacultywatkinsindia there are few good examples of socialism available and a particular system isnt a be all end all each and everyone must be administered well to work period
socialism,not_removed,i definitely havent refined this train of thought i was thinking exclusively of the agrarian populations of the unindustrialized modern world who economic forces obviously classify as poor but for whom poverty is a misnomer as finance and conventional economics play an insignificant role in their isolated subsistent life style these individuals are then frequently dislocated from their ancestral homes and shipped off to the cities under the guise of an improved quality of lifewhere they toil like dogs for pennies what im basically saying is that poverty is a relationship without the context of obscene wealth inequality our poverty is a nonissue so long as we possess the necessities of life and a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction

socialism,not_removed,first we have two states when the people arent divided against each other then there must be a no state solution
socialism,not_removed,israel palestine conflict israel genocide against the palestinians sorry comrades fixed it
socialism,not_removed,do most socialists support a one state solution i guess that really is the only solution
socialism,not_removed,traditionally yes more moderate ones might support a two state solution but thats not viable in the long term in my view
socialism,not_removed,i think most modern selfidentified socialists would support a two state solution but this would include a bunch of european capitalists for example
socialism,not_removed,capital is dead labor which vampirelike lives only by sucking living labor and lives the more the more labor it sucks karl marx but what did that guy know pfffttt
socialism,not_removed,i get the sentiment but distinguishing between honest capitalism based on honest labor and financial capital will quickly make you slide the slippery slope towards antisemitism
socialism,not_removed,a there hard evidence of this i can use to share to people who are convinced that wealth in the hands of the few creates jobs for the many
socialism,not_removed,doesnt google profit share though i know profit is fundamentally wrong but thats as good as it gets in this country
socialism,not_removed,guy had alot of foresight
socialism,not_removed,self service checkout lanes no more jobs most jobs are heading towards this path
socialism,not_removed,this is not surprising considering how much of an absolute shit hole that subreddit is hell they describe socialism as the state owning the means of production and that obama is trying to inch us towards that goal what a bunch of idiots
socialism,not_removed,rsocialistmusic
socialism,not_removed,great that hes back if only for a little back got my tickets for the leeds show in the post yesterday
socialism,not_removed,the options dont contradict each other they act in self interest but that doesnt absolve them of their actions kind of sounds like ayn rand to me just because something is for your own benefit doesnt magicly make it right edit would i guess correctly that you are from the us
socialism,not_removed,hate the sin but love the sinner is often misinterpreted it means we should wish that the sinner gets better and help them get better even while punishing them anyway i think there is always some amount of personal culpability in things cops are just doing their jobs but theyre still suppressing people solders have to carry out orders or theyll be courtmartialled but theyre still bombing civilians capitalists are just doing what the whims of capital dictate but theyre still exploiting people so yes i think that the phrase hate the sin but love the sinner when interpreted correctly applies
socialism,not_removed,i dont believe its truly their fault like they didnt set out to cause this they followed the rules after following the rules for years you get a clear picture of whether the rules are flawed or not they are but theyre just doing what the rules allow and demand if i were in that position id do exactly the same thing not that i want to do those things now but if i was raised in that lifestyle i wouldnt be hindered by morals so id be down to exploit it would be normal to me remember jacque fresco he said if you go to a head hunting village and asked the chief if he finds it bothersome that he has shrunken heads in his hut hed say it does bother me my brother has hes not crazy hes normal for his environment these ultra elites arent greedy or immoral they are rational and strongly moral within the realm of the only environment they know
socialism,not_removed,the fact of the matter is most of them understand and just dont care thats a little known frightening fact i know a few vaguely im related to a few too we are the poor cousins who get a few bags of second hand clothes every now and again to absolve themselves of guilt a bit one particular person expects us to do her alterations and repairs for free but if we need to obtain services from her husbands company we pay full whack like strangers they dont even give a shit about their own blood let alone any of you your just humanising beasts on the opposite end of the scale some petit bourgeois are decent people buying into the same lies as everyone else not the big boys though or even the medium ones
socialism,not_removed,capitalists are scum but the capitalist system allows the scum to rise to the top
socialism,not_removed,moralizing individual capitalists does absolutely nothing they are working for their class interests some bourgies may not even understand capitalism and the exploitative system theyre perpetuating talking about how evil this individual capitalist is achieves nothing and is completely pointless
socialism,not_removed,it depends people are forced to compete under capitalism it is unavoidable how you treat others when in a position of power and whether or not you resist the proletariat if there is a socialist revolution that you should be judged on
socialism,not_removed,there is no such thing as rational self interest lets dispense with this whole notion that we are rational beings please we are first and foremost emotional beings tempered with rationality that said one strong emotion is greed the lust for power and possessions everybody has it some have it more than others and thats what makes us individuals just like sadness or anger for example yet when somebody acts out of anger when he should have tempered his anger and thereby commits harm to others we fault them personally because it is expected of us that we can control our emotions why then do we have such a double standard when it comes to this lust for power and possessions why is causing harm because of anger considered wrong but exploitation out of greed is condoned im not talking about the legality here im talking about the morality i refuse to see capitalism as rational self interest its people wanting to be top dog thats fine thats a perfectly human emotion capitalism enforces that emotion but emotions should be kept in check alls fair in love and capitalism does not dissolve them of their personal responsibility
socialism,not_removed,some people are to blame some people just do it for the money and dont careare unaware of their actions being immoral i would even say that most people have no idea of what socialism actually is so they dont imagine other ways to live
socialism,not_removed,i dont in the strictest sense believe in free will and i think thats an underlying tenant of justifying punitive morality which largely disguises pleasurable revenge seeking as justice seeking with that in mind i dont begrudge the revenge seeker either in fact unlike most i find that when a person seeks revenge and achieves it at least in that case someone is getting something out of it extreme punitive measures rarely work in ways that truly benefit society outside of providing a mild sense of peace to the begrudged and perhaps food for some worms and even in a more cold pragmatic sense punishments generally work as a poor deterrent and in fact can produce more problems than they solve with that in mind from a personal responsibility perspective a capitalist is not absolved of fault for exploiting people or resisting a proletarian revolution though they might very well be unaware of their unethical actions in a few cases due to up bringing or wish push their bad actions out of their minds or perhaps ease their conscience with philanthropy i dont think too many people even in a nonspiritual cut and dry way are evil the closest one can get to that is to be a full on sociopath and i suspect that such a mental state is fixable
socialism,not_removed,i dont think very many capitalists understand the ways in which their actions are harmful but that doesnt make these actions acceptable
socialism,not_removed,is it pure black or pure white im sorry but come on
socialism,not_removed,the problem with capitalism is that it incentives exploitation thus capitalists are behaving rationally when they exploit people that doesnt make their actions right though because by doing only rational from your perspective you ignore the rights and interests of others thats called greed
socialism,not_removed,sounds like what you are asking is if there is really such a thing as evil i dont think free will has to exist just to condemn capitalists for what they do and remove them in any way available a debate between whether or not they have been pushed into what they are doing by cultural forces or somehow choose this conduct independent of all context should not determine what kind of violence is leveled against them in order to break this power or even determine hatred directed towards them it is their position in a power relationship and not what brought them into this position that should determine fault because it is the arrangement itself that needs to be dismantled as opposed regardless of whether they were groomed by social forces to be there or somehow and i greatly doubt it chose out of some sort of free will to be evil i think this is a lesson we learn with police which confuses some more abstract driven leftists by being both working class as well as the fundamental rank and file enforcers of these power arrangements it does not matter that they are doing it for a paycheck to feed their families they are still essential to this power structure their willingness to internalize a view that justifies this power structure via racism etc is mostly a psychological need to build an interpretation of the world that allows them to hold onto the only bit of power that they have in their lives and as working class people disadvantaged as they are they will work far harder and believe whatever they need to regardless of the mental gymnastics required because it is far more materially necessary that he do so based on his own position in that hierarchy and not only that but they have been granted the power to beat back realityby beating and commanding other people and shedding interpretive labor if ever reality should produce a contradiction between how things are and their interpretation on which their material conditions depend it doesnt matter though it doesnt matter if we can explain why they are they way they are regardless they are the way they are and the need to stop being this way personally if we had an overwhelming power to implement what we want i dont think revenge or hatred or a catharsis of violence would matter but these things dont always work out that way and sometimes people are only able to gather enough counterpower to defeat those over them on the hierarchy my matching their brutality if we had the ability to fight force without force and win it would mean that we had already had a massive advantage over them i dont think there needs to be such a moral distinction between violence against capitalists to end them vs some sort of more peaceful way unless we somehow get such an overwhelming advantage over them that this kind of brutality is not necessary in order to change things
socialism,not_removed,i dont think that capitalists should be personally blamed they are trapped in a system that they cant escape
socialism,not_removed,hate the sin but love the sinner is often misinterpreted it means we should wish that the sinner gets better and help them get better even while punishing them agreed i do not believe people are inherently evil and that goes for capitalists as well but actions have consequences ignorance of those consequences or ignoring those consequences because the system allows it is no excuse
socialism,not_removed,a bit off topic but thats what i always feel about people in the past medieval times like you read about genghis khan offering peace and protection or complete genocide to a city or william wallace turning someones skin into a belt for his sword and you think what the fuck but they acted completely within the morals of their time they were conditioned in that world its mad to think about when people act horrible in todays modern and connected world theres an underlying feeling of you should know better
socialism,not_removed,i never thought that i would have to explain on a socialist sub why just following orders or working in ones best interest is wrong the guards in ausschwitz also just followed orders and did it because it was in their best interest as they had thus the possibility to get a promotion for their good work the company building the gas chambers and ovens made that also in their best interest as they were getting paid for it and there was also the possibility of future contracts the whole reasoning ended in the prosecution after where basicly everyone except hitler himmler and half a dozen other regimeleaders where just following orders in the best prussian tradition if everyone is following orders and acting in their own best interest all it needs is one maniac to start some ausschwitz level of depreval
socialism,not_removed,exactly just like individualism from workers is ineffective
socialism,not_removed,i agree they should know better but we really arent that advanced people like to tell their egos that were so civilized and upstanding we really arent it depends on your environment george carlin said we are semicivilized beasts with baseball caps and automatic weapons barely out of the jungle
socialism,not_removed,they are socialist in denial yes i am for the people want them to be protected from wall street bankers workers to own the means of production etc but i cannot call myself a socialist because of the cold war propaganda machine making it too taboo for myself to feel comfortable with such a label label why labels go bernie democracy has failed me socialistsindenial
socialism,not_removed,at around the second mark you can see a socialist flag in the background gives me hope
socialism,not_removed,since there was a guy from food not bombs in the video im guessing a fair amount of them already are
socialism,not_removed,just had a discussion today with an old friend from college who was feeling frustrated about the current state of things after i spent some time talking with him about the contradictions of our system and the ruling class i told him to consider looking into learning more about real socialism he was quite receptive to the idea feels good
socialism,not_removed,jacobin missed a prime opportunity to hand out those a b cs of socialism pamphlets they print
socialism,not_removed,i have faith in the people who worked behind the scene at the bernie campaign from what ive heard they were considerably further left than the candidate
socialism,not_removed,i doubt most are socialists yet if anything theyre liberals who havent completely connected the dots that capitalism is the root cause of global oppression they are potential comrades its our job to educate and spread class consciousness
socialism,not_removed,someone actually said this well im not sure that not wanting to overthrow capitalism is the same as maintaining the status quo as i said capitalism isnt the real culprit here its that wealthy peopleorganizations are manipulating it to serve only themselves while denying it to those they see as mere peasants the issue here is young andor poor people are being denied their voices be heard if we can change the laws to prevent them from doing so then we can defeat them revolutions are messy and violent most of the time a much simpler solution is to get out message heard people do not want to hear the truth they downvote when confronted about their faux revolution
socialism,not_removed,httpsyoutubedwbzxemjzicl
socialism,not_removed,the flag looks like its from the american party of labor httpamericanpartyoflabororg its a tiny miniscule hoxhaist party yes folks an american party that follows the albanian leaderdictator enver hoxha lol
socialism,not_removed,ive found that most of them are a book by lenin or luxemburg away from being comrades
socialism,not_removed,its also just actual socialist organizations like socialist alternative there to work with the movement after all thats what actual organizing involves
socialism,not_removed,thats a hugev lost opportunity for sure
socialism,not_removed,i think tons of different events in the area were distributing that booklet along with other materials
socialism,not_removed,that may be a possibility as well i may be a bit pessimistic due to my interactions with liberals but hopefully our comrades in philly will usher them into this new socialistic awakening but other may want to avoid our label because of the cultural and political taboo socialists in denial
socialism,not_removed,people in the west almost never become straight socialist from the ideological void of early childhood almost all socialists were liberals first at some point marx as well probably
socialism,not_removed,i agree i think the problem is education its not that they dont want to be called socialists i think its just that they dont know they fear the stories of gulags and great leaps forward but havent read marx or anyone else at least that was the way i was
socialism,not_removed,billy gotta love em
socialism,not_removed,so youre telling me that the leftcoms strategy of denouncing other socialists on internet msg boards isnt the way to organize the working class sarcasm
socialism,not_removed,i think many of us here were liberals at one point i was swayed by good arguments and effective emotional appeals it can be done
socialism,not_removed,there are dozens of them dozens
socialism,not_removed,me too the manifesto gave me a good intro and the iron heel put me past the point of no return what is understood cannot be ununderstood
socialism,not_removed,one of the biggest radicalizing factors for me was this happening in my neighborhood i had no idea shit like this was going down wasnt paying attention the protests at the time and i lived far enough away but i saw that video on reddit i was a hope change obamanite before that
socialism,not_removed,oh yeah i remember that the videos of cops posing as protesters to infiltrate the students there was utterly chilling
socialism,not_removed,so north dakota is obviously shale gas is that also the case for west texas and nebraska
socialism,not_removed,to percent thats quite a range wheres the place where it shot up
socialism,not_removed,higher percentage of people living alone
socialism,not_removed,i find it curious why the middle of the us is going up while the coast seems to be declining in income
socialism,not_removed,interesting to see trump did best where household incomes have improved most i wonder about the distribution of those gains
socialism,not_removed,oil for west texas
socialism,not_removed,probably north dakota which went from boring ass farm towns with maybe a diner and a walgreens to a dystopian man camp hellscape
socialism,not_removed,household income is still below the levels and household sizes are becoming smaller because people arent having kids because most people cant afford to
socialism,not_removed,oil
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,surprising considering hte cut in oil production oil jobs and the price of oil
socialism,not_removed,legalise weed decriminalise all drugs set up centres where people can take drugs in a safe environment there should be doctors around offering clean syringes and just in case someone overdoses offer rehab to anyone who does drugs which also includes learning a trade while in rehab not to make them money but to give them a purpose in life
socialism,not_removed,especially in capitalist countries the war on drugs is nothing more than an instrument of social control it serves as an excuse to criminalize the poor and subject them to harassment from the police fines used to inflate government budgets and incarceration on a massive scale for the united states its also provided a convenient excuse for continued imperialist meddling in latin america even though the us and its allies have historically had tries to the drug trade
socialism,not_removed,legalize weed in its entirely and lower the drinking age to make cigarettes punishable by a fine and other drugs a bigger fine but not necessarily illegal repeat offenses are punishable by a mandatory but free rehabilitation program as much as i think we need drug control to prevent people from harming themselves freedom of bodily control should not include right to selfharm the war on drugs as a movement was explicitly created to be a war on the lower classes and a war on blacks the war on drugs in a capitalist society has no intention of actually helping the people in a socialist society is to actually to help people side note do not write text like you would text with a phone on a tablet so much hand cramping
socialism,not_removed,i love drugs and hate wars
socialism,not_removed,on the one hand its a horrendous crime we cannot experiment with our own minds on the other hand it taught me at a young age that those with authority love to spout absolutely ignorant bullshit
socialism,not_removed,nationalism is a disgusting cult and like capitalism is the unofficial religion of the west also i find it ironic republicans voting for trump are complaining about illegal immigrants not paying taxes when trump brags about himself evading taxes all the time just shows these people have absolutely no principled positions
socialism,not_removed,there is always an easy argument here but it usually just makes people mad because it challenges too much about their worldview lets assume the worst you let someone in here turns out that theyre a terrorist they kill people thats terrible but think about what problems you would have solved by not letting them in theyre still a terrorist they still kill people the only difference being that these people are not american immigration control never actually changes anything
socialism,not_removed,if your country takes part in wars in vulnerable usually third world countries supporting backing funding etc fascists pillaging a countries resources with imperialism etc etc than i fully expect your country to accept people that are running for their lives
socialism,not_removed,capital went global years ago its only right that people are allowed to move globally and if the right wingers are so appalled at sharing a streetneighbourhood as the great unwashed then perhaps they should stop being the first to cheerleader imperialist policies whenever the new york timestelegraph says that we need to go to war with a country percent of the population cant even point to on a map for freedom and democracy as you know the wars they cheerleaded is what theyre fleeing and all
socialism,not_removed,the thing that i hate most is the implication behind their criticism of illegal immigrants they act as though if had they been in the same situation as the illegal immigrant they wouldnt have entered the country to safeguard their livelihood and family its utterly ridiculous if they were in the same situation i think theyd view such laws inhibiting their entrance to a land that will provide for them and their family as unjust
socialism,not_removed,doug stanhope has an awesome bit on this httpsyoutubeqvyrwwkctkq
socialism,not_removed,im going to say some unpopular things here but open and unqualified support for open immigration is a detrimental position for any socialist to take it is important to realize that workers who have reactionary bigoted economistic views of immigration are expressing concerns rooted in their material interests and crass moralizing just accept them they may kill you but they would kill someone else if you didnt let them in or they are all good people at heart we are all brothers lets all just get along kumbayah is shit i am sorry but if you think most people would sacrifice their family for someone elses you are a fucking moron if you think that poor working class people are good or that people who have suffered are good look at israel where holocaust survivors ethnically cleansed a country seriously people who are forced into shitty situations where a lot of shitty things happen where crime is a way to avoid starving and where trust and solidarity are broken down by systemic oppression and drug abuse is the only option for mentally ill individuals are not good inherently they are people who want themselves and their family to survive and do well and they will do bad things for that its simple self interest which is the basis of class moralizing to these people or about these people is stupid bourgeois sweet nothings lets be real op you wont face losing your factory job to immigrants who can and will be fucked over harder than the existing workers are and while your friends probably wont either real people with real families might have to watch that happen okay so that shit is out of the way what to do about this should we let immigrants drown and die should we deport them back to us funded drug wars and political repression no we need to build solidarity through struggles no one wants to be paid a shit wage for long hours in fruit plantations in california or a factory in the midwest no one wants to lose their job to someone who will take a lower wage either notice a common thing that both groups might unite around there is potential to build solidarity between working class whites with reactionary racial politics and poor immigrants through the common ground of labor struggles but this needs to be made explicit and huge amounts of energy and time have to be used to educate and build around this the unpleasant truth is that people even workers hold shitty political views based in what they see as realties and we have to accept that if you arent willing to educate and organize around concrete material interests of people and want to moralize instead go ahead and shoot off your foot if socialists in the us stopped shunning and shutting out and rejecting white communities with shitty racial views and instead educated and organized among them to build multiracial solidarity based in material reality not bourgeois morality we would get somewhere of course this is in addition to organizing among impoverished and oppressed black brown yellow and red communities which should be obvious focusing on crass economism of the white working class lead to the often racist and segregated labor movements of the early but the antieconomism and moralizing of the last years has ended up leading to little
socialism,not_removed,sadly many americans are fearful and ignorant combine this with the fact that american culture is ultraindividualist and as a result you not only end up with huge swarths of the population who are only concerned with their own selfinterests despite the consequences but you also have people who are hostile towards any group outside of the bubble they have built for themselves americans want to keep out the mexicans southerners want to keep out the northerners conservatives want to keep out the liberalsits all the same shit all you can do at the end of the day is pity them
socialism,not_removed,its considered a sign of genius in the west if youre rich and able to evade taxes its foolish to give complete taxes by the neo rich
socialism,not_removed,and they would be fine with that oftentimes their reply is literally they should go back home and solve their own problems literally i dont care what they do as long as its not here
socialism,not_removed,the only difference being that these people are not american for quite a lot of people this is all the difference thats needed
socialism,not_removed,what jobs would they take to pay taxes if accepted into us there are hardly any here
socialism,not_removed,do you advocate total global freedom of movement or do you think that some limit on immigration is reasonable
socialism,not_removed,my response to these people is usually wow your parents happened to fuck in the usor whatever country you should get a medal
socialism,not_removed,thats usually the argument i make to people what would you do in their position wouldnt you do anything to get a better life for your family
socialism,not_removed,its less that everyone outside is bad its more that everyone outside this sphere isnt my responsibility so if you turn away a terrorist at the border who then goes and kills someone else in another country its not that theyve killed another bad person its that theyre simply not your problem at all not saying any of this is necessarily correct just trying to explain
socialism,not_removed,unless theyre native american simply mimic their mindlessness or we could see what the definition of home is
socialism,not_removed,how is a libyan supposed to go back and fix their whole government infrastructure economy and what not
socialism,not_removed,total global freedom any limit on immigration is bourgeoise bullshit that needs to be smashed
socialism,not_removed,um once heard someone respond to that by saying that the native americans lost which is all the more reason for us to keep out the foreigners these people will keep digging the rabbit hole until either you give up or you corner them and they storm off really no point in arguing with them at all
socialism,not_removed,most of the world at least geographically if not also by population is against samesex marriage suppose norway removed all limits on immigration do you think that samesex marriage would remain legal there what about the conflict that would arise from hundreds of thousands of people moving from singapore where the prevalence of female genital mutilation is over percent to other parts of the world where the practice is illegal what do you think would happen if there was no limit on immigration to israel even if you dont agree with this point surely you think that the case of a global pandemic is sufficient reason to limit immigration
socialism,not_removed,so youre logic is that because some countries do awful shit we should limit peoples ability to escape those countries fuck off
socialism,not_removed,the point is that there are wider consequences to immigration that you either think are outweighed by the benefits or just arent considering when people migrate they carry ideas with them and with enough people migrating these ideas shape the societies that they immigrate to with open borders there will be enough people migrating to homogenise all societies worldwide edit banned for pointing out some of the problems with an open borders policy abandon all hope ye who enter here
socialism,not_removed,just go away you bourgeoisie piece of trash
socialism,not_removed,the point of socialism is to make sure everyone starves to death just ask he hasnt read any texts on socialism but he knows karltural marx giving a speech to the frankfurt school of witchcraft and wizardry
socialism,not_removed,has a very good understanding of university syllabus i know he doesnt specify which subjects which departments when he makes a wild claim nor does he back it up with any sources but he is correct most of what universities teach is marxism international association of evil commie propogandists
socialism,not_removed,i support the actions of people to fight for a living wage i just need to point out that if my coworkers or i tried anything like this we would be fired and replaced within a day i work in a sales job which requires me to wear a suit and tie every day i get paid a base hourly rate commission my hourly pay is just over minimum wage working hours a week should mention im also a full time student i make shit money from my hourly rate i was on track to make a decent amount of commission from this pass month but because we did awful on our last day of the month we did around instead of our goal of my commission check for the month is under instead of being above which it should be now personally i was at of my sales goal at the end of the month i think that only other coworker was above of their goal so after a full month of crushing my numbers making sure i was fulfilling my job duties my commission is under if all of my coworkers were above it would be commission the worst part about this is that since my whole team was down everybody including me is at risk of termination at the end of december first i crush my sales numbers second i get shit commission for this month because my coworkers couldnt make their numbers third im being threatened with termination because of this ive been with the company for over two years only calling out of a shift once more that one occasion too ive covered other peoples shifts ive taken on responsibilities above my job description above my pay grade all for nothing now apparently if i made i would be making a lot more than i am making now if i tried to strike i would be replaced in a day if we tried to strike for our company would say you can make so much more than that if you reach your sales goal well mr company i have i went wayyy over your expectations and now im not going to be able to either pay my rent pay my car payment buy groceries for the month make my student loan payments or buy christmas gifts for my family sorry dad i really wanted to get you that cubs world champion plaques i know youve been waiting years to see them win and now i cant get you any memorabilia now before this whole ordeal i was expecting this holiday season to really fill my bank account but after this month and now no hopes for the next month i decided that after the new year i will be getting a job as a cashier at publix because with their tuition reimbursement and no goals to try and make to get paid decently ill make more money doing a mind numbing job which was actually my first job that i worked for years in high school than i am making now having to dress up in a full suit every day what does hard work get you in this country false promises crushed hopes and huge financial burdens
socialism,not_removed,ive been reading through this and only one person has mentioned any actual socialism or communism
socialism,not_removed,rbadpolitics
socialism,not_removed,totally unforgiving edit but when dealing with fans of his try to word things in a way they can understand and focus on other deplorable leaders instead finding common ground is key in time if they continue to learn about socialism they will see why he and his peers are nothing but tyrants when dealing with conservatives i tend to be harsher with liberal politicians and with liberals i focus on the conservatives but i always try to point out that both sides are guilty of the same horrible stuff because of my knowledge of politics ive had family members ask me for help in their facebook debates which i imagine must end up looking funny even though theyre conservative they end up debating against liberals from a socialist perspective no jesus wouldnt vote democrat his beliefs are incompatible with capitalism and the state yes clinton is terrible she is a puppet of big businesses who wrecks countries in the name of greed find common ground and work from there but dont betray your own beliefs the progressives who adore obama despise trump work from there focus on what values you have in common with the person youre talking to
socialism,not_removed,i look at obama like i look at all liberal presidents some incremental improvements fair play to him but overall no less of a servant of capitalism or its war machine of course to be fair my politics also changed quite drastically these last four years so idk how objective i can be
socialism,not_removed,the bourgeoisie have very strong reasons to like obama watering down your politics to appeal to bourgeois liberals is failure obama was a vicious criminal and enemy to the working class edit a very very very abridged list of some of obamas attacks on the working class
socialism,not_removed,is idea of politics is to blame for the position in which we currently find ourselves facing down fascists and neonazis expanding privatization and austerity not to mention a rollback of all the incremental progress that weve seen since great man analysis is usually inapt and particularly so with someone with as much trouble imposing their will on history as obama
socialism,not_removed,very
socialism,not_removed,how much hope should we hold for liberals none when the crux of their position is that things are better with the right amount of exploitation these are not people you can reach are they a lost cause yes have been since the this is a man who they adore to no end will ruthless criticism of him risk losing liberals once and for all or are they lost already they would argue we are lost
socialism,not_removed,comrades thanks for your thoughtful responses to this in one sense we shouldnt be concerned with pulling punches in attacking liberal politicians because at the end of the day no polemic will be a substitute for mass action if liberals arent going to join us in the streets then we certainly shouldnt care about them dismissing our rhetoric it becomes a moot point nonetheless i think im still going to write something like this on my facebook and blog feel free to continue sharing your thoughts or even to use it if you want as obamas tenure ends there will be some incredibly harsh critiques of him from people further to the left than you i urge you to approach these inevitable pieces with an open mind i know that you deeply adore obama but as cool as he is and as much as it means for a black man to have been president he was far from perfect indeed many on the left are going to argue that its these imperfections which helped pave the way for the position we currently find ourselves in if the election of trump means anything its that the current way of doing politics has failed that incremental progress is not only insufficient but can easily crumble in the face of the right that the widening wealth gap abetted by obamas policies leads to a dissatisfied mass that is easily swayed by rightwing rhetoric and is not inspired to vote for centrist liberals with uncreative visions for the future i know that youre reeling from clintons loss if youre feeling confused or even betrayed by these criticisms know that the majority are made in good faith they will be made in adherence to political philosophies that not only offer a way forward but an explanation for the past – political philosophies that have been abandoned by the democrats im here to answer any questions and offer any support i can so that we can work together to envision a country with an economics that benefit every class of society
socialism,not_removed,dont hold back obamas drones certainly dont
socialism,not_removed,im registered independent but identify as a liberal and usually vote for dems in big races please criticize and please do it loudly
socialism,not_removed,who is obama
socialism,not_removed,agreed you dont convince liberals by being an apologist for their shitty ideals you enlighten then to why their ideals are shitty and why they are best served by socialism anything else does nothing but discredit us do we lighten our criticism of gw bush so as to appease the conservatives i think not
socialism,not_removed,but he did a thanks obama meme on a buzzfeed video once he must be cool s
socialism,not_removed,but not all liberals are the bourgeoisie i know a ton of working class liberals who like him because hes charming and did obamacare and legalized same sex marriage but most will tune out when you tear right into any democrat exsocial democrat here thats how well i handled it so much eyerolling i think you have a better chance debating separate points and finding common ground first than going in aggressively re obama i listened to ideas about socialism and found i agreed with those before i was willing to understand that obama did some horrible horrible stuff but yeah its probably way harder to convince the bourgeoisie i dont think i know any so i cant really say eta also yes there is a place to criticize the guy too please do i just would not recommend making that a major topic in one on one conversation with a liberal
socialism,not_removed,so why dont you love obama
socialism,not_removed,do we lighten our criticism of gw bush so as to appease the conservatives i think not well conservatives are considerably harder to radicalize than liberals i also dont know any
socialism,not_removed,isnt there someone you forgot to thank nudge
socialism,not_removed,trying to trick others into accepting your socialist talking points is why people dont take you seriously have some bloody conviction in your beliefs and platform
socialism,not_removed,because hes not a liberal hes the same republican lite we got with bill clinton he bailed out wall street but not main street his affordable care act became nothing but a giveaway to insurance companies after he caved and scrapped the public option his use of drone strikes did nothing but create more people who hate us obama took a lot of shit and faced an unprecedented levels of obstruction from his opposition i wont deny that but it doesnt give him a blanket pass for the bad decisions he personally made
socialism,not_removed,conservatives are considerably harder to radicalize than liberals i used to be a conservative let me give you some help distrust of big government criticize all of the different ways the state keeps the people down criticize the corrupt snobby politicians who dont really give a crap about the common person i find it helpful to draw a line of distinction between the state and the nation a nation is a body of people united by their traditions language culture ancestry and a perceived sense of identity the state is a tool of class oppression a hierarchical system used to rule over others i love my nation i hate the state i think a lot more people feel that way than you might expect to most conservatives when they talk about loving america they are talking about their family their friends their community and very vague values which ill get to later not neoimperialism and mass incarceration i find that most conservatives agree with me when i talk about how the state doesnt represent the people a devotion to a vague conception of freedom in my experience most conservatives love freedom however they sometimes have trouble figuring out what they mean by that usually it has something to do with democracy if you reject kings in the political sphere why do you accept them in your workplace this tends to be easier for libertarian socialists too an individual should be free to do as they please as long as they arent hurting anyone sometimes conservatives can be a bit resistant to this because they might be homophobic islamaphobic ect but with enough persistence and the right wording you can usually convince them to adopt a you do you and ill do me attitude toward it yeah id prefer it if theyd totally give up their prejudices but sometimes thats the best you can get an admiration for hard working individuals i hear conservatives complain about taxes and how the government steals from hard workers all the time i agree with them the government is stealing that hard earned money but you know who else is the bourgeoisie sidenote its usually best to avoid this kind of jargon when talking to anyone unfamiliar with socialism the super wealthy big business owners the ect are all better workers dont receive the full fruits of their labor under capitalism this idea is at the core of socialism why should some lazy boss own property that theyve never even touched shouldnt the hard working proletariat own that since theyre the ones using it helping conservatives to understand that is integral to getting them on board christianity i dont agree with everything jesus had to say but i do see him as a protoanarchist pointing out to christian conservatives that their political beliefs are incompatible with their religious beliefs can be a devastating blow but you have to know the new testament pretty well i recommend looking into the works of leo tolstoy and dorothy day if you need help with this btw did you know that the guy who wrote the american pledge of allegiance was a christian socialist thats also a fun fact to share with them getting them to see that their religion is anticapitalist and antistatist is a lot easier and far more productive than trying to get them to stop believing common enemies we share a lot more common enemies with conservatives than you might think we both hate liberal politicians we both big business owners or at least the ones who hate america or are sending jobs overseas and we both hate isis telling conservatives that the group that has taken the most territory from isis in the syrian civil war is socialist is always fun go to rrojava if you want to learn more about that what they are doing over there is truly inspiring environmentalism this one might sound out of place since we usually associate conservatism with the destruction of the environment but hear me out a lot of conservatives out there love camping hunting fishing hiking and the outdoors in general making it clear to them that the overwhelming majority of scientists accept man made climate change as a real phenomenon is important and they usually will agree with you about big businesses tearing up our beautiful mountains or poisoning our water miscellaneous tips criticize western imperialism but not the troops those politicians dont care about the brave people willing to defend us they see them as dispensable tools they can use to expand their own power and the power of their financial backers be careful when criticizing police try to focus on what alternatives there are to the police and what flaws there are in the system ive found that quite a few people agree with me on police abolition but if i had spewed the acab rhetoric thats common in leftist circles i only would have driven them away i word my criticism of small businesses in a nicer way than my criticism of big businesses but i usually end up saying the same thing while many conservatives arent fond of big business most of them see small businesses as good harmless things that make america a wonderful place to live i focus on how it would be better if those small businesses were owned by the workers and managed cooperatively but i dont talk about how greedy and corrupt the owners are like i do with big businesses honestly even though theyre still exploitative i genuinely dont think most small business owners are greedy or corrupt most of them dont realize what theyre doing and are just trying to make a living andor follow their dreams within the confines of capitalism hope this helps
socialism,not_removed,marriage equality and womans issues were pressured from the bottom up not from the top down obama and other politicians clever enough to read the people are quick to support these movements when convenient queue every time a politician had their social ideas evolve at the right moment when having them is acceptable
socialism,not_removed,oops you are absolutely right thanks marx for your important work in shaping leftist politics
socialism,not_removed,how is it tricking people if the content is the same i didnt even say dont call it socialist i just said maybe focus on the parts that have a chance at getting through to people first its just being pragmatic and choosing your battles with other working class folks
socialism,not_removed,sounds like a liberal to me
socialism,not_removed,a few points to criticizeadd on to i love my nation i hate the state while your idea that criticizing big government is a good way to get more conservative people over to socialism is very good i would add that a line between bourgeois and proletarian government should be drawn since the hatred of big government is often a reason conservatives hate socialism and communism pandering to us nationalism is a dead end as communists we need to recognize that us nationalism is the nationalism of an oppressor nation and we should distance ourselves from it to build a country that can be proud of rising people up from oppression through socialism and decolonization not being a symbol of oppression and imperialism worldwide while there may be positive sides within this nationalism it is rooted in the material causes of it settlercolonialism militarism etc christianity i would add here that liberation theology is something for organizers to read up on if they are in particularly religious areas especially catholic common enemies one thing here to be wary of many modern fascists are opposed to global institutions like the un wto and nato as well as socialists the difference here is fascists want to reorganize class society so the ruling class is no longer the hauge imperialist bourgeoisie but the disenfranchised petitbourgeoisie and lumpen through nativism and a false antiimperialism this is really heavily seen with fascist movements in europe and america today this is a reason i think communists should move away from just fascism is just a tool of big business because thats largely not true many fascists oppose big business and imperialism in words but want to recreate capitalism to benefit those capitalists and reactionaries put out of power by statusquo imperialist capitalism ironically recreating big business and imperialism while we may be able to convert people over to socialism by our common enemies make it known that our opposition to these enemies is from a completely different starting point than the opposition to these enemies of fascists and other reactionaries while many conservatives arent fond of big business most of them see small businesses as good harmless things that make america a wonderful place to live this is true for liberals as well most of them dont realize what theyre doing and are just trying to make a living andor follow their dreams within the confines of capitalism its good to talk about how much of the small businesses are actually being fucked over by capitalism in general that they system that they thought they could make a living off of by starting a small shop is the same one crushing them marx talks about this too when talking about the proletarianization of the middle classes overall this is a great little thing of advice especially for comrades in largely conservative areas i think an important way to sum it all up is the way you word your criticism is imperative to organizing
socialism,not_removed,wow thanks for taking the time to write all this
socialism,not_removed,they distrust and dislike not just isis but muslims i have an acquaintance no longer a friend who does support the muslim registryban dont they realize that muslims are the ones doing of the fighting against isis just as the kkk dont represent all christians isis and similar organizations dont represent all muslims most of them dont give a shit about the environment they think recycling is a liberal cultural thing thats sad statistics studies and quotes from scientists can do a lot but if they cant find it within themselves to care about the future of the planet the future of their in some cases hypothetical descendants i guess you cant convince them
socialism,not_removed,and when the poor guys find oil in the desert the rich landowners will send freedom their way
socialism,not_removed,holy shit this is way more class conscious than i expect most adults shows to be like im pretty excited to see how the generation growing up on this show turns out
socialism,not_removed,adventure time and steven universe sort of make me want to believe the whole cultural marxist conspiracy theory thing slowly and subtly raising class consciousness and political awareness in our youth while also being objectively highquality pieces of media
socialism,not_removed,adventure time is seriously one of the best shows on television the next season is going to be the last it tackles so many issues of philosophy ethics mortality society family in such a creative and powerful way its hard to believe that it is a kids show
socialism,not_removed,adventuretime has so many great moments like this although most are a bit more subtle wouldnt surprise me to learn that pendleton ward is a comrade
socialism,not_removed,i didnt know rousseau wrote for adventure time p
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,well alot are probably being brainwashed by white supremacist bullshit or anti feminist stuff on reddit and the internet hopefully the people that watch that also dont buy into that stuff
socialism,not_removed,its always funny to me when people who do take cultural marxism seriously point to stuff like adventure time as evidence it cant possibly be that there is actually a super rightwing probusiness highly oppressive dogma in place that makes artists want to rebel against it by creating art which critiques it no it is more likely that some cabal of maoists has secretly controlled the media for decades
socialism,not_removed,i think classic hip hop was a huge cultural influence in my development to a filthy commie
socialism,not_removed,holy shit i never realized that until now but yes clearly the little shit read the fountainhead while imprisoned in lemondungeon
socialism,not_removed,the next season is going to be the last i had to check that youre sort of right i guess but season isnt even scheduled yet and then theres season whichll finish in still sad to learn better to go out with a bang than fizzle out though id hate to see adventure time go the way of the simpsons
socialism,not_removed,true the altright is doing untold amounts of damage online
socialism,not_removed,and the sad truth is that of the time the people who produce content with hints of class consciousness arent actually very class conscious or radical themselves finding out how liberal david simon is was a pretty sad experience for me
socialism,not_removed,the vast majority of american television is extremely left leaning
socialism,not_removed,folk punk was huge for me
socialism,not_removed,punk rock
socialism,not_removed,yeah that would be a travesty of it ended up like the simpsons im still going to miss at very bittersweet
socialism,not_removed,most people who make it in any of the arts usually have to be liberal as a prerequisite because if they werent it might hurt the bottom line of movie studiotelevision network ceos art gallery curators art collectors publishing houses etc liberalism pays especially in the postobama era but actual leftism is more shunned than ever just look at how little even the liberal media like msnbc or either liberal talk show host on hbo bill maher and john oliver have talked about the dapl protests or the prison strike
socialism,not_removed,how liberal is david simon hes made some comments which praise karl marx and thats pretty radical in our american climate
socialism,not_removed,justin roiland just shat on unions a month ago
socialism,not_removed,wtf are you on american television is filled with ridiculous nationalism and liberalism
socialism,not_removed,realistically though wont we at some point need a mix of the two assuming there isnt a proletariat revolution
socialism,not_removed,i meant more along the lines of a transition of policy obviously pure forms of either are mutually exclusive i thought that was implicit but getting people used to socialist public policy would seem to be necessary
socialism,not_removed,american capitalism doesnt allow everyone to pursue an education in something they love and are interested in especially if its something like a humanities course for example if you do finding a highpaying job becomes much harder and youre trapped under tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt capitalism rewards people on its own terms on whats useful to capitalists sometimes it overlaps with individual desires and passions but if often doesnt especially here the ideology behind this meme is clear you as an individual are nothing your passions are nothing your desires are nothing your interests are nothing your productivity and your labor is all you are to us and all youll ever be now shut up and get a real job for such an individualist ideology it doesnt seem to like the individual very much
socialism,not_removed,its an argument ad hominem that says nothing about socialism or its merits dont bother with it
socialism,not_removed,one its terrible how unappreciated social sciences and the like are theyre actually really important to society and i think we should be rewarding sociologists artists etc more than we do two education shouldnt be putting people into debt in the goddamn first place
socialism,not_removed,obey the market ignore all knowledge that is not yet commodifiable
socialism,not_removed,rather than provoke empathy it is better to produce fear ive noticed this in my arguments with the petty bourgeoisie those who make a moral argument get ridiculed and dismissed emphasize an organized front of the disenfranchised and they will become anxious point out a recent statistic that defaults on loans are nearing point out inequality and youth underemployment point out a lack of the purchasing of assets by millennials point out the looming effects of automation on the current workforce instead of saying isnt this unfairsay the current trends will produce a fiscal crisis and your taxes will pay for it whether you like it or not intimidate the wealthy into making concessions by instilling the terror of an actual political revolution
socialism,not_removed,it equates personal value with financial valuethe meme disregards this fictional persons opinion because she is poor and has values other than get rich the motivation of every socialist ive ever known is not it will improve my personal situation
socialism,not_removed,well id say i thought capitalism provided the maximum amount of human freedom its as if capitalism has actually relegated certain socially valuable in depth areas of knowledge as useless because its not personally profitable thus minimizing freedom i mean if i cant study insert useless degree as determined by td then am i really free
socialism,not_removed,theres another dimension to it too which these fucks frequently and conveniently ignore and that is this even if you are choosing a major because of its practical economic applications youre still gambling with your future because theres always a good chance that the demand that seemed ubiquitous when you started college will have significantly dwindled by the time you finish
socialism,not_removed,hear hear
socialism,not_removed,oh gee sociology major here that had to give up on a music degree for financial reasons glad to know social sciences arent the in demand field of study that capitalists want as well s on a serious note though i wish my peers and i had the equal opportunity to pursue our life and not the lives capitalism have demanded we live
socialism,not_removed,no thats a pretty loaded word that manages to incorporate a surprisingly broad pallet of sexism spanning all the way from notions of women being inherently duplicitous all the way to selfabusive notions of masculinity its also inaccurate my understanding from people i know who are involved in fetlife stuff is that cuckolding is most commonly initiated by the male partner in a malefemale relationship
socialism,not_removed,text november page in defense of self defense exclusive by huey newton huey on anarchists and individualists as related to revolutionary struggle and the black liberation movement we should understand there is a difference between the rebellion of the anarchists and the black revolution or liberation of the black colony this is a class society it always has been this reactionary class society places its limitation on individuals not just in terms of their occupation but also regarding self expression being mobile and being free to really be creative and do anything they want to do the class society prevents this this is true not only for the mass of the lower or subjugated class it is also true within the ruling class the master class that class also limits the freedom of the individual souls of the people which comprise it in america we have not only a class society we also have a caste system and black people are fitted into the lowest caste they have no mobility for going up the class ladder they have no privilege to enter the ruling structure at all within the ruling class theyre objecting resisting because the people have found that theyre completely subjected to the will of the administration and to the manipulators this brings about a very strange phenomenon in america that is many of th e rebelling white students and the anarchists are the offspring of this master class surely most of them have a middle class background and some even upper class they see the limitations imposed upon them and now theyre striving as all men strive to get freedom of the soul freedom of expression and freedom of movement without the artificial limitations from antique values blacks and colored people in america confined within the caste system are discriminated against as a whole group of people its not a question of individual freedom as it is for the children of the upper classes we havent reached the point of trying to free ourselves individually because were dominated and oppressed as a group of people part of the people of this country which is a great part are part of the youth themselves but theyre not doing this as a group of people because as a group theyre already free to an extent their problem is not a group problem really because they can easily integrate into the structure potentially theyre mobile enough to do this theyre the educated ones the future of the country and so forth they can really gain a certain amount of power over the society by integrating into the rulership circle but they see that even within the rulership circle there are still antique values that have no respect for individualism they find themselves subjugated no matter what class theyre in they find themselves subjugated because of the nature of this class society so their fight is to free the individuals soul this brings about another problem theyre being ruled by an alien source that has nothing to do with freedom of individual expression they want to escape this to overturn this but they see no need to form a structure or a real disciplined vanguard movement their reasoning is that by setting up a disciplined organization they feel theyd be replacing the old structure with other limitations they fear theyd be setting themselves up as directing the people therefore limiting the individual again but what they dont understand or it seems that they dont understand is that as long as the militaryindustrial complex exists the structure of oppression of the individual will continue an individual would be threatened even if he were to achieve t he freedom hes seeking hell be threatened because there will be an organized lower group there ready to strip him of his individual freedom at any moment in cuba they had a revolution they had a vanguard group that was a disciplined group and they realized that the state wont disappear until imperialism is completely wiped out structurally and also philosophically or the bourgeois thoughts wont be changed once imperialism is wiped out they can have their communist state and the state or territorial boundaries will disappear in this country the anarchists seem to feel that if they just express themselves individually and tend to ignore the limitations imposed on them without leadership and without discipline they can oppose the very disciplined organized reactionary state this is not true they will be oppressed as long as imperialism exists you cannot oppose a system such as this without opposing it with organization thats even more extremely disciplined and dedicated than the structure youre opposing i can understand the anarchists wanting to go directly from state to nonstate but historically its incorrect as far as im concerned thinking of the recent french revolution the reason the french uprising failed is simply because the anarchists in the country who by definition had no organization had no people that were reliable enough as far as the mass of the people were concerned to replace degaulle and his government now the people were skeptical about the communist party and the other progressive parties because they didnt side with the people of medium living they lagged behind the people so they lost the respect of the people and the people looked for guidance from the students and anarchists but the anarchists were unable to offer a structural program to replace the degaulle government so the people were forced to turn back to degaulle it wasnt the peoples fault it was cohnbendits fault and all the other anarchists who felt they could just go from state to nonstate in this country getting back home to north america now we can side with the student radicals we would try to encourage them and persuade them to organize and weld a sharp cutting tool in order to do this they would have to be disciplined and they would have at least some philosophical replacement of the system this is not to say that this itself will free the individual the individual will not be free until the state does not exist at all and i think i dont want to be redundant this cannot be replaced by the anarchists right away as far as the blacks are concerned we are not hung up on attempting to actualize or express our individual souls because were oppressed not as individuals but as a whole group of people our evolution or our liberation is based first on freeing our group freeing our group to a certain degree after we gain our liberation our people will not be free i can imagine in the future that the blacks will rebel against the organized leadership that the blacks themselves have structured they will see there will be limitations limiting their individual selves and limiting their freedom of expression but this is only after they become free as a group this is what makes our group different from the white anarchists besides he views his group as already free now hes striving for freedom of his individual self this is the big difference were not fighting for freedom of our individual selves we re fighting for a group freedom in the future there will probably be a rebellion where blacks will say well our leadership is limiting our freedom because of the rigid discipline now that weve gained our freedom we will strive for our individualistic freedom that has nothing to do with organized group or state and the group will be disorganized and it should be but at this point we stress discipline we stress organization we do not stress psychodelic drugs and all the other things that have to do with just the individual expansion of the mind were trying to gain true liberation of a group of people and this makes our struggle somewhat different from the whites now how is it the same its the same in the fact that both of us are striving for freedom they will not be free the white anarchists will not be free until we are free so that makes our fight their fight really the imperialists and the bourgeois bureaucratic capitalistic system would not give them individual freedom while they keep a whole group of people based upon race or color oppressed as a group how can they expect to get individual freedom when the imperialists oppress whole nations of people until we gain liberation as a group they wont gain any liberation as individual people so this makes our fight the same and we must keep this in perspective and always see the similarities and the differences in it theres a tremendous amount of difference in it and theres a due amount of similarity between the two cases both are striving for freedom and both are striving for liberation of their people only one is advanced to a degree higher than the other the anarchists are advanced a step higher but only in theory as far as actuality of conditions they shouldnt be advanced higher because they should see the necessity of wiping out the imperialistic structure by organized groups just as we must be organized
socialism,not_removed,for clarification he is referring to the may riots in france in where the government very nearly collapsed in the face of countrywide protests and strikes anarchists definitely were a major force during this time but so were communists and in even larger numbers so i dont understand how huey can point the finger primarily at anarchists for failing to make something materialize
socialism,not_removed,insightful comments thanks
socialism,not_removed,in the dystopia that late stage capitalism is the belief that we spiral towards a more and more solidaric society serves as a comfort in a world that sometimes for me seems lost thanks for sharing
socialism,not_removed,the only good fascist is a dead fascist
socialism,not_removed,fascism should not in any meaningful way be given a platform this is because it runs directly counter to democracy basic human freedoms and even on its own terms its full of holes as an ideology
socialism,not_removed,the truth is that most socialists will never give any ounce of sympathy towards a fascist it seems to me that the ideal order of things would be a society where free speech is a sort of imperative everyone would be allowed to voice their concerns but through selfregulation and societal mores nobody would listen to you so you can talk all you want but i want people to be dignified enough to ignore you
socialism,not_removed,why do you think fascists should be allowed to promote their ideology
socialism,not_removed,free speech doesnt apply to fascists because they utilize or abuse more accurately that freedomprotection in order to advocate for or ultimately outright cause the loss of freedom of speech rights and life of any groups they deem unpure or subhuman theres a deadly irony in a genuine believer of freedom of speech advocating for the free exchange of hated targeted violence and oppression of all freedoms including freedom of speech what do you consider a plain ol fascist
socialism,not_removed,a lot of us here are libertarians in fact libertarian was a term originally coined to describe socialists and communists we want to live in a free society where people can do and say as they please as long as it doesnt hurt anyone else we dont deny however that many of us while libertarians believe in revolution which is a pretty authoritarian thing really its of our opinion that its in our best interest to stifle fascist discussion that doesnt mean we think the state should it means we think we should we consider fascism dangerous to human existence and see it as imperative that we stop fascist views from being disseminated
socialism,not_removed,i think i get who this guy is comrade whatever he is he isnt your run of the mill fascist hes like a socialcorporatist he want corporations to directly run the state and isnt openly xenophobic i dont think its going to be hard to change his views give him a chance hes like a socialdemocrat minus democracy easy
socialism,not_removed,thats fair enough and i like the way youve put that you put it better than i did in another reply but about communists
socialism,not_removed,indeed because fighting fascism is sefdefense
socialism,not_removed,that before or after you round up the jews and the homosexuals
socialism,not_removed,mosley used armed thugs to silence dissenters he failed unlike the nazi party but he used the same fascist tactics they did that doesnt seem like a way to promote free speech to me or is mosleyitism sp is that a word lol different than what oswald mosley promoted and did
socialism,not_removed,would you advocate for hurting ethnic cleansing or further marginalization of oppressed groups
socialism,not_removed,then i really doubt you are actually a fascist i mean all fascist groups were as anticommunist as it can getby that i mean not only dislike but prohibiting persecuting killing etc etc etc
socialism,not_removed,what about religious freedom or interracial marriage
socialism,not_removed,you mean to tell me you think the blackshirts were going off on their own accord making bottomup decisions about what to do when they were fascists people who believe in topdown hierarchical decision making and that they used the same exact tactics that other fascists have used by happen stance thuggery to silence dissent is a core part of fascism and has been a core part of every fascist movement as is violence against vulnerable groups like jews that is why people advocate violence against fascists and say you dont deserve free speech because your political ideology is a violent threat in itself sometimes states like england use violence to silence fascists and sometimes random antifa do it but either way the violence is justified by the actors as necessary due to the nature of fascism free speech doesnt exist in a vacuum it exists with a set of rights one of which is typically a right to be free of unjust violence the violence of fascism is always directed at vulnerable groups and political opponents and has always been unjust violence
socialism,not_removed,im not to familiar with mosley could you describe how this translates to economic and political means to achieving your goals
socialism,not_removed,abortion rights
socialism,not_removed,then you are just as anticommunist as the democrats or mainstream conservatives i think well about me youre right i am for no platform for fascists fascism is what arises when capitalism faces a crisis that cannot be solved by the establishments liberalism so i see you all as resctionary capitalists but fascists are the worst because you are more violent and even more reactionary
socialism,not_removed,well from what youve said here you dont seem to be all that committed to fascism
socialism,not_removed,its most certainly not a core part of fascism and yet it was a core part of every fascist movement fascism preaches autocratic rule you cant have that without violence thats like me saying that waiting in line for bread is a core part of communism its only true in the worst cases breadlines and other forms of oppression and propaganda were certainly a core part of stalinism you cant run an autocracy without keeping people from revolting a simple way to do that is to keep them poor and too busy surviving to care about politics doubly good if you can do that and be the one generously handing out bread you wont see me defending that shit though
socialism,not_removed,thats like me saying that waiting in line for bread is a core part of communism its only true in the worst cases way to prove you know nothing about communism
socialism,not_removed,im trying to determine what makes your fascism different from more traditional violent positions what sort of fascist policies do you advocate for and how do you hope to accomplish this
socialism,not_removed,same im just getting conservative vibes from this guy
socialism,not_removed,to play the fascists advocate shortages have been central to attempts at communism as well might be worth noting that modern communists tend to disown earlier attempts at communism because they deviated from communist policy significantly
socialism,not_removed,mosley as i understand him was a more traditional fascist less hitler more benny little less on the race more on the state he was a big admirer of fascist corporatism and the corporate state set up by the italians at the time so basically mosleyist british fascism emphasizes state capitalism a little more overtly than its other counterparts that said he was about as much a raging reactionary bastard as the rest of the fash honestly though im in general agreement with the rest of this sub this guy doesnt come across as fash op you consider a trip to rwhatsmyideology you come across more like a rightlibertarian than anything else
socialism,not_removed,then why not just go to debate fascism then
socialism,not_removed,so basically your ideal government is corporations and government being one and the same and all of its citizens being in a slave labor state
socialism,not_removed,so youre a socialcorporatist like fascism but without xenophobia right well my critique of that is i dont want the government breathing down my neck
socialism,not_removed,sounds like he likes the current form of juche in the dprk
socialism,not_removed,he sounds like a socialcorporatist to me like socialdemocracy on steroids big controlling state the military and rule of law is king its like if you took socialdemocracy and replaced democracy with corporate heirarchy its an attempt at fascism without dogwhistles xenophobia and scapegoats
socialism,not_removed,nice to see some attention to pittsburgh in this sub im helping set up a chapter of the dsa there and our first meeting is going to be in early december were definitely planning on working with strengthening unions and the fight for in the city edit feel free to dm me if youre in the pittsburgh area and would like to get involved i can provide info
socialism,not_removed,awesome good god dont read the comments on that website
socialism,not_removed,interested in getting involved in this any additional info
socialism,not_removed,im out of the western pa for a few years but i wish you the best of luck and hope ill be involved there someday the region needs a vibrant left especially outside the city in my opinion
socialism,not_removed,lol and the postgazette is the citys liberal paper take a look at the local tv networks comments sometime
socialism,not_removed,theyre already seen as lower than dirt by the capitalists might as well be able to feed their families
socialism,not_removed,yeah as much as i want to see unions fight for better wages i dont see it having much of an effect on the whole diseased system the lowwages are only a symptom of the problem
socialism,not_removed,if you havent yet you can join dsa at wwwdsausaorg i will dm you further info for privacys sake
socialism,not_removed,we do plan on working with salt i think some of us have connections with them not myself personally were still in our infancy and establishing ourselves but we want to build a strong left coalition in pittsburgh
socialism,not_removed,thanks agreed were hoping to push outside the city limits a bit and get organizing out in those rural areas apparently there is a branch organizing out in greensburg as well cant remember if its dsa or the yds
socialism,not_removed,if i had a nickel for every time someone i read someone say theyd rather addicts die than be given narcan
socialism,not_removed,i learned that the hard way
socialism,not_removed,i dont know if i can take it im stuck with the liberal ajc and their stupid stories and comments here in atlanta
socialism,not_removed,of course and correct me if im wrong but surely any minor achievement for the working class is worth it even if it doesnt solve all the problems unless youre an accelerationist after all a somewhat more secure existence for a worker means a greater ability maybe a bit more time to organize read etc
socialism,not_removed,my benchmark is that if im not comfortable saying it to everyone its wrong and i sure couldnt tell someone struggling by on an hour with a kid that their struggles success wont have any effect because the system is the problem
socialism,not_removed,im not sure how i feel to be honest i want time to organize but we might be running out of time for it people are being pushed and squeezed to a breaking point i dont know how much longer itll be
socialism,not_removed,i get it still need social change but i get it ive worked minimum wage or close to it in recent years and i understand the struggle an hour would help immensely but i still think we need to be focused on the forest not just the trees you know i figure we can do both just know that capitalists will fight us on it tooth and nail as they always do and the more of them that are writing our laws the more difficult this becomes
socialism,not_removed,look forward to the day solidarity to you
socialism,not_removed,dont trust rt even if it tells you what you want to hear
socialism,not_removed,i mean the video was right there in the article kind of hard to fake that
socialism,not_removed,to be specific its the war memorial for british civilians who died fighting the fascists in the spanish civil war
socialism,not_removed,hope the fascists show their faces itll be entertaining watching the glasgwegians beat the living shit out of them and then the unliving shit
socialism,not_removed,the only worrying part about this is that its branded national action the group that the killer of jo cox belonged to besides that this is probably just the same lone nutter who put up holocaust denial posters at glasgow uni not much to be concerned about the icon used to portray homosexuality is pretty funny too
socialism,not_removed,national action the symbol that vaguely resembles international is there anything that facists wont reappropriate from leftists
socialism,not_removed,i do all four of those crossed out ones often at the same time
socialism,not_removed,thats some fire artwork edit fam all i did was say it looked cool the downvote isnt a disagree button
socialism,not_removed,yes its a statue of the leader of the spanish communist party la pasionaria
socialism,not_removed,as much as i hate fascists i would not like to watch them get beat up by glaswegians id rather have them imprisoned
socialism,not_removed,so uhhyou dont recognize the sas insignia then here have a history
socialism,not_removed,fascists appropriate everything from us
socialism,not_removed,a fascist in prison is still a fascist
socialism,not_removed,waiting for the bourgeoisie to deal with fascists their closest allies
socialism,not_removed,i dont believe in violence even if it means not killing fascists in my opinion we should try to change them
socialism,not_removed,i agree i mean im much more accommodating to the idea of rehabilitating counterrevolutionaries but to ignore the use of force is to simply ask for our freedom

socialism,not_removed,defending monsanto will result in a ban
socialism,not_removed,oooh i get it now its monsantos business practices that are provoking suicide through crazy dept i was going to call bull crap because i thought you were saying that the seeds themselves were somehow provoking suicide were on the same page now
socialism,not_removed,just leaving this here so the monsanto defenders stfu
socialism,not_removed,gotta love it when patent law is used to enforce a monoply on food at the cost of human life and liberals turn the issue into a fucking marketing ploy for organic©®™ junk food
socialism,not_removed,but what about frozen peaches s
socialism,not_removed,whoever is ignorant enough to question why defending the behaviour of corporations on a socialist subreddit will get you banned should do us all a favour and leave thanks
socialism,not_removed,there is a dedicated brigade sub that these users monitor seemingly to enter any and all gmo arguments on reddit they are dedicated i wouldnt be surprised if the more active one is postingreading hours a day on this its entirely possible that they arent on monsanto payroll and are just that invested in the topic not sure which is worse tbh but monsanto certainly spends a lot of money on social media outreach you also have your progmo socialists which may defend the technology but id be shocked to see one defend monsantos business practices as is happening here this monsantos seed monopolies the destruction of alternatives the collection of superprofits in the form of royalties and the increasing vulnerability of monocultures has created a context for debt suicides and agrarian distress which is driving the farmers suicide epidemic in india shiva wrote this systemic control has been intensified with bt cotton that is why most suicides are in the cotton belt for example is not an attack on gmo technology itself its an attack on monsantos business practices why would anyone here have a problem with this certainly not due to the usual misconceptions about gmos this is an entirely different topic than frankenfood and whatever
socialism,not_removed,its pretty uncanny at first i thought the article might have been citing some dodgy science on gm crops somehow inducing depression or something as you do sometimes see uninformed kneejerk reactions to unnatural gmos from the greenpeacey types but its the cruel economic consequences of monsantos seed monopolies to blame for the suicides here which are a lot more convincing and yet we see a lot of posters on rsocialism rushing to defend the exploitative practices of a notoriously unscrupulous corporation yeah
socialism,not_removed,i post in rsocialism and rfullcommunism im pro gmo im tried of the anti gmo and anti nuclear bullshit that pops up with many socialists and anarchists
socialism,not_removed,they run keyword searches all day that way they avoid using the same link and getting caught for brigading they all know each other and they follow each other around all day do a quick search for gmo or monsanto and you will see the same handful of users in every thread defending monsanto to the very end here are a bunch of examples thread in rvermont that mentions gmo look at the people with all the upvotes how many do you count that are in this exact same thread right now i count queeny wherearemyfeet dtftw and ribbitcoin oh look its a thread in rportland what a coincidence that ribbitcoin and wherearemyfeet are members of both portland and vermont but the only times theyve ever commented there are when a gmo story gets posted interesting oh look a thread in rseattle same users wow they sure do belong to a lot of city subs hint they dont actually belong oh look a thread in rottawa hmmmm oh a thread mentions monsanto in rdesmoine adamwho and ribbitcoin are on the job victoria bc ribbitcoin and jf queeny on the job rvegas queeny feet and adamwho best buds all together oh look a thread in a small random sub that happens to mention gmo same users hmmmmm rnutrition mentions gmo ribitcoin and dtftw all over it this bullshit has been going on for several years now
socialism,not_removed,theres too much of an antiscience presence in the left we need to show up to fight ignorance and big organic capitalism thrives on disinformation capitalist organic farming as well
socialism,not_removed,agreed fuck big organic and fuck big biotech
socialism,not_removed,the production and distribution of gmos are owned and controlled by monopolistic capitalist enterprises this is why it concerns socialists
socialism,not_removed,one reason that youre getting downvoted is because this isnt directly about gmos but more about about monsantos exploitative business practices nobody else replied probably because theyre sick off the other shills saying the same stuff
socialism,not_removed,if this had been a post about foxcon workers the conditions they face and their suicides would you be talking about how smartphones arent relevant to socialism its an article about conditions facing the working class under capitalism if you dont expect to see that there what do you expect
socialism,not_removed,monsantos exclusive patents are effectively monopolizing part of a key means of production seeds for crops their monopoly is exploiting farmers to the point of desperation
socialism,not_removed,you monsanto shills never give up huh go back to rgmomyths
socialism,not_removed,monsanto shill rgmomyths brigade
socialism,not_removed,youre a monsanto shill anyone can check your post history and see that and rhillaryforamerica fuck are you on the wrong sub take your shill links and shove them
socialism,not_removed,only nonmonsanto frozen peaches are allowed
socialism,not_removed,most socialists are progmo but antimonsanto
socialism,not_removed,fyi they all belong to rgmomyths but thats not where they do their brigading from what they actually do is run searches all day for gmo and monsanto this allows them to find all new threads on the subject but circumvents using the same link to find the thread thus avoiding getting caught for brigading this post provides really nice examples of their bullshit edit they only use gmomyths after the fact to whine and make fun of people like they did for this thread after they all got banned be careful what you say though they are very quick to run to the admins to try and get you banned for witch hunting
socialism,not_removed,what antigmo bullshit do you see in this article its primarily focused on monsantos seed monopolies the destruction of alternatives the collection of superprofits in the form of royalties and the increasing vulnerability of monocultures has created a context for debt suicides and agrarian distress which is driving the farmers suicide epidemic in india shiva wrote this systemic control has been intensified with bt cotton that is why most suicides are in the cotton belt which has nothing to do with the hippy naturalistic shit that youre probably tired of nothing to do with gmos in and of themselves are you tired of people critiquing and reporting on monsanto itself
socialism,not_removed,you can be progmo but anti corporation though obviously or we wouldnt be here
socialism,not_removed,so far gmos have been horrible in theory they could be great but under capitalism we should be critiquing gmos
socialism,not_removed,i hate big organic nearly as much as i hate monsanto tbh its a usda approved marketing scheme with a stated goal of making produce harder for poor people to buy
socialism,not_removed,i use roundup im the biggest shill
socialism,not_removed,i think theres a sizable population who are okay with gmos conceptually but dont trust their usage under capitalism
socialism,not_removed,id wager that most socialists are ambivalent and dont really care but idk
socialism,not_removed,good to know thanks
socialism,not_removed,interesting because it seems to be most correlated with how hard it is get a loan andor crop insurance
socialism,not_removed,when seeds are genetically modified to produce infertile plants to prevent seed saving terrible contractsloans and legalpolitical infrastructure by multinational ngos and client information and declaring ip sovereignty against formerly existing seed stock
socialism,not_removed,probably something to do with vandana shiva being one of the biggest spokespeople for big organic
socialism,not_removed,on reddit and facebook it seem were in the minority
socialism,not_removed,theyre def shills if you sub to renvironment youd see that they only come out of the woodwork when something negative is said about monsanto even if its not questioning the science or whathaveyou just to put a monsantopositive spin on it
socialism,not_removed,were passionate because were tried of the false propaganda which is promoted to attack non organic crops hell im having a hard time finding cheap veggies because supermarkets are filling up with higher profit margin organic foods
socialism,not_removed,plus they still use incredibly toxic pesticides
socialism,not_removed,you guys all show up in literally every thread where the word monsanto is uttered what are they paying you i know you were all banned from ranarchism maybe rsocialism should follow suit denying farmer suicides is a whole new low
socialism,not_removed,you really expect a response to a year old article which is meant to debunk a article
socialism,not_removed,i dont see you on the list the other are tho
socialism,not_removed,why would i go away im actually a socialist deny these suicides one more time and ill make it my personal crusade to inform every sub on reddit what you are
socialism,not_removed,i can say with the utmost certainty that i dont really give a shit about gmos so youre spot on there
socialism,not_removed,oh really your local super market is being taken over by the organic industry huh that sounds totally plausible and realistic
socialism,not_removed,a year old study funded by agribusiness real evidence httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinternationalfoodpolicyresearchinstitutecriticism
socialism,not_removed,you should read about gmos because you should absolutely give a shit they are how we will get good quality food to the most people unfortunately capitalism has rendered them another instrument of oppression
socialism,not_removed,go to a fred meyer or a safeway years ago youll find only one table for organic now half of the veggie department is organic
socialism,not_removed,til suicides is bullshit
socialism,not_removed,do you all construct responses from the same guide ive seen echo chamber so much from suspected shills
socialism,not_removed,bullshit we already make enough food for the world the problem is distribution up till now gmos have been pretty much exclusively oppressive i dont doubt that they can do good for humanity under a socialist system but as of now we should be opposing gmos
socialism,not_removed,as i work at albertsons which owns safeway i can confirm that a there are more organic produce than in the past and b that theres still nonorganic options on all of the organic produce items in other words organic does have a bigger floor share in the past your statement is true but there are still nonorganic produce available your unspoken assertion is false headed back in for some more wage exploitation wish me luck
socialism,not_removed,gmos are not only cheaper but allow us to grow better quality food thats more nutritious theres also bullshit about how you define a gmo hybrid plants have been a thing for centuries but suddenly people are terrified of gmos even though theyre subject to stricter to regulation gmo as a function of intellectual property as a function of capitalist firms exploiting farmers as a function of protectionist trade has been horribly oppressive but you can say that about a whole lot of things we enjoy also gmos are also a way to grow meat with a much smaller biological footprint but thats a separate issue
socialism,not_removed,why do you believe that gmos will continue to be instruments of oppression after the revolution
socialism,not_removed,matters on location pnw of the us is starting to sell more organic due to its popularity
socialism,not_removed,i dont know much about the meat but the stuff monsanto uses means that they have to use more herbacides and thus a bigger footprint
socialism,not_removed,well possibly not but under capitalism they are oppressive and its pointless to constantly talk about how good they might be when in reality its a tool of oppressing workers also its not purely a change win economic systems that would make them suddenly a fantastic tool of humanity because of production forprofit gmos are used un ways that are bad for the environment and for workers
socialism,not_removed,i agree thank you for the answer
socialism,not_removed,i believe the word youre looking for is intersectionality not identity politics identity politics is by its very definition exclusionary and has an obvious rightwing varient in the form of nationalism a hilarious facet of this is that altright weirdos decry identity politics while literally supporting identitarianism of course the general intersectionality movement isnt perfect as there are a lot of liberal proponents who minimise classism and hence fall into identity politics a perfect example of this is the everyday feminism article which discussed how to be sensetive to your workers suffering from food insecurity without any mention of raising pay when being poor is treated as another social identity not as a social evil that shows a big problem with identity politics in fact the very brocialists you decry are themselves conducting identity politics because they identify the proletariat with primarily that white hetrosexual cisgender identity rather than acknowledging its diverse character modern intersectional feminism should be the opposite of identity politics by ensuring that feminism tackles the issues facing all people
socialism,not_removed,i think youre mistaking actual identity politics which are shit for the identity politics strawman created by reactionaries whether masquerading as leftists the brocialists or otherwise who are looking for a way to justify their oppressive ideologies identity politics is a plague because it is specifically a leftliberal ideology which attempts to reduce struggle to issues of race gender etc thereby eliminating the basis of class and allowing the bourgeoisie to hop on board it effectively is a means of appropriating the struggles of minority groups it fails so miserably because it uses guilt and because it cannot bring class into the equation blames the necessity of these struggles on whiteness or patriarchy the clinton campaign is a perfect example of this like half of it was composed of feminists blaming her failures on men being sexist not being ready for a female president etc etc ignoring the fact or being incapable of seeing the fact or the problem with it that clinton is just a horribly transparent bourgeois stooge being opposed to this is not to say these struggles are irrelevant or negative far from it these struggles should be and are integral to the proletarian struggle
socialism,not_removed,and in germany britain and netherlands the working class are massively white eastern european when i go to leftist meetings that demographic is always completely ignored when people talk about discriminated groups in society the main problem is that identity politics straightly imported from usa dont apply as well to other countries because their analysis is based not on how these discriminations are symptoms of class society but how it seems like it is in a particular country and then its attempted to apply it worldwide where the superficial observation and usually shite solutions are so baseless that they get easily hijacked by the ruling class proving idpols powerlessness
socialism,not_removed,well written saved for future reference
socialism,not_removed,okhand
socialism,not_removed,what do you mean by romantic minorities is that like an asexual man who is in a romantic relationship with another man
socialism,not_removed,is there a guide somewhere that describes what exactly intolerable brocialism consists of
socialism,not_removed,not to mention the clinton campaign and associated liberal media outlets tried their best during the primaries to paint the bernie campaign as sexist brocialist etc whenever i hear the word brocialist i think back to vox using that word against everyone who disagreed with them in order to silence them and render everything they had to say meaningless because you dont have to listen to them if its just the ravings of a bigot
socialism,not_removed,how is the proletarian struggle a class identity not a form of identity politics again
socialism,not_removed,the reason why eastern europeans are so ignored in britain is because the media wants to continue playing the working class off against eachother eastern europeans are the easiest scapegoat because repressive uk voting laws need you to have been resident for years before voting they cant even vote
socialism,not_removed,because the proletarian struggle necessarily incorporates all struggles of identity liberal identity politics says nothing of class this is its primary fault
socialism,not_removed,yeah and the reason would be is that according to some polls i saw ages ago only would vote tory it was like labour green and libs even from my own experience immigrants always have some radical views which can be easily steered into socialism there was another study which said that eastern europeans are less wealthy than jamaican and african immigrants to the uk but something something white privilege something something what even is capitalism
socialism,not_removed,sure but not every asshole who marginalizes oppressed people is a brocialist so what are the defining characteristics of brocialism
socialism,not_removed,class is the only thing that oppressed white men they still have gender and racial identities they arent aware of them cismen are still conditioned to be violent and emotionally unavailable by our society which the capitalist class uses to their advantage and encourages that sort of behavior just as cisman exploit working people for their emotional labor being white they still take advantage of the social privileges awarded to them which makes their class identities easier to bare like how they can get a job outside of prison easier than their counterparts of color besides one cannot separate race from class and gender gender from class and race class from race and gender
socialism,not_removed,a brocialist is someone who essentially discounts intersectionalism and focuses only on class they would for example say that black people are oppressed only or primarily through their class and not also systematic racism their fault lies in their discounting of real problems of racism sexism transphobia homophobia not true in all cases but this commonly stems from the brocialist having some sort of privilege that allows them to focus only on class without realizing the struggles of others
socialism,not_removed,the hell does any of this have to do with anything
socialism,not_removed,did this term evolve out of the identitarian neoliberal smear berniebro or does it have a separate origin
socialism,not_removed,critiquing your brocialist analysis like simply putting forth class as the ultimate libertory quest reveals ones devotion to the other facets of kyriarchy a structre that only white men need to dismantle
socialism,not_removed,definitely predates it i suspect it was invented on this subreddit or from related platforms
socialism,not_removed,youre reading so much wrong into what ive said a proletarian struggle that minimises minority struggles is not a proletarian struggle this is brocialism identity politics is just as shit because it ignores class whats difficult to understand here
socialism,not_removed,white identity politics are shit yes because they forward the politics of the oppressor and if you think calling someone by their proper pronouns is shit because it ignores class then you have bigger issues is fighting against sexual harassment and rape also shit
socialism,not_removed,what the fuck is your deal where did i suggest any of that
socialism,not_removed,identity politics are shit is where you suggested that
socialism,not_removed,fuck modi long live the naxalite revolution
socialism,not_removed,the idea the cpk was not responsible for genocide is laughable read the interviews with ta mok or pol pot that exist they explicitly hated and wanted to wipe out all those who were chinese and vietnamese or were of mixed decent in cambodia the party even made a public radio broadcast calling for the extermination of the entire vietnamese people during the war their entire line was based on the theory that the kampucheans were racially superior to other southeast asians and that bourgeois tendencies came from foreigners so anyone engaged in them simply werent khmer and should be eliminated they abolished money not for marxist reasons but because it could be used as means to undermine their plans for national renewal by foreign powers similarly their creation of communes was in order to create an agricultural surplus for hard cash to purchase equipment for agricultural industrialization while simultaneously expelling all aid workers and refusing assistance from the socialist countries out of a misguided idea of selfreliance fundamentally their revolution was defined by revanchism wounded national pride and racial hatred not the goal of workers emancipation their selfdescription as communists can be traced to the participation of members in the french communist party and learning basic concepts like class struggle which they took in antimarxist directions similarly to how mussolini adopted the theory of proletarian vs bourgeois nations the cpk can be best described as national communist httpwwwnatethayercomlunchingwithmassmurderersthekhmerrougewerenotcommuniststheywerecambodians
socialism,not_removed,have you even read the essay youre just repeating what it says
socialism,not_removed,i did read it and it lays the genocide at the feet on the us rather than the regime in the beginning which is ridiculous the mass killing isnt what constitutes the genocide its the wiping out of minority peoples vietnamese chinese and southern muslims on a racist basis the us didnt force them to do this
socialism,not_removed,i am very certain it deals with that and does not blame the us it blames the us for the bombing campaigns and the present state of cambodia
socialism,not_removed,if anyone should be on trial for genocide in southeast asia it should be the us ruling class the charges of genocide the rulers of the us want to press against former cpk leaders are an attempt to reverse right and wrong from the article
socialism,not_removed,i have tried to start this or times but have stopped so let me be blunt this process was conducted the same way every one has since we started doing them there is no deviation from accepted practices we ask the users who they want usually people nominate themselves we give it a couple days for people to voice their opinions and then we look over the support after that we have a discussion as mods to decide of those people who best fit there are reasons for this first its because reddit is antithetical to true democracy looking through the supports there are many instances of people voting who have little to no interaction with this subreddit there were over comments on that thread literally hundreds were deleted for violation of any number of rules how can we know if they are voting in good faith so in the end we can only determine general feelings second it is because socialism already has a problem of being dominated by white men we as a sub have decided even if the brocialist kick and scream the whole way to try to build a community that isnt dominated by straight white men of the new mods of them are not straight white men where we have failed as others have pointed out there are a lot of marxists in this group quite a few of those are also leninist this was not purposeful we are not trying to exclude libsocs demsocs anarchists or ultras in that vein there are still two slots we have not filled these are only open to people from those tendencies if you are interested in nominating yourself or others to this please include all information that was included in the last along with your tendency please do so in reply to this post within the next hours now given that the average new mod had votes of support those who didnt averaged less than there were a couple exceptions to this those who got a lot of votes but were voted down for other reasons and i will discuss the one that is most obvious aprilmaria she wasnt really voted down but was voted to be delayed a lot of us on the mod team appreciate her and would like her to join the mod team the issue is that she has used problematic language in the recent past while some have pointed to cultural differences female moderators from the same culture were not comfortable with its usage either while she did agree to stop using it until there has been time to see that it was decided it was better to take a wait and see approach we have done this in the past with they were nominated by huge margins in past nomination threads but there was concern that their behavior on rfc might be brought here given time though it was abundantly clear that they were willing to abide by the rules of our sub and they are now a moderator in the end it is very likely aprilmaria will be a moderator adding moderators is not easy and it is not a process that ends when the nomination thread closes this was the first wave of additions we are always looking for people who represent tendencies and groups that are under represented that being said we will not bring on people just for the sake of it is the system perfect no its not but given the complexities of reddit its best we have right now
socialism,not_removed,congrats to the new mods let us hope we can achieve something tangible
socialism,not_removed,annnd the critical remarks have been removed as per usual
socialism,not_removed,thanks to everyone who supported me in the mod election i will strive to be a force for good on here as well as stopping the socdems from getting another chance at killing rosa
socialism,not_removed,thanks everyone ps readsettlersorg
socialism,not_removed,congrats comrades
socialism,not_removed,thank you for this opportunity comrades
socialism,not_removed,congrats to all the new mods
socialism,not_removed,congrats to new mods i guess but who won seems only tangentially related to who got the most votes more an application than an election
socialism,not_removed,glad to be here look forward to working with everyone improving the quality of discourse and keeping this a safe space for all comrades i thank you for the opportunity
socialism,not_removed,welcome new mods wish you the best
socialism,not_removed,congrats to the new mods do you know when the knew discord process will take effect i tried getting on there months ago but was unable to and the current link on the sidebar isnt working for me thanks
socialism,not_removed,congratulations to new mods readsettlersorg
socialism,not_removed,how did yall end up with an unironic hoxhaist as mod holy shit
socialism,not_removed,can we please see the method for which the votes were counted im surprised that almost all of the mods were mls edit i was apparently banned for voting wrong
socialism,not_removed,nice needed more infantile disorder though
socialism,not_removed,ive seen ucommunistpenguin on the discord and am eager that these new mods will help the sub out greatly
socialism,not_removed,decent folks all around subs in good hands
socialism,not_removed,thanks everyone congrats to the other mods
socialism,not_removed,nuyorican huh how familiar are you with the political and economical situation in puerto rico
socialism,not_removed,finally is mod lets make rsocialism socialist again
socialism,not_removed,does this mean a reset on discord bans or do i get banned from the sub for asking
socialism,not_removed,credit to click the top link on the page to get to the results
socialism,not_removed,congratulations to those who didnt make it and condolences to those of you who did if you didnt make the cut and are still interested there will be more mod elections and we are always looking for more help after you read modmail you will need help too
socialism,not_removed,thank you for this opportunity username redkiev are you cool with the rules i am but i also believe that a punishment should be based on the motive of the suspect everyone is an individual and should be treated as such why should i be on the staff i can get behind a lot of leftists schools of thought from anarchism to communism and believe that there is no one true leftist ideology i am against sectarianism and think that we all should have more patience for each other so we can understand why we believe what we believe we should focus on things we have in common and make compromises where we can together we can learn improve organize and achieve anything i work as a car mechanic and am part of several left wing groups as well as an union in ukraine i visit this sub every day for the past year and would like to help wherever i can
socialism,not_removed,i would like to re enter my application and see if im given the grace of a response this time im standing on the same platform as previously
socialism,not_removed,username are you cool with the rules definitely i as an anarchist oppose any form of hierarchy but i see that reddit where td has more than subs simply does not provide the tools for an open election free from brigading why should you be on the staff im am now a member of the antifa for years been involved in some big protests in central europe eg i hope many of you will be there in hamburg this year and plan on staying active on the streets in addition to that i would love to support this community by bashing the fash and keeping this community healthy is this the right word for that i dont know i have been a marxist for quite a while though in the early months of the last year somewhen around february i became interested in anarchism and its theory of absence of authority does anyone know a proper translation for herrschaftslosigkeit and i have ever since read a lot about it and discussed with my local antifa group i can only recommend all of you to think about anarchism too i am how of course every other anticapitalist leftist should do open to all other socialist ideologies too but i strongly oppose brocialism
socialism,not_removed,im going to be pinging those who fit the criteria for the mods positions who also applied in the original mod thread uredkiev uperfectsociety
socialism,not_removed,thank you to uragark and the other mods for this opportunity username perfectsociety tendency libertarian socialist who is an adherent to marxian economic theory i support a decentralized participatory planned economy are you cool with the rules generally yes i think inclusivity is very important for building a socialist movement and social justice is an important part of a proper modern socialist movement though i do think banning should be used more responsibly rather than reflexively as sometimes happens on this sub while trolls and others that are obviously detrimental to the discourse should be banned it is important for moderators to maintain a level of impartiality as much as possible and avoid abusing their power for banning out of ideological antagonism towards other forms of socialism or out of personal vendetta the majority of moderators i think have done a good job on this sub but there have been a significant minority of instances in light of recent events in which power was abused for often petty and counterproductive reasons moderators must avoid being emotionallycharged in their moderating activities and instead must utilize sound judgment consistent with the values of this subreddit furthermore there should be better communication between the moderation team and the members of the sub when situations like being brigaded arise that require swift and sweeping moderation to preserve the integrity of the sub members of this sub are members of our community and our members are entitled proper communication that does not leave them in the dark by the moderators as this sub grows it will be increasingly crucial to improve communication between moderators and members of the community this is something i would aim to do why should you be on the staff that is obviously for the members to decide however it would be an absolute pleasure to have a core role in the invaluable conversations discussions and arguments that occur in the socialist community and seeing as how this is the largest socialist subreddit having a role in moderating rsocialism will be integral in protecting growing and facilitating the socialist movement one of the reasons i would like to be a moderator is to ensure that proper communication as mentioned above occurs between moderators and members of the community like i said i think our members are entitled to clear timely and thorough communication especially in odd or problematic situations such as getting brigaded and while we get larger as a sub the importance of effective communication will only increase in addition to the issue of communication i would like to take an active role in voicing concern within the moderation team if regulations are proposed that target a particular subgroup of socialists for ideological reasons i think its important that as a socialist sub our moderators remain mostly impartial in moderating activity and proposition of new regulation to the various tendencies within marxism anarchism etc moderators should be careful not to use their power for the wrong reasons as someone who cares a lot about this issue i will voice concern within the moderation circle when such issues arise a huge goal of mine as a moderator will be to facilitate the expansion of the socialist movement of course with the right people so no compromising our values as that would be a mistake i believe the best way to do this is to ensure and encourage the continuation of genuine discussion knowledgeinformation sharing etc in a respectful manner consistent with our values of course my views on socialism i am an adherent to marxian theory of analyzing human society and economic systems i am also a supporter of parecon as the overall general form of socialism that i think should replace capitalism decentralized and democratic planning a few personal details i am a millennial the son of immigrants who came to america and i love politics economics history philosophy natural sciences environmental science anthropology and sociology im no where near an expert in any of those things but i love learning about them pineapple pizza i actually really like pineapple on my pizza no joke aside from pineapples though i often love to get alfredo sauce rather than the traditional tomato sauce for my pizza random but hey in case you wanted to know
socialism,not_removed,which female moderators are from my culture i wasnt aware of any
socialism,not_removed,username magikowl are you cool with the rules the rules seem fine to me more importantly i think moderator use of the rules has been pretty well implemented the growth of this sub and its ability to encourage intelligent discourse is a function of the moderators fair guidelines ive really enjoyed watching this sub flourish over the last couple months why should i be on the staff in terms of political ideology im a dem socialist i have experience with political campaigns on the local state and national level and im comfortable talking to strangers including those that strongly disagree about socialist policies in a positive way im dedicated to the cause of transforming the government into one that works for the people instead of normalizing society to the corruption that has made socialism a dirty word in this latestage capitalist oligarchy that means we have to start winning in both the court of public opinion and at the ballot box through grassroots political organizations like dsa im currently a mod of rjillstein rgreenparty and rsandersforpresident im fairly well connected in the leftist political realm and do my best to use that to further my ideals foremost among them being championing socialism and fighting for a political revolution id be happy to serve the community in whatever capacity is needed
socialism,not_removed,how can we know if they are voting in good faith would it be possible to restrict voting to those with a certain amount of karma in this sub that might be a good way to have true democracy while weeding out people who dont share this subs values
socialism,not_removed,youngbagelian was given a modship but hasnt accepted it yet
socialism,not_removed,it certainly appears nonmls were suppressed
socialism,not_removed,reason reactionary so does complaining about the moderator elections on a thread about moderator elections make one a reactionary now
socialism,not_removed,voteanimal had no influence on the election results—notice he wasnt modded either
socialism,not_removed,they say all wounds heal with time but they lie rip rosa tt

socialism,not_removed,i cant seem to find your elections
socialism,not_removed,a successful election wait elections the word for when you take votes but they dont really effect the outcome right
socialism,not_removed,i know april maria got dozens of votes no question and was a shooin for somebody that had support from both the proanarchist and proleninist sides deeply concerning to put it mildly
socialism,not_removed,congratulations
socialism,not_removed,its a long time coming finally we have an unironic bordigist in our midst
socialism,not_removed,nice one
socialism,not_removed,glad to see you got the job
socialism,not_removed,now
socialism,not_removed,send a message to rsocialismdiscord for ban appeals
socialism,not_removed,thanks friend
socialism,not_removed,pav i hope you help aim the sub towards socialist revolution and against reaction
socialism,not_removed,big ups pav
socialism,not_removed,well promesa and the court decisions have removed any pretense of bourgeois democracy being available in the colony the former has only exacerbated the crisis of pr as it has been loaned money it couldnt pay back due to deindustrialization due to manufacturing tax credits expiring there but state bonds being triple tax exempt privatizations price hikes and closures of public services outright has taken place anyone able to leave generally does so but those staying vehemently hate the state government the elected and appointed protests take place against the unelected appointments austerity and privatizations puerto ricans largely arent willing to completely break from the us as they see no alternative to being either a colony or holding out false hope of being a state havent heard anything about the pcp as of late working on that maybe they disbanded once again thats my extent of knowledge please correct me if im wrong
socialism,not_removed,of at least are not leninist
socialism,not_removed,combat liberalism
socialism,not_removed,not a blanket reset but if you were banned and want to come back please pm the mods at rsocialismdiscord
socialism,not_removed,strongly support i want more tolerant mods and hope you can bring good perpectives from eastern europe
socialism,not_removed,strong support
socialism,not_removed,i strongly support your platform of patience and understanding
socialism,not_removed,support
socialism,not_removed,oppose
socialism,not_removed,support ive seen you about on rcapitalismvsocialism and you do a pretty good job destroying ancap trolls in their own shitty clone sub of what was rsocialismvcapitalism keep fighting the good fight
socialism,not_removed,strongly support hope youll become a mod
socialism,not_removed,support
socialism,not_removed,support
socialism,not_removed,letthemtremble is our irish mod
socialism,not_removed,let them tremble is irish and el gato from the uk both strongly disapprove of the use of the word in question for sexist connotations though both come from cultures that use that word often
socialism,not_removed,support
socialism,not_removed,support
socialism,not_removed,no matter what we do its going to be arbitrary there are definitely people who have a lot of karma from yesteryear but now are reactionary there are those who have commentsposts that hit it out of the park yet arent socialist and worst there are people who are very much part of the community who honestly just dont post much just by virtue of how reddit is set up democracy is a pipe dream
socialism,not_removed,noted ill update my list blessed be your bagels
socialism,not_removed,i take it that uaprilmaria uredkiev and uzellfire and were also offered modships in that case because im having a hell of a time figuring out why they would be excluded on almost any measure one can shake a stick at given the vote support of the moderators that were selected
socialism,not_removed,one of the new mods didnt even publicly run and another received zero votes this shit is a fucking democratic party primary
socialism,not_removed,considering anarchists made up the majority tendency in the latest poll this is fucked
socialism,not_removed,oh im sure he had no influence since its not like hes friends with a large fraction of the existing moderators in much the same way that a good swath of the new moderators definitely arent rfullcommunism moderators edit riwaswrongallalong mostly
socialism,not_removed,i sure hope not considering he came in dead last
socialism,not_removed,congrats on not modding someone with like a vote ratio
socialism,not_removed,i mean its flawed and the author later said he got stuff wrong and hes super hyperbolic which is annoying but it makes some good points about how race works in america
socialism,not_removed,personally i think its a bit odd that there arent any large scale mlm parties anymore it used to dominate the leftmarxism during the civil rights movement and into the labour struggles and feminist struggles that came thereafter only one thats left is rcp and honestly they got some wildass cult of personality stuff to work outit seems to me more mlms fall into the local collectives form of organizing than anything else im not sure if this is more of a reflection of anarchism or an outright rejection of bourgeois democracy or maybe both but yeah definitely further discussion is needed
socialism,not_removed,that would be because i never nominated myself uanonsocialist can explain further ive expressed interest in modding in elections past but i never have nominated myself because i dont have access to reddit while working i used to and i didnt think my availability was up to par i was probably mistaken i was approached by the mods about becoming one
socialism,not_removed,thats what the word means where i live
socialism,not_removed,thanks comrade
socialism,not_removed,im literally bordiga danny devito
socialism,not_removed,thanks comrade
socialism,not_removed,thanks comrade ♡♡♡
socialism,not_removed,thanks i look forward to it d
socialism,not_removed,of the new ones in the op are explicitly leninists trotskyist ml mlm and the other are marxists who dont specify tendencies
socialism,not_removed,lol im so glad someone who said ultras should die is now a mod
socialism,not_removed,can i point out how offensive it is to imply any kind of equivalence between irish and uk culture i know youre not exactly making this implication but i just want to put it out there since it seems like ireland is pretty often marginalized in discussions of colonial oppression its basically like saying people in uk find this offensive so obviously if the same word is used in india it must mean something similar because india is basically like an extension of uk amirite
socialism,not_removed,didnt even know we had an irish mod i never saw her in any of the irish spaces never met anyone irl who was offended by it but fair enough
socialism,not_removed,yes i am so psyched for the success of the socialist movement curated by a small elitist group of autocrats who ignore the will of the people they purport to manage so they can persecute people for petty thought crimes
socialism,not_removed,because there are two levels of voting the subreddit elections puts forward who the subreddit wants and then the mods discuss each nominee and take a vote people who are active were given a higher priority people who use slurs were dropped people who called feminism identity politics were dropped poc and lgbt and grsm were higher priorities as well outspoken feminist and women as well etc while having a popular vote would be nice ultimately we have to work with new mods we wouldnt want another zerthimon
socialism,not_removed,and just as liberal
socialism,not_removed,its not like hes friends with a large fraction of the existing moderator to my knowledge hes not really friends with any of the existing mod team there is one moderator who has had a good working relationship with him and there is one moderator who is fond of his style but doesnt actually know him he has friends that were former mods but they left that a good swath of the new moderators definitely arent rfullcommunism moderators of the fc mods that applied were modded with widespread popular support and and were not modded characterizing of as a good swath is a bit much one of those two was very clearly the most widelysupported candidate and the other of those two had been helping us in significant ways behind the scenes for a while and been putting in work without actually being a mod here if anything your comment above strikes me as having a process which was incredibly strongly biased against the fc mods after all you didnt mention auraljuror supporters or cgraccus supporters instead leaping down to much less popular candidates to promote your narrative
socialism,not_removed,during the catgirl drama there was a petition against the rsocialism mods everyone on the petition was then banned from rfullcommunism
socialism,not_removed,yeah i mean mlm for me and trotskyism for you rcp is no longer mlm by the way
socialism,not_removed,i wish you luck in the moderating endeavor youve just found yourself in i hope the moderation team will get their act together after recent and semirecent incidents
socialism,not_removed,minus is so yes of the are leninist as such this shows that this person is factually wrong that they are all leninist
socialism,not_removed,haha what the fuck were you thinking theres no room for patience and understanding we need more tankies
socialism,not_removed,awh hopefully next time tho
socialism,not_removed,this wasnt a one to one equivalence but a demonstration that two people from cultures that use that word under similar justifications both reject its use with clear understanding of its sexist connotations
socialism,not_removed,while having a popular vote would be nice ultimately we have to work with new mods while im sure that whoever zerthimon is they were pretty fucking terrible i hereby move that the mod team be referred to henceforth as the electoral college
socialism,not_removed,i think its absolutely fascinating that identitarian categories were regarded as high priorities yet supportopposition ratios and ideological representation werent the latter is triply funny because anarchistslibertarian socialists were a plurality on this subreddit when the last census was done anyway whats the basis for shunning uaprilmaria who by my estimate had the highest number of support votes of anybody in the entire election the tired accusation of using slurs that she explained was a matter of cultural differences two levels of voting and favoritism for certain categories doesnt really explain anything about how the decision was made especially given that one potentially two depending on how one looks as it new moderator wasnt even a candidate in the election
socialism,not_removed,the subreddit elections puts forward who the subreddit wants so all this time we were nominating people for election by the mod team edit the comment i replied to was outlining how the elections work apparently the whole election we had was just a nomination process after which the moderators voted which clearly overturned in some cases what people actually wanted
socialism,not_removed,yo just checking is this a fucking joke
socialism,not_removed,characterizing of as a good swath is a bit much yeah i just noticed that actually totally my bad ill edit my post to reflect the error after all you didnt mention auraljuror supporters or cgraccus supporters instead leaping down to much less popular candidates didnt see them in my passthrough mostly because i was focusing on the candidates that didnt strike me as the sort that fantasized about banning their enemies left and right
socialism,not_removed,just with a grain of salt and keep a critical eye also it helps if you at least know marx before you read because if you dont know marx before reading then youll probably think its maoist worldist lit
socialism,not_removed,i know rcp isnt mlm anymore but they used to be and many of their members likely still are
socialism,not_removed,im new but working with the rest of the mods i have no doubt we can make the sub better
socialism,not_removed,of those in the op there are who are explicitly leninists the other unclear but all marxist this sub is like nonleninist and nonmarxist
socialism,not_removed,i know what youre saying and i dont think you did it wrong per se i just like to be over enthusiastic about pointing it out since its overlooked by the community cheers
socialism,not_removed,this is kind of an outrage what the hell has happened to my favourite sub
socialism,not_removed,ideological representation was taken into account otherwise wed have like new mlms so was popular support other than a few outliers our new mods all enjoyed widespread support as for april the cultural difference defense is not sufficient the mod team is willing to add her if she drops the use of the c word
socialism,not_removed,why would it be this is how mass mod promotions have always been at least since the mod team was completely emptied
socialism,not_removed,i just feel bad for the maoist members who have been convinced that rcp is the best place to be
socialism,not_removed,good to know
socialism,not_removed,taken from a survey that had no way of checking if respondents were actually users of this sub the raw data on those are unsettling to say the least because of the permissive nature of them and even taken at face value going by survey results would leave women poc and lgbt off the mod team because a lot of the users are straight white male and under
socialism,not_removed,leninist takeover
socialism,not_removed,ideological representation was taken into account noted that does succinctly explains why so many selfproclaimed anarchists are now on the moderator team for claritys sake the majority of us dont think that the difference between a runofthemill ml and an mlm is substantial enough to warrant the phrase ideological difference leninists can be grouped together anarchists can be grouped together social democrats can be grouped together and so on pretty sure i saw april mention that she was more than happy to drop the usage of the offending word and had already done so according to numerous comments either way flat out civility toward fellow posters is a much more important thing to focus on in my opinion and pretty much everybody else on the subreddit who speaks out in occasions like this
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,the manifesto is fine lol no need to read all of capital just for settlers and of course whatever you read being critical is key im not gonna act like its required reading for us leftists but its certainly interesting the author admits he got some things wrong so also keep that in mind
socialism,not_removed,i really doubt the altright is trolling here by misleading censustakers on the subs syndicalistmaoist balance
socialism,not_removed,i mean im a leninist but i still this is absolute bs
socialism,not_removed,they banned a leninist for taking up for april
socialism,not_removed,who knew that leninists were the most common tendency group
socialism,not_removed,leninist takeover by the people whove been modding the sub for nearly years
socialism,not_removed,not many anarchist applied i think the one i remember was vetoed due to reasons unrelated to being an anarchist trust me we do want to add more anarchist i even keep an eye out for them as for april she used the slur no more than days before the thread was posted its gotta be longer than that to show us shes serious but a month or two should be enough for that hatchet to be buried
socialism,not_removed,we currently have explicitly mlms
socialism,not_removed,yeah the mods here are absolute tankies and will never stand for a real election which is sad because i was hoping the sub would turn a new leaf
socialism,not_removed,democratic centralism means freedom in discussion a democratic decisionmaking process and then unity in action a fixed leadership caste who wield power regardless of popular discussion action or opinion is just reactionary
socialism,not_removed,if communizers are so prevalent on the mod team why is discussion on the ultra left virtually nonexistent or when it is its usually shit flinging from people who dont know what theyre talking about in regards to anything left of leninkropotkin i dont bullshit here but im pretty sure im the only person i ever see bringing up communization or posting communization literature here seems odd given such a supposedly high representation on the mod team
socialism,not_removed,mlms trots mls leninists unspecific marxists
socialism,not_removed,not many anarchist applied i think the one i remember was vetoed due to reasons unrelated to being an anarchist i was vetoed
socialism,not_removed,is she aware that youre conducting a tryout or is possible that she cant be bothered anymore because despite getting more votes than anyone her promise to so better wasnt seen as good enough edit the comment i replied to was about how the nominee in question used a designated objectionable slur again since the elections which i dont think is a good indicator of shit
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,me too comrade i was so pleased when i saw the original election post but it has been an absolute farce i cant believe the brazenness of it too
socialism,not_removed,mls had the most applicants by far we also ignored many of them as well or else half of the fc modteam would be mods look at the added mods only two are mls or variations of hell we added trots marxist feminist an ancom and a nonspecific marxist thats a pretty shit ml takeover
socialism,not_removed,forget anarchists of the full mods i dont even think theres a single nonleninist
socialism,not_removed,post it to shitliberalssay
socialism,not_removed,yea i wanted to comrade but for some reason that sub censors of my submissions for some reason whether by site bug or by mod intent
socialism,not_removed,ask uvidurnaktis about it
socialism,not_removed,the issue is that it happens for of my submissions literally anything i post
socialism,not_removed,its a bit of a mess its good but its chaotic and its more or less two songs being sung at once if it was more streamlined it would catch on here in limerick no problem
socialism,not_removed,you live in limerick
socialism,not_removed,county limerick im a half hour to from the city at present
socialism,not_removed,cool do people there know about the limerick soviet is it taught in schools
socialism,not_removed,people in trade union sort of families would its better known recently though there is more being done about awareness of working class history in recent years its funny because an online friend from russia sent me a picture of a boik about the limerick soviet written by an irish man but had been translated into russian asking me if it was real we dont learn it in schools communism and socialism are completely skipped over in history in school unless you do higher level and then its left a bit vague stuff like this and the rumours and legends surrounding it pass on trough generations of families its the same with the various protests and strikes trough the years although in recent years we have gotten better at gathering accounts of things before everyone involved are dead or senile
socialism,not_removed,a while back when they were still up i used a script to tag people with positive posts and comments in racist reddits like coontown and such i tagged quite a few posters this way now im sure many of those accounts were only for those reddits but many were not i see their posts everywhere worldnews and news are in infested with them i have also seen plenty on the anarchism and libertarian subs but not extremely often the donald is of course full of people i have tagged no surprise what i find interesting is the type of things they post these are people who on reddits of yore would talk about how certain groups were subhuman and such in the most disgusting ways now i see them taking the intellectual racist approach in so many comment sections they know what they are doing but i dont think it is organized who knows
socialism,not_removed,children hugging serving members of their family is not fascist propaganda calm down
socialism,not_removed,maybe fascism isnt the right word but it certainly does glorify imperialism
socialism,not_removed,in what way exactly
socialism,not_removed,returning soldiers are always made out to be heroes who fought for our freedom even videos that dont repeat that myth reinforce it anything that shows someone wearing a us military uniform is imperialist propaganda unless its subversive in an obvious way because myths about the military fighting for freedom have so deeply infested us culture
socialism,not_removed,returning soldiers are always made out to be heroes who fought for our freedom yes thats a common trope but thats not referenced in any way in these videos even videos that dont repeat that myth reinforce it thats not really valid in these instances anything that shows someone wearing a us military uniform is imperialist propaganda how is displaying someone in a us military uniform a promotion of imperialism it has no bearing on the nature of american wars across the world it makes no statement as to the validity of myths about the us and again intent
socialism,not_removed,how is displaying someone in a us military uniform a promotion of imperialism it has no bearing on the nature of american wars across the world it makes no statement as to the validity of myths about the us and again intent when americans see a us military uniform theyre taught to think hero and freedom fighter that kind of thinking allows imperialism to go largely unchallenged without having to justify any particular war if its not challenging that attitude or imperialism itself it functions as imperialist propaganda regardless of intent because it perpetuates a myth explicitly or implicitly that is the cause of much of the us populations support of imperialism
socialism,not_removed,mussolini is one of the biggest cowards of all time he was a socialist when he was a young man railing against wwi because he was drafted once mussolini got out of the military due to medical problems he quickly changed his mind and became openly and proudly prowar and proempire so he was an antiwar socialist when he had to fight and prowar fascist when other young men did the fighting for him
socialism,not_removed,that doesnt hold up under basic historical scrutiny the main reason for mussolinis ejection from the socialist party was his interventionism in a year before italy even entered the war and he seemed rather desperate to join before his class was drafted most accounts from commanding officers of him were positive and he was discharged with full honors after a training accident where grenade fragments embedded in his body i hate to be in a position to have to defend the founder of fascism but theres no point inventing reasons to hate a man whos already been well established to have been grotesque
socialism,not_removed,i got my info from the great war channel
socialism,not_removed,ive watched that video before and it doesnt say what you claimed in your post perhaps you confused mussolinis earlier desertion to switzerland in with his later service in the video mentions the kings amnesty and his mothers death which happened nine years before
socialism,not_removed,oh how about that it did welp my bad
socialism,not_removed,i am from quebec city lots of rightwing radio hosts spreading hate all the times fascist groups are brewing in the neighbouring military base valcartier as well thr subburbs of the city especially the south shore are one of the most rightwing in the province edit la meute is mostly a bunch of guys from the canadian forces who managed to get a lot of likes on facebook using a very populist stance about immigration and islam they then turned their popularity into a fascistic group id say the maximum number of active members is around facebook likes hardly count as membership soldiers of odin in quebec city is mostly the remains of the old neonazi black metal scene and neonazi skinheads probably members max atalante is from the same background as soldiers of odin but they embraced a more neocatholic white frenchcanadian nationalism less than members
socialism,not_removed,its not just this one fucking heinous attack all over the weekend there has been a huge increase in fascist attacks in montreal someone was shot last night and considering a fascist group was doing the rounds of bars looking for targets threatening death and such niceties at the same time it can very well be related this evening we had a guy threatening poc folks in a major street its fucking scary comrades we arent ready
socialism,not_removed,this is tragic i hope muslims in all western countries are getting support right now
socialism,not_removed,i live in montreal so this hits home especially hard solidarity to all muslim comrades at this time the left collectively needs to get its head out of its assand fast
socialism,not_removed,how many more people have to be butchered by fascists before liberals realise that free speech for fascists kills innocent human life is worth far more than their platitudes
socialism,not_removed,this this is why you dont let them speak you dont give them a platform you do not allow hate speech to be anything but an extreme social taboo the speech of fascists is violence it is not wanton word soup it is not a threat it is a promise fascists do not get a voice
socialism,not_removed,and i was kinda hoping it would be contained to south of the border but its happening everywhere my heart simultaneously bleeds and seethes
socialism,not_removed,even in canada its starting to spread past the border it hasnt even been two weeks since trumps election and it begins to bleed here sure we have trudeau and his sunny ways oh boy but we are going to have to keep an eye on the conservative party while they choose a new leader my condolences to my fellow quebecois
socialism,not_removed,this week has been shocking i dont know what i expected from a trump victory but it sure as hell wasnt as bad as this
socialism,not_removed,a deep farright sentiment seems to have been brewing these past year in the province of quebec which has been legitimized by some public and political figures along the way i feel as it is spreading fast i remember a bunch of fascists infiltrating an anticapitalist protest last year and ganging up on a comrade who got separated from the main the mob after the cops gased us he ended up in the hospital when you listen to what theyre saying there is no doubt for them muslims and leftist must be brought down we have to be wary if we dont stand united
socialism,not_removed,were killed and others injured two suspects arrested edit according to only one is a suspect lots of discussion to catch up on much in french but someone gave me this link which suggests a threat was posted on a wellknown board of bigots its unsettling and enraging httparchiveisuvnut
socialism,not_removed,can anybody explain exactly what is going on is this a extreme rightwing attack or is it done by islamic terrorists stupid question perhaps but in my countrys media they are just mentioning it as a terrorist attack and that the attackers yelled allahu ackbar before opening fire it is really unsettling if its the case that it was a farright group attacking and no real mentioning of it in the media
socialism,not_removed,im sad they look more organized than the left in quebec city
socialism,not_removed,among those groups we might add pegida quebec front national du québec ère nouvelle du québec and that new political party launched by bernard rambo gauthier citoyens au pouvoir seems to be heading in the same direction as the other groups when the most read printed journal of the province journal de montréal richard martineau and mathieu bockcôté keeps spinning farright narratives on a daily basis i fear we might see more of these tragedies
socialism,not_removed,the timing of this in relation to whats going on in the us right now also cannot be a coincidence far right wing terrorists being emboldened by the fact that the us is being lead by fascist right wingers in the midsts of a literal nationwide racist crackdown tends to unbalance already unbalanced people more
socialism,not_removed,as someone just across the provincial border i stand in solidarity with you comrade
socialism,not_removed,arm yourselves now
socialism,not_removed,and there are comments in the rcanada megathread calling fascism a left ideology i want to fucking scream liberal ignorance and pacifism is going to fuck us all again fuck
socialism,not_removed,theyre organizing openly now they used to stay in dark corners all the liberals do is fucking sing kumbaya and the left is not ready
socialism,not_removed,what does this mean exactly
socialism,not_removed,i work in an ontario town where reactionary spread like fire even us natives dont feel safe here there were talks from local fashes that when the time come they will put all natives in camp and exterminate everyone else
socialism,not_removed,well im expecting far worse before this is over
socialism,not_removed,rightwing québécois kid attacked a mosque shortly after prayers
socialism,not_removed,i cant speak to qc itself but the pcrrcp is very active in quebec
socialism,not_removed,source
socialism,not_removed,judging people based on their fucking names plenty of people with muslimnames are christians or nonreligious
socialism,not_removed,good fucking luck with that in québec
socialism,not_removed,rcanada is a shithole
socialism,not_removed,it means its time to organize and get militant and fast
socialism,not_removed,not wrong i have stopped assuming and realised the need to get more serious about my organising
socialism,not_removed,well fascists are literally patrolling streets without opposition in qc
socialism,not_removed,most national subreddits are pretty bad cough cough rbrasil cough the only ones i can enjoy are rnetherlands and rsweden
socialism,not_removed,really leave it to the authoritiesif you fight them theyll only up the ante and win
socialism,not_removed,same here comrade lets keep it up
socialism,not_removed,i believe you unfortunately
socialism,not_removed,if he is of moroccan descent and was born in quebec city he very probably isnt muslim sons and daughters of muslim immigrants here are not religious growing up in quebec kills religiousness
socialism,not_removed,translation alexandre bissonnette is now considered the sole suspect of the attack
socialism,not_removed,implying the authorities will side with us implying theyll lose if we simply do nothing thats not how this works thats never how this works
socialism,not_removed,we dont live in a democratic society where do you think you are
socialism,not_removed,but youre advocating violence selfdefense ftfy
socialism,not_removed,hopefully some of them will realize their lesson you cannot peacefully protest against a fascist government
socialism,not_removed,seen this movie before
socialism,not_removed,looks like they need to get weapons
socialism,not_removed,im sure they remember wounded knee
socialism,not_removed,fuck the obama administration fuck liberal democracy and capitalism
socialism,not_removed,so one operator was killed at least one third of the people killed were women and children likely noncombatants if anyone could even be called a combatant in the first place rather than just an assassination target and the helicopter that was sent to get them out was destroyed wow just wow kinda makes you wonder if their objective was to just kill everyone kids and all i mean it sounds unthinkable but this is the us were talking about
socialism,not_removed,this was happening constantly during obamas presidency remember the drones i am not here to apologize for trump but we must consider that this is more of an american imperialist thing than an trump specific thing
socialism,not_removed,begins its been happening for years
socialism,not_removed,who wants to bet that the liberals finally start protesting against ops like these we all know they didnt give a shit under obama but i bet they will now
socialism,not_removed,and so it begins continues
socialism,not_removed,you mean continues
socialism,not_removed,this just breeds more people to fight against the us whats the old adage an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind the us bombs people and their brothers sisters and friends take up the mantle all for it to repeat over and over whats the end result more death
socialism,not_removed,yeah i dont think people realize what obama built they have a meeting every week and they decide who to bomb know the person in charge of this is donald what are human rights trump god help us all
socialism,not_removed,oh i know begins continues under trump i mean
socialism,not_removed,as they said on tyt were about to see an antiwar movement again
socialism,not_removed,its not even an eye for an eye at this point its just indiscriminate slaughter america isnt even killing the people who took out its eye its just killing what america has done since is indescribably worse than
socialism,not_removed,and here i thought what you meant by begins was liberals holding trump accountable for things they didnt hold obama accountable for which ive already been seeing in spades lately
socialism,not_removed,where does it end my friend
socialism,not_removed,i dont know all i do know is that things will continue to get worse
socialism,not_removed,if anything this piece just shows how ignorant liberals are of anticapitalist theory the author absurdly claims that trump is an anarchist because he has no idea what anarchism is he doesnt know that anarchism is socialism without a state and instead equates it with right wing chaos the idea that a right wing capitalist blowhard like trump or his cronies are anarchists because they hate the weak neoliberal democratic party capitalist regulatory state and welfare is absurd hes confusing bootlicking right wing libertarianism with anarchism liberals have been embarrassingly misinformed in analyzing the procapitalism of trump and his cronies and this piece is reminiscent of how theyve been redscaring about how steve bannons nonsensical description of himself as a leninist is evidence that russsssiaaaaaa is trying to destroy america and they genuinely believe that putin and his cohorts are communists despite them being the most right wing free market capitalists in existence it just goes to show how much center right democratic party liberals hate socialism and its disappointing seeing this coming from bill moyers site who is one of the few american liberals that i genuinely respect
socialism,not_removed,donald trump the accelerationist
socialism,not_removed,absurdly this is the right word
socialism,not_removed,no hes one of those powerhungry anarchists that are so common and also are a thing s
socialism,not_removed,well horseshoe theory proved s
socialism,not_removed,i dont really think this is as big an issue as its made out to be most people dont literally blame all white people for racism to most people thats probably either a joke or an effort towards catharsis and we should be supportive of that tbh any white cis males who honestly think theyre being attacked personally by these remarks probably arent comrades in the first place
socialism,not_removed,i mean the oppressed groups who make those statements are making it because when you look at the crowd you have to face every day you dont know which cis people are the ones who are going to really really hurt you today theres no visible sign for trans people to continue the example example its a way to vent that we feel that the majority is against us its to cope plus many of these problems are institutional as a white person what i do has some small part in hurting people of color in america even if i dont wish it i a white trans man could get hired over a black trans man and there goes his ability to eat not my fault but i support his right to say fuck all white people because all white people are part of hurting him in that way i understand not wanting to alienate potential comrades and i say this as someone from the bible belt who is trying to appeal to his peers and rekindle the workers rights mood here but after a point you dont have the energy to devote every second to explaining that yes you get it some are not going to hurt you to be a marginalized person is to constantly constantly be swimming upriver and its a struggle daily
socialism,not_removed,i conpletely agree with this fighting for the rights of the oppressed is very important but not while also alienating the white working class which makes up a huge chunk of the proletariat in north america and europe we are never going to be successful as a movement if they arent on our side
socialism,not_removed,not saying you are one but its funny how many antipc folk are getting bent out of shape especially for a jokenot to say jokes cant be problematic but for such people its only shitting on minorities of different strokes thats acceptable
socialism,not_removed,feminism is just like socialism theres different types women have been oppressed for generations traded for sheep for marriage forced into even many people love darwinism for example but he had views on women that were very misogynistic sexist and destroyed much movement for women so many of us even in the west were told such bogus unhealthy things growing up thinking the abuse so many women endure the pain of neighbors hating women the thing with capitalism it doesnt respect women in nature i cant even get out of bed during my menstruation periods yet cant even obtain maternity leave at my work my job refuses to pay for my birth control and tampons are fucking expensive taxed i even have to drive hour oneway to pick up my birth control a month i was also a rape survivor well i was abducted and then raped and then abandoned right after whats sad is i was less concerned for my own health than i was for losing any college scholarships after a month or so i finally broke down and went to the dean of the school and he told me just to leave and if i wanted to continue with my scholarships i was trying to take a break to check into a mental institution for a few months said i had to see one of the schools premed psychologist for a semester before i could do anything and handed me about pages to fill out to send myself to a few different departments i couldnt as much hold a pen let alone sit and do all this bullshittery as a rape survivor i hate men all of them i have to because how else would i know which men are rapists do they wear i am rapist signs around their necks how would i know which guys beat women how could i possible even know he isnt going to be a serial killer or murderer even worse how could i know his views on women arent sexist why do i have to walk around at night in fear of men
socialism,not_removed,what video are you referencing
socialism,not_removed,no one actually thinks all white men uphold these things it just seems that people take it excessively personal when you mention white guys having a bit of an advantage
socialism,not_removed,i agree with you it is unfair to generalize and then criminalize any group of people you may find yourself grouping a misunderstood or uninformed person with genuinely ignorant people when you do that to people who feel threatened then you only make them more of an enemy
socialism,not_removed,good god you fucking liberal
socialism,not_removed,but sometimes it can sound more and more personal i know a lot of us arent like that but i remember being alienated by remarks of some feminists who ive met in real life for the same reasons it literally felt as if im also a perpetrator just for being born male edit i see feminism as a real struggle not a brocialist and i realize that not even a majority of feminists blame all men but im just voicing how i felt at that time
socialism,not_removed,yes this is an argument that i didnt consider before as i replied to another comment before i do understand better now thank you i shall not undermine the frustration and leave them voiceless meanwhile i hope more and more of us can unite under socialismanarchism
socialism,not_removed,yes i have seen racismsexism been wrapped in unfunny stereotypes and sarcasm all over the internet but one person stands to represent their marginalized group and you can find a shitstorm calling out sjw its sad really
socialism,not_removed,there should be a better way forward than to alienate half of our allies
socialism,not_removed,now that ive seen the video its actually not so bad and not that blamey is that a word point taken most liberals exaggerate complaints as hate for all nonmarginalized fellows
socialism,not_removed,your comment is not very constructive if you have any criticisms im willing to listen as you may see in the thread how does any view that doesnt stand in line with yours qualify as liberal
socialism,not_removed,same
socialism,not_removed,its sad and a little funny too tbh
socialism,not_removed,i myself dont like the video not because i was personally offended but because it was honestly poorly made lacked nuance and depth in its arguments although to be fair it was only seconds and the only purpose it seems to have been made was to garner clicks and controversy from reactionary pundits mtv like buzzfeed directly profits from videos like this and it arguably drives more people on the edge into altright camps there are far better ways to approach these sorts of discussions
socialism,not_removed,your comment is not very constructive fair enough how does any view that doesnt stand in line with yours qualify as liberal didnt say that kindly dont put words in my mouth if you have any criticisms im willing to listen as you may see in the thread alright here goes your comment is in line with a lot of liberal apologism not all men not all white people not all straight people not all abled people etc the problem is this is fallacious as all hell of course not all and of course responding with prejudice is not constructive but you dont solve anything with blame i may have altered the wording a bit by the time i got around to responding the op was deleted is equally unconstructive there is a definitive group of people who are knowingly or not complicit in the maintenance and benefit of oppressive systems
socialism,not_removed,thats a view i havent considered deeply thank you for pointing it out i agree with you though not completely we should welcome those who have nothing on their arsenal than generalized anger but also show them why supremacy patriarchy and homotransphobia are let to compound under capitalism add rationality to that mix hate patriarchy with a disdain for capitalism hate homophobes and transphobes with a burning rage for the police states that only stand for bourgeoisie constructs of freedom edit what im saying is capitalist ideology tries to use broken rationality to fight the justified hatred our responses could pass that bar while also uniting allies who are on the fence
socialism,not_removed,agreed thats why i said not so bad instead of good
socialism,not_removed,i will not understand the downvotes im with you white comrade p as a brown person sri lankan myself edit before downvoting realize hes not using that argument to be against social injustice unlike liberals
socialism,not_removed,okay not allowed apparently hmm cant see any such megathread so yeah
socialism,not_removed,even if state control of the local economy by a native elite can keep more of the profit generated locally for investment in the home country however the leftist fallacy is the assumption that this will enhance the position of the working class of that country rather than advancing the power of the local boss class in short the conflict between the industrialized countries and third world nationalism is a tug of war over the division of the total booty that is over the relative shares controlled by the bosses of the different countries the logic of the nationstate system is similar to that of competition in the sphere of production the worlds productive forces are divided into competing business organizations where each can survive only as long as its sales revenue is greater than its costs competition forces companies to constantly seek innovations that lower their per unit costs especially labor costs a company with greater resources will be much more likely to survive in the constantly changing world of market forces and attempts by competitors to take away their market share a company must pursue economic expansion to survive in such a world competition between nationstates has the same logic leading inevitably to the arms race that is technological innovation to enhance the destructive power that a state can bring to bear on the world scene dominate or be dominated is as much the logic of competition between nationstates as between businesses the imperialist tendency is inherent in every state the formation of new nationstates can no more put an end to imperialism than the formation of new businesses can put an end to capitalism the defeat of one empire in this or that region or the longterm decline of a formerly dominant power will not bring an end to the system of imperialism but merely facilitate the rise of a new empire or the rise of numerous miniimperialist tendencies with all the dangers of military conflict that implies
socialism,not_removed,false a colony can be a nationstate have a comprador bourgeoisie and being pillaged by an imperialist country leaving no way to the nationstate to be imperialist by basically being blocked in any case then its not the nature of nationstates to be imperialist but their surrounding conditions and dominant class whenever theres a more advanced country with the bourgeoisie in power its inevitable that sooner or later it will have an imperialist agenda
socialism,not_removed,wetzel uses imperialism in a different way than is traditionally used in marxism imperialism is monopoly capitalism capitalism at its highest stage lenin lists five defining characteristics of imperialism the concentration of production and capital has developed to such a high stage that it has created monopolies which play a decisive role in economic life the merging of bank capital with industrial capital and the creation on the basis of this finance capital of a financial oligarchy the export of capital as distinguished from the export of commodities acquires exceptional importance the formation of international monopolist capitalist associations which share the world among themselves and the territorial division of the whole world among the biggest capitalist powers is completed imperialism is capitalism at that stage of development at which the dominance of monopolies and finance capital is established in which the export of capital has acquired pronounced importance in which the division of the world among the international trusts has begun in which the division of all territories of the globe among the biggest capitalist powers has been completed most nationstates do not have these attributes nor is it realistically possible for them to in the foreseeable future many even have elements of precapitalism in the form of semifeudalism they just too undeveloped to do so some semicolonies can be expansionist or even be an colonizing oppressor nation in relation to anotherie sri lanka to eelam turkey to bakur mexico to the maya ect yet overall a semicolony in the world imperialist system some of the more powerful semicolonies like brazil india or south africa may one day become new imperialists but its unlikely that countries like east timor or swaziland are going to catch up to france or the netherlands wetzel is writing this from a firstworld perspective in which the struggle for a democratic revolutionary is a thing of the past i dont get how the opposition to national liberation which is a part of a democratic revolutiona prerequisite for socialist revolution in addition to the struggle against autocracy and for democratic demands seems to come from people from nations where its irrelevant yet he comes close to the truth at places a struggle to overthrow such authoritarian regimes could lead to new structures that are more responsive to popular concerns if there is a democratic process more freedom for workers to organize could result if a new elite doesnt merely consolidate a new form of authoritarianism however even in a situation where the overthrow of a usoriented autocracy leads to elected government and enhanced civil liberties this does not necessarily mean that genuine popular selfdetermination will be realized we can see this from our own situation in the us the relative freedom of speech and freedom of association of american workers and the freedom of opposition candidates to compete in elections doesnt mean the mass of american working people really control the destiny of this country were still a subjugated and exploited class the bosses really run things nonetheless it is true that these relative freedoms are worth fighting for indeed americans only have them because of the struggles of previous generations the real selfdetermination of working people in third world countries requires the development of worker movements that exercise independence in relation to boss groups and empower working people through internal democratic processes right to selfdetermination is part of a minimum programset of democratic demands to pave the way for the maximum program of socialist revolution for democratic revolutions in semifeudal semineocolonial countries the minimum program in the peripheral is for democratic revolutions led by the workers in alliance with the laboring classes particularly the peasantry it is not just against the imperialists but their local allies the landowners bureaucratic bourgeoisie and compradorbourgeoisie and the autocracies backed by imperialism you cant fight one imperialism without fighting the other semifeudalism and autocracy and yes it benefits other classes like the peasantry and there is a risk this wont be good for the proletariat just like there was a risk that the french revolution would lead to counterrevolution and the restoration of the monarchy the american civil war and emancipation of slaves would lead to jim crow or the fight for hour work days safer working conditions democratic rights and an end to child labor would be undone or simply move abroad but the liberation from imperialism and the autocracies it props up gives the proletariat breathing space to move uninterrupted towards the maximum program of socialist revolution and like any revolution there is always the risk of counterrevolution this may seem to have little relevance to people in dominate countries there is no need for a new democratic revolution in the us its imperialistcapitalist a bourgeois democracy no precapitalist hangovers the majority are likely proletarian and theres no peasants the minimum program would be to move straight to socialism but in countries where the workers are superexploited not just by their bourgeoisie but by imperialistcapitalists a significant peasantry facing exploitation by landowners precapitalist elements in productive relations and the superstructure and a corresponding autocracy to keep the workers and peasants the fight for a new democratic revolution takes on exceptional importance
socialism,not_removed,the formation of new nationstates can no more put an end to imperialism than the formation of new businesses can put an end to capitalism perfectly worded the left needs to get over the urge to think there is something noble in the actions of nations on the other side of the west vs all imperialist struggle the recent actions of china and russia show that given enough power any country would gladly act in the same way as the us does america isnt singular in its evil it just happens to be the most prevalent of countries at this point in time
socialism,not_removed,good nations exist only because of the blatant us imperialism same with ethical businesses theyre ethical because the market for ethical consumption was created by exploitation destruction of environment etc this applies to worker coops as well
socialism,not_removed,were better off without nationstates but surely it isnt controversial that some states are particularly destructive to humanity by an enormous margin relative to others
socialism,not_removed,look at maggie thatcher for example
socialism,not_removed,while bourgeois feminisms arent something we should be supporting im also peeved by how much hatejerking there is for it in this subreddit like this content doesnt deserve to be upvoted more than a tiny bit especially compared to some of the other stuff that should be it seems to me like its just people wanting to justify hatred of some feminisms but still appear squeaky clean to other leftists
socialism,not_removed,or merkel
socialism,not_removed,i agree but it may have something to do with pigdog clinton recent successes in the american election
socialism,not_removed,you make a good point i posted this article in the interest of having anything feministrelated get some discussion when so often its something that gets downvoted i think we definitely need to have a positive approach towards young people attracted to bourgeois feminism and identity politics because its often the first step towards a broader understanding of oppression we cant dismiss their concerns as bourgeois
socialism,not_removed,i see your point and definitely think there is some truth to this i also agree with uwatrenu though on my facebook feed most of this kind of content comes from a few marxist feminist women i know who are fed up with being told they should support clinton
socialism,not_removed,or melissa mayer
socialism,not_removed,yep shes really easy to hate and for good reason but what it seems like to me is that many people use her to let themselves get complicit with sexism
socialism,not_removed,yeah when people use sexist slurs in clinton hate sessions its time to call them out for it but i will never stop someone criticizing clintons appropriation of feminism for her goals
socialism,not_removed,i will never stop someone criticizing clintons appropriation of feminism for her goals im not asking anyone to stop just thinking a little and hopefully getting others to think about how the antiliberalfeminism hatejerk might be affecting the sub in general
socialism,not_removed,youre not wrong but i think topics tend to come and go in waves right now liberal bougie feminism is kind of at the forefront of a lot of news queen bey yaaas queen hillary lena dunham etc obviously a lot of the criticism is incredibly sexist lena takes the worst of it imo but its not a competition but its just super topical right now give it another month or two and the new topic will be something else i bet but right now its a really invidious issue where liberals actively suppress leftist thought and behavior by saying this is as far as feminism can go i dont think its accidental look at how popular feminism wed agree with is on tumblr and other parts of the internet theres an interest in keeping it as this weird insular stereotyped thing
socialism,not_removed,friggin prager u yeah dont pay any attention to those assholes its literally an online think tank that promotes an archconservative view of america and the world
socialism,not_removed,prager u is intellectually dishonest its purpose is to mislead its audience and nothing more
socialism,not_removed,prager u is a lobotomy in video form
socialism,not_removed,oh my fucking brain
socialism,not_removed,ya i looked it up because i was like what is this crap being targeted at me i assume it was because i was about to watch a video which was criticizing the demsclinton i hadnt heard that line of attack for brazil yet prageru is an educational website founded by conservative author columnist and talkshow host dennis prager in
socialism,not_removed,ikr i keep getting their ads for how well the israel is treating palestine
socialism,not_removed,with scarcity ending do we need a transition state a dotp has less to do with scarcity and more to do with understanding the point of a state and how it plays into class struggle since a state is the superstructure one class uses to rule over another the basis of a workers state is for the proletariat to rule over the bourgeoisie in order for class and ultimately the state to wither away a state is no longer needed if there is no class to oppress
socialism,not_removed,with scarcity ending do we need a transition state yes material abundance does not negate the class contradictions that form the basis of the state there may be enough food for everyone but the ruling class still own the means through which it is produced distributed and consumed the working class would still need to seize power from the ruling class and establish their own form of class domination ie the dictatorship of the proletariat in order to lay the foundations for communism and protect themselves from bourgeois counterrevolution
socialism,not_removed,tldr with scarcity ending do we need a transition state yes through your mechanistic technological analysis youve ignored what is the real prime mover of history the class struggle a transitional workers state is needed to wage the class war in a period of revolutions and counterrevolutions without it the revolution is defenceless
socialism,not_removed,yes because oppressive institutions still exist to enforce and support exploitation these require dismantling
socialism,not_removed,yes state socialism or the socialist dream of the century has failed
socialism,not_removed,so state socialism would act as a defensive measure until the revolution is secure
socialism,not_removed,yes
socialism,not_removed,this thread has been locked due to people defending nazis incessantly after this thread hit rall we do not tolerate nazi apologia antisemetic apologia or defenses of imperialism
socialism,not_removed,as a theatre major in the us i gotta say i want one of these shirts
socialism,not_removed,around about sounds like a yes song
socialism,not_removed,classic arts student
socialism,not_removed,this seems very much like messing about
socialism,not_removed,i had originally seen and sent this to friends through twitter one of them is an art teacher and really liked this is anyone aware where this could be purchased
socialism,not_removed,i thought it said ants at first and was confused as to why it was so specific
socialism,not_removed,can we get mods to ban capitalist apologists pls
socialism,not_removed,any other australians here should come check out raustraliansocialism
socialism,not_removed,communist archaeologist represent
socialism,not_removed,should be roddy piper in sunglasses but then it wouldnt work but it would
socialism,not_removed,me at the moment httpimgurcomabcdct
socialism,not_removed,slightly riamverybadass
socialism,not_removed,this shirt is simply advertising violence against anyone with an opposing political view its also an insult to the people who actually fought or survived the nazi regime i would say the person who trivializes something as serious and horrific as deserves to be on the front lines of the next war so they can grow old and watch kids wearing kitschy tshirts trivializing their battlefield opposition force
socialism,not_removed,i want to post this on my schools theatre alumni page but also most of the theatre people i know are liberals so idk if theyll find it funny
socialism,not_removed,music performance major here i concur
socialism,not_removed,youre my fave
socialism,not_removed,what does that mean in this context and why is it bad google isnt helping
socialism,not_removed,hey the shirt was made by a student union in aus there arent that many so they arent being sold online
socialism,not_removed,maybe they study
socialism,not_removed,please report anything you see as capitalist apologism and we will take care of it
socialism,not_removed,if its anything like aussie rugby i imagine its pretty extreme
socialism,not_removed,especially if you recall indiana jones in raiders was mainly using his whip against poor brown people
socialism,not_removed,riamaninsufferableedgelord
socialism,not_removed,saw two dozen nazis trying to intimidate a left wing councillor rushed them with two hundred leftists punched one a number of times no fucking nazis on our streets
socialism,not_removed,no its not its advocating violence against people who would literally commit genocide if given the chance if you think thats a legitimate political position to hold and defend that says more about you than it does about them
socialism,not_removed,implying art isnt important or worthwhile enjoy your netflix shows and movies you philistine
socialism,not_removed,yeah sad isnt it letting fascism fuck their countries while they sit about and watch in awe
socialism,not_removed,except fiction
socialism,not_removed,democratic peoples republic of korea names dont mean shit policies do
socialism,not_removed,what
socialism,not_removed,nazis arent socialists unless you have absolutely zero grounding in history and economics and are a giant dingus come on you can do better than that
socialism,not_removed,nothing to lose go for it
socialism,not_removed,yes yes it does
socialism,not_removed,maybe spend your time bootlicking some capitalist for wages instead of wasting your time on reddit trying to convince people to do shit they dont wanna
socialism,not_removed,look at how much ill let you exploit me ill give up on all my dreams try to replace that hole inside with owning things because thats a healthy approach
socialism,not_removed,le stem
socialism,not_removed,yeah nah piss off mate thats some bourgie bullshit
socialism,not_removed,alt right troll account found
socialism,not_removed,messing about see also messing around
socialism,not_removed,its not bad
socialism,not_removed,tell them to make more no joke id buy several no please really i really need one
socialism,not_removed,ok i figured as much but just wanted to double check very cool shirt thanks for the response and good luck with school 👍👍👍
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately socialism is in a pretty dire state in aus the national motto of shell be right mate leads to a lot of apathy the farright are resurgent electorally and the organised left is anything but the best thing we have going on at the moment is pretty big turnouts in cities like melbourne to protest things like invasion day australia day which is meant to be our national holiday but is on the day the first fleet of settlers arrived in australia so closer to columbus day
socialism,not_removed,what like talk a big game then get trounced by your smaller island neighbors kiwi rugby is best rugby mate
socialism,not_removed,whats wrong with netflix shows and movies
socialism,not_removed,some people in australia on the left think their sole mission in life is to go after socialist alternative the australian org no relation to americas salt for whatever reason were trots we dont think student movements should just be slaved to workers movements we dont really do anything around animal rights were antizionist were derived from the ist etc etc pick a reason someones attacked us for it
socialism,not_removed,except for your chains
socialism,not_removed,a fairly far left leaning aussie friend of mine lives fairly close to me here in japan he was going on about the other day how it was illegal for news to report on migrant boats accidentswhatever is that true i cant find much about it but seemed horrifying
socialism,not_removed,i marched at invasion day marches a few years ago that had people at them now its pretty regular for a few thousand to march things might not be great but the mass resistance we see in america can also occur in australia
socialism,not_removed,i have actually punched a nazi i recommend it if that makes me a badass im cool with that
socialism,not_removed,insight yeah deep maybe turn down the smugness a little and try to educate yourself instead
socialism,not_removed,point to me people who have been incorrectly called nazis and then been attacked then ill actually consider that a valid point
socialism,not_removed,nothing i was making fun of this poster for most likely enjoying art while simultaneously decrying it as unimportant and worthless
socialism,not_removed,im not necessarily saying that studying art is a great financial opportunity but to say that art isnt important or a worthwhile pursuit is silly
socialism,not_removed,physics isnt important because not every physics student successfully publishes a research paper doesnt really work does it
socialism,not_removed,oh shit they put socialist in their name shit i guess that means they must be socialist since words are inalienable and theres never been any situation where anyone has changed the meaning of something to mislead and distort something except the nazis literally did that with the swastika nazis lie national socialism if we take a bit of context is a total oxymoron honestly mate political parties lie all the fucking time if you actually believe the nazis were socialists because their name has the word socialist in it youre not paying enough attention and youre also deliberately ignoring the wider context they killed all the socialists and communists first for goodness sake
socialism,not_removed,you socialists argue again and again that labor is innately exploitative when in reality taking shit from people you dont know for work you didnt do is the real exploitation but this is like the definition of what capitalists do though you took one of the main arguments against capitalism and somehow twisted it in your head to mean the opposite of what it actually means
socialism,not_removed,you havent seen enough films if you really think that american films exemplified by hollywood blockbusters are the best
socialism,not_removed,the media isnt banned from reporting about it but the government says they are military operations so they dont release any information the media is banned from going to some of the offshore detention centres
socialism,not_removed,thats not true at all i have no idea what your friend is talking about i live in australia
socialism,not_removed,out of curiosity doesnt condoning the violence of others for their opinions make you more similar to a nazi wouldnt you rather nazis be out spoken so you know who to ignoredebate suppressing free speech like that is very nazi like not to mention in some cities a felony here from all not socialist but enjoy seeing discussion
socialism,not_removed,but muh stem s i am a huge maths nerd and i yet i will never stop ridiculing stemworship
socialism,not_removed,if you have any legitimate criticisms ive not seen them and thats not to say none exist but the rest of the farleft in oz is from my perspective basically uselessdead as a member id be interested if theyre not just dipshits calling us a cult like ive seen before sa is predominantly attacked for bullshit reasons like selling papersrunning stalls at rallies run by organisations hostile to us ive personally been called a racist colonialist because one relatively rightwing aboriginal organisation didnt like us doing that which is hilarious hence my comment it was never intended to shield us from criticism just the general crap we get
socialism,not_removed,not the worst either especially in production value costumes editing and special effects and therere always exceptional ones in plot thrill and acting also pretty unrivaled at catering to the lowest common denominator
socialism,not_removed,it is not strictly true but come on nauru and manus island dont give visas to journalists in most cases and ithe government regard refugee arrivals in a military sense on water matters and dont report on it which is risible in and of itself its also fact that there are gag orders on all personnal that work on those island camps speaking out about self harm rape child abuse or the horrific conditions there can land you in court or even in jail its not illegal to report on but they do a fuckload to hide the atrocities and obfuscate the truth
socialism,not_removed,people are being a bit dismissive here so i guess ill give you an actual answer basically free speech is good and all and quite obviously we should see what other people have to say and respect difference in opinion the problem is that nazism is not just a mere difference in opinion nazis call for extermination of races if nazis could listen to logic they wouldnt be nazis so you cant just debate them its not like you personally have to go out on a crusade and destroy every nazi you see but at least if you can see why some people feel inclined to do so thats all we ask
socialism,not_removed,no not wanting a nazi to speak doesnt make me a nazi logic how does it work
socialism,not_removed,short answer no long answer
socialism,not_removed,lol fuck off
socialism,not_removed,yeah i picked physics because everyone can see that physics is important and stem is important but the idea that everyone who doesnt do stem has somehow screwed up is absurd personally i am going into stem because its something i enjoy but if i preferred a different career path i would happily pursue it and i dont think that would be a mistake i suppose some people cant see how its possible that stem simply doesnt appeal to everyone
socialism,not_removed,communists capitalists dont create anything they take from the people who create claim it as their own and then take the credit ftfy you just described capitalism you have a very warped view of reality you keep describing the problems with capitalism and then nonsensically attaching them to the big bad boogeyman of communism all of your comments are arguments against capitalism
socialism,not_removed,true i mean some of my favourite films are american whats not to like about qoyanisqaatsi best american movie if i might say
socialism,not_removed,how you expect me to be serious when all you do is be arrogant and obnoxious is beyond me crawl back into your isolated liberal bubble and circlejerk there ive got nothing else to say to you
socialism,not_removed,my husband has worked jobs as a government employee and as an employee for a private company doing similar jobs and the private job was infinitely worse it very nearly broke him he was expected to unsafe and unethical things every day and he worked many many more hours the pay was better but the benefits were next to nonexistent youre being exploited either way and it sucks either way but if all else were similar id take the government job it is hard to put it on a scale since it all sucks but thats what ive seen
socialism,not_removed,thank you for sharing
socialism,not_removed,give em hell comrades
socialism,not_removed,coming to town for the opening of his new hotel oh yeah the president owns a hotel in another country no possible fucking conflicts of interest there
socialism,not_removed,wish i were home give them a warm welcome expect a blm turnout
socialism,not_removed,go canucks
socialism,not_removed,short summary the nazis and fascists who had declared they were coming to the suburb with force and terror to shut down an antiracist rally had been comprehensively beaten pushed off the streets the fascists had planned to march down sydney road instead their rally of was cornered blocks away as they were repeatedly taken on by a growing crowd of antiracists only a large and violent police operation to protect the fascists saved them from an even more ignoble fate as it was their rally was broken up and they scampered away as hundreds of antiracists chased them through carparks and sports fields and the role of the state and its apologists in denouncing those who confront fascism the media will as always slander those who are prepared to stop fascists marching in the streets the sunday herald sun ran a front cover and fourpage spread denouncing street warfare and condemning the left and right equally it is a funny thing when the left marched against us wars in iraq we were accused of appeasing what we were told was the centurys version of hitler saddam hussein when we protested against draconian war on terror laws or defended the palestinians we were told we were appeasing the new islamofascism but when we stand up against actual fascists – bona fide admirers of adolf hitler – and say they should not be able to spread hatred fear and violence on our streets we are condemned to high heaven actual fascists it seems are the only people the right wing media think the left should appease
socialism,not_removed,if you dont mind i xposted this to rislamicleft hopefully to get a discussion going on general muslim activism against islamaphobia and how we muslim socialists fit in
socialism,not_removed,and yet the media portrayed this as who is worse the upf or the socialists who want to shut down free speech and horseshoe was thrown around everywhere the media also likes to pretend the upf arent actual neonazis for god knows what reason despite they have swastikas tattoos ss runes and are linked to golden dawn
socialism,not_removed,bash the fash
socialism,not_removed,of course comrade the presence of muslim and arab youth there to smash the fascists was a glimmer of hope in the void of australian islamophobia its also proof that when the left takes a lead it can inspire and rally members of oppressed minorities to a fightback against racism
socialism,not_removed,i think you fit very well
socialism,not_removed,fucking channel presented a news report on them a while back as just a concerned group of aussie mums and dads the australian state and media organs continue to show their utter complicity in facilitating fascist violence
socialism,not_removed,i havent seen grave desecration this bad since i heard there was an entry fee to marxs grave
socialism,not_removed,eastwoods chair obama comes to mind
socialism,not_removed,why the rage i think anthony would be proud of hillary clinton if not that it took so long if someone insists that this automagically makes everything better for women everywhere thats when to hit that person over the head with a clue stick
socialism,not_removed,please elaborate he looks just fine to me
socialism,not_removed,do i need to show my iww red card
socialism,not_removed,sounds like a symbol which serves the purpose i described earlier
socialism,not_removed,i thought that user was a man
socialism,not_removed,gtfo liberal troll
socialism,not_removed,ill bet you felt good for a moment
socialism,not_removed,and why is that a problem
socialism,not_removed,wow seriously stop making assumptions they lead to prejudices
socialism,not_removed,yep he just got back to me he is indeed a man si is your liberal hissyfit over yet
socialism,not_removed,in what world does me a woman assuming a faceless nameless user called whoom im pretty sure said he was a guy before unless im mixing them up with someone else to be a man lead to predjudices just to settle this are you a man woman or neither and while we are talking what problem do you have with criticising liberal grave desecration of all things
socialism,not_removed,it doesnt matter except the only thing that matters is you being right is your liberal hissyfit over yet you really dont want socialism to ever be accepted i see that you just want to be the angry young mansic the only reason you claim the moniker is because you hate yourself and need the validation of everyone hating you youre not special youre just like everyone else
socialism,not_removed,i a identify as male
socialism,not_removed,wow rsocialism has been emptied of socialists i guess i should give up on it too
socialism,not_removed,heh you give me shit for calling a man he but call me an angry young man when im a woman thats fucking hilarious no pet nobody hates me off of the internet communists arent outcast and lynched in many parts of the world im not american now fuck your straw manning what problem have you with us criticizing the democratic party for grave desecration
socialism,not_removed,thank you for replying
socialism,not_removed,please do if by socialist you mean people who think the democratic party erecting advertisments in a graveyard is socialist
socialism,not_removed,you give me shit for calling a man he but call me an angry young man when im a woman thats fucking hilarious i see you dont know what sic means and are too lazy to find out youre not special youre just as arrogant and ignorant and refuse to be a socialist like so many in this sub do the world a favor and lurk not vomit until you can understand right from horribly wrong
socialism,not_removed,haha sounds like a slightly deeper version of its five oclock somewhere thanks people tend to write off country music these days because of shit bro country and its their loss for other alienated country music id check out george jones small time labouring man albeit a little less wistful
socialism,not_removed,a lot of the country music ive encountered is about working hard sucking it up and loving the good ol us of a very religious very conservative sort of stuff so i found it interesting that this song talks about going anywhere but work about avoiding reality about not having to be himself until monday reminds me of tons by tennessee ernie ford about a coal miner some people say a man is made out of mud a poor mans made out of muscle and blood muscle and blood and skin and bones a mind thats weak and a back thats strong you load sixteen tons and what do you get another day older and deeper in debt saint peter dont you call me cause i cant go i owe my soul to the company store
socialism,not_removed,the older stuff and the irish stuff is better its becoming a republican party propaganda tool in america i listen to country and traditional constantly at top volume when im working tipparary mid west radio ftw and i cant fucking stand any of the modern american country they dont even air it here generally its not well received i assuredly embarrass the rest of our irish comrades no end by being such a stereotype but such is life i guarantee you that there would be massive go for socialist country music if anyone would do some
socialism,not_removed,i need some outside confirmation of his claims im not seeing any stories about a girl being shot
socialism,not_removed,you wont find anything other than lies and propaganda the liberal media is only going to concoct something ridiculous to excuse this if not cover it up completely
socialism,not_removed,this is a little confusing it appears amazon has not actually released any voice data yet just the account information for the suspect the police have the physical echo device but that probably doesnt contain any voice data on its own because all the voice processing after the activation word is done on amazons servers amazon claims to be waiting for a legally binding document but what would that entail this is certainly scary but i dont think a precedent has been set yet
socialism,not_removed,looks like sol could be taking a turn away from and other apologies lets hope those few mentions of business are the last they broadcasted before going fully automated checked and they are calling their work playlist now workcapitalism they just might be waking up neat
socialism,not_removed,i have never seen a lampooning like that whooboy
socialism,not_removed,things have died down for a bit because trump is not president yet i do think that things will turn up again once the inauguration occurs also i was at a standing rock protest yesterday and there were lots of people there felt very empowering
socialism,not_removed,mass protests with masses of disappointed liberals what did you expect really there was not much organizing involved besides sa which is tiny and the goals of the protests were always nebulous besides protesting against the election result which will be implemented by the state anyway there was no chance from the beginning that this would develop into more than a very short brush fire of a movement
socialism,not_removed,theres one tomorrow against bannon at harvard things will start heating up after new years
socialism,not_removed,a lot of leftists are saving up their resources and energy for january the day when trump will inaugurated
socialism,not_removed,one against pence happening in nola this weekend hes speaking nearby
socialism,not_removed,no the military didnt shut them down i think things shifted from pure protest to people beginning to organize more and get involved in activism ive seen signs that membership in lots of leftist organizations is booming and the fight for demonstrations were happening today too the left is starting to get organized and band together i hope
socialism,not_removed,there are still protests and actions being planned in philadelphia
socialism,not_removed,solidarity the struggle is not a one and done
socialism,not_removed,wish i was there shame id have to cross the atlantic to join
socialism,not_removed,to be fair though most socialist uprisings began as protests while i never had faith that this would escalate to full blown revolution overnight i had dreams and dreams are inherently unrealistic
socialism,not_removed,ive heard cant wait to see the results
socialism,not_removed,any orgs spearheading it would like to readwatch some coverage
socialism,not_removed,i think we all hope especially in dark times such as this any numbers andor sources on membership booms btw curious
socialism,not_removed,never claimed it was tho but solidarity is always there whatever the conditions are
socialism,not_removed,whats more percent of protesters at one protest hadnt even voted this is fucking ridiculous it really isnt both candidates were bad for the working class women and minority so why should hey vote for them real change wont happen through voting in the capitalist state i agree that the hillary supporters are often really hypocritical though
socialism,not_removed,hypocritical noone here are hillarysupporters we all adamantly oppose her besides there were many socialist groups albeit not very large ones organising many of the protests
socialism,not_removed,i wish i could go too dont want to be a burden on the people there there are thousands of people there can be more effective at home
socialism,not_removed,there are several groups involved its a bit chaotic and wordofmouth at the moment
socialism,not_removed,httpstwittercomlarrywebsite has been talking about the things hes seeing on the ground as a dsa organizer scroll through his feed theres some good shit in there
socialism,not_removed,well i disagree on that more people will always helps the cause although of course its easier to be of help if you have had previous contact with some of the organisers if you physically can help i definitely urge you to if not there are other ways i myself would be more worried if my privilege would be damaging to some of the efforts not hugely but enough that id be doubting my role there
socialism,not_removed,in regards to the final part of your response the native speakers at the event have been saying that there are probably more non natives there than actual natives kind of an accidental colonization of the camp i would like to go but i think i could help at other activist places there is a camp in montana that is protecting buffalo that needs people that some of the speakers spoke about gonna have to remember the name but it seems interesting
socialism,not_removed,people walking past a dead body on the street

socialism,not_removed,i dont like what he is on about in the beginning how can you say that we are not living in a capitalist society thats playing into the hands of free market fundamentalists we are most definitely living in capitalism
socialism,not_removed,hes saying we dont live in propertarian fantasy lands of free markets where the raw mechanisms of the market dictates where goods and services are distributed without any outside interference we do live in capitalism but we dont live solely through the guiding hand of the free market so hes correct in that regard i think the major point is that we dont live under true free market capitalism because its just completely unstable and would end in workers revolting against their corporate overlords pretty much immediately so tldr hes calling statefree capitalism a fairy tale
socialism,not_removed,i figured he was making the point to combat the common myth that free markets are naturally stable and fair and need no regulation
socialism,not_removed,what ive noticed with americans in particular due to decades of propaganda they are so scared of anything that is not considered capitalism i think what he was trying to do is to point out that america is not fully capitalist after all and to try and disarm the anti socialist predudus every american is brought up with asking the question if capitalism is so good why doesnt its advocates the political and business elete introduce full blown capitalism says a lot about the whole thing in a real capitalist society you would need to purchase crime insurance or you couldnt get police assistance without paying a fee this fee would be more than just what the government pays for a police service it would also need to include a profit for the police share holders if a criminal was not profitable to the companies they would be allowed free would it be worth paying thousands every year just because some poor fucker stole your tv kill the fucker if you were a victim of a crime you would need to pay for the criminal to be kept in prison various different prison companies would compete for the cheapest possible rates leading to terrible prison conditions low security and high execution rates the state would not be allowed to interfere with minimum standards schools would no longer teach a standard curriculum instead they would concentrate on the easiest possible subjects ensuring a high graduation rate at a low cost
socialism,not_removed,hes referring to what most people think capitalism means the laissezfaire system of free markets of course we dont have that hes saying it cant exist in any case because capital depends on a strong central state to enforce its control hes making a distinction between the fantasy of capitalism found in textbooks as compared with really existing capitalism what we have is really existing capitalism and it doesnt bear any resemblance to capitalism the fantasy thats presented to justify the system its not playing into the hands of free market fundamentalists because he makes the point immediately that their system cant exist anyway because it would self destruct in five minutes i think he said capitalism cant exist without state power hes debunking the ideas of the free market fundamentalists more
socialism,not_removed,he equates capitalism with a laissezfaire system he says that in his video on youtube called why you cant have a capitalist democracy and some other places as well he calls whats usually called capitalism state capitalism which shows the relationship the state has in maintaining the economic system if you look on the participatory economics website they actually use the term state capitalism in this way as well
socialism,not_removed,noooo thats just crony capitalism maaaan
socialism,not_removed,no shitposting
socialism,not_removed,do you think there could be room for a muscular socialist to make videos about socialism my thinking is that brocialists are ultimately preferable to altrighters especially if they can be convinced that an essential part of masculinity is respecting women as human beings so working out means being a brocialist now
socialism,not_removed,i think youre focusing too much on the person presenting and not the content itself if a person is critiquing capitalism it doesnt really matter whether they are male female gay straight have big arms or small arms what matters is that they say something correct and substantial so go ahead and make a socialist show with muscular guys because the identifier of muscular men doesnt matter to the content at all
socialism,not_removed,ill admit that i can kind of see what you are saying i have seen women and minorities absolutely shredded and hunted down for saying half of what i say on a regular basis i dont think the issues is with there not being muscular men on youtube its plain old sexism and racism just another women being a sjw lulz or victimwannabe race baiter are common attitudes i feel just make sure if your not among these groups like me to backup your allies and friends i have noticed that other white people tend to agree more if they think other white people agree with it its unfortunate thats the way the world works currently but its something we have to contend with
socialism,not_removed,well while some of your rhetoric could use some critique which i can already see in the rest of the comments is well under way i dont think your idea is entirely without merit there is almost certainly a host of fencedwelling potential comrades that might be more receptive to our message if it were delivered by someone such as hopefully after some introduction to leftist political economic theory they would be more receptive to the broader idea and less reliant on bourgeois conceptions of femininity vs masculinity and be capable of learning further from other revolutionaries
socialism,not_removed,if muscular people want to make videos go for it dont see the need to promote that specifically though were not about reinforcing masculinity especially the toxic kind
socialism,not_removed,i dont think the golden one and vegan gains are people anyone should be mimicking the idea that attractive people are more influential is common sense though
socialism,not_removed,maybe completely off topic sorry just thought this might belong here
socialism,not_removed,primarily for satire
socialism,not_removed,muscles and masculinity dont really have anything to do with each other
socialism,not_removed,nah its a good idea of late ive been thinking of making a socialist alex jones show because theres tonnes of alt right conspiracy shows but not one leftist one
socialism,not_removed,brocialist is turning into the new hipster
socialism,not_removed,no making masculinity a central part of your politics makes you a brocialist
socialism,not_removed,i understand the point though politics is a dirty business we wont convince most people simply with just good logic unfortunately i think the biggest problems radicals have is that the concepts are complicated and not very accessible to most of the earths population
socialism,not_removed,not gonna lie thats an atrocious idea wild conspiracy theories almost always have a racist subtext and always benefit the status quo by blaming imaginary cabals of allpowerful and often jewish individuals for the problems of capitalism rather than the system itself invest your time into studying and understanding capitalist reality instead
socialism,not_removed,conspiracy theories are for people who know something sketchy is going on but have not read marx
socialism,not_removed,just wondering why you think this is a good idea at all
socialism,not_removed,is there a valid way to intersect masculine identity and left politics edit male masculine
socialism,not_removed,vegan gains is a reactionary fuck have you seen his videos unrelated to veganism you may be right about men respecting masculinity but in this context were getting toxic masculinity instead of healthy masculinity which cant be useful to socialists
socialism,not_removed,punching nazis seems pretty masculine to me
socialism,not_removed,lol a communist please show me where he has said that
socialism,not_removed,well i dont believe you without a citation anyway actions are more indicative of ideology than words he is your typical anti social justice neckbeard akin to sargon of akkad
socialism,not_removed,i doubt he has good reasons to call himself a communist it would be more convincing if he ever talked about socialismcommunism outside of mentioning that he was one once if vegan gains is really a communist he is the worst case of a brocialist ive ever heard of
socialism,not_removed,its really pathetic when vegans buy into the whole antisj thing and its particularly bad when they have a large following like vg is probably the antithesis to vg but she only has followers
socialism,not_removed,socialism advocates for workers control over production liberalism does not
socialism,not_removed,class class class
socialism,not_removed,liberals are capitalists and tolerate fascism because freeze peach
socialism,not_removed,liberals believe capitalism can be reformed and cant escape the contradiction that they believe capitalism despite its flaws is the best we can do socialists believe a better world is possible one based on a democratic economy designed for human need rather than private profit for a capitalist class
socialism,not_removed,liberals think that oppression is somehow liberating if its a marginalized person doing the oppressing eg hillary clinton additionally liberals think everything occurs in a vacuum free of pesky material conditions and whatnot
socialism,not_removed,dont necessarily see how this is good news i mean sure its nice to know that this kind of city planning is possible but i feel like this might lead to more sinister ends like giant walled encampments were the rich hide behind growing their own food and water without needing to ever leave and having robots protect them or something i guess this is good news for anybody trying to start a commune or something but you cant establish a socialist society through that so i dont really see the point
socialism,not_removed,i posted this because it shows that a socialist society where we have the technology to create efficient communities with little labor to maintain it is possible pretty much saying this is why we need socialism not capitalism in direct response to your comment i did not even think of the dystopian side of this holy shit thats pretty terrifying
socialism,not_removed,mao is far more ambivalent a figure than many of these comments suggest amartya sen a harvard economist and by no means a communist sympathizer found that commune leadership and ontheground healthcare in the crisis years of during and after the glf saved about million lives relative to demographically similar famines in india and china before mao which famines were endemic in china before mao and china suffered a total of one after which was of comparatively moderate size sen democracy and freedom the movement of doctors and educators to the countryside equalized education in a way that other policies could not and is a big reason todays china has high test scores and produces the labor force that it does although modern china in and of itself is ambivalent same could be said for back to the countryside policies during the cr we also forget that although the crisis years hit deep growth was restored to in each case in no more than a year how else could a country that looked like well a giant somalia in become dengs china by the the country was industrializing at the a year which is exactly how fast on average its converting to a service economy under the capitalist reforms this happened in eight out of the ten years the cr was in effect gao mobos book the battle for chinas past goes through a lot of this there was certainly undue and unconscionable violence and destruction during the cr a lot of that was a result of rebels and red guards literally being teenagers and acting like teenagers and that had to be reigned in by official policies but the idea that the cr was a directed purge carried out at maos whim is overly simplistic joan robinson cambridge economist and former teacher of sen has written a lot about both the macro and microeconomics of the cultural revolution specifically the communes in china and the cultural revolution in china she basically pioneered development economics as we know and visited the country six times in this period similarly wheelwright and mcfarlanes book is largely based on ontheground interviews and visits to china during the period
socialism,not_removed,well this is a great thread—totally unexpected op you may find this interview with a woman who grew up during the the gpcr useful a bit about her bai di grew up during the cultural revolution and is coeditor of some of us chinese women growing up during the mao era bai di talked about the lives of her grandmothers before the chinese revolution both had bound feet both had arranged marriages they each had children their lives were limited to giving birth they didnt even have their own names but had their husbands and fathers names with the word somebody added on at the end bai dis mother who came of age around the time of the revolution of was the first person in the family to go to college and her generation benefitted from the marriage law which abolished arranged marriage and the concubinage system bai di said that the cultural revolution furthered the liberation of women girls were equal to boys in every respect and this theme resounded in the theater and art of the period after maos revolution and especially during the cultural revolution women were encouraged to participate in all aspects of society women hold up half the sky was their slogan
socialism,not_removed,i dont know very much about it but ive read a short essay about the chinese famine written by utsa patnaik indian marxist economist suggests that there were errors made by the academics who published the data about the death tolls from her essay httpwwwideaswebsiteorgpdfsrepublichungerpdf two alternative routes have been used to estimate famine deaths both of very dubious validity in the first the missing millions totalling millions in the population pyramid during to have been identified with famine deaths the problem with this is that not only the people who were actually living and who died in excess of normal numbers are included in the missing millions but so are all those hypothetical persons included who were never born at all and who should have been born if the birth rate had not fallen this is not a commonsense definition nor is it a logical definition of famine deaths for to die in a famine a minimum necessary condition is to be born in the first place the chinese are a highly talented people but even they cannot achieve the feat of dying without being born if a person is told that million people died then quite correctly she would infer that those million were alive and then died the fact that million of them never existed because they were never born in the first place is not conveyed by the formulation hence there is disingenuousness involved in saying that million people died it is an untrue proposition the second route followed by the demographers coale and banister is perhaps even more dubious they take the population totals yielded by the official and censuses in china to be correct but dispute the official fertility rate even though it was based on a very large sample of million persons or of the then population especially canvassed along with the census as nai ruenn chen had informed us instead they use the much later census study to project back very high fertility rates to the past thus constructing an entirely hypothetical larger total of births between and if more people were born over the intercensal period to correspondingly these extra people must also have died over the same period for both authors despite rejecting every official vital rate display a touching faith in the absolute census population totals at these two dates hence the official increase in population is kept unchanged enabling them to assume exactly as many extra deaths as they assume extra births with this procedure the official figure of total deaths over the intercensal period was raised by a heroic percent both authors then arbitrarily allocated the assumed higher numbers of deaths over the individual intercensal years by assuming varying rates by which deaths were allegedly underreported during each of these years in short it was entirely up to the demographer how many extra deaths he or she assigned to the great leap years and the totally arbitrary nature of the procedure can be gauged by the fact that coale raised the death rate to nearly while banister raised it to compared to the official death rate of there is no reasonable basis for either figure it is a travesty of the norms of academic integrity that grossly exaggerated estimates of famine deaths derived in this arbitrary manner have been uncritically quoted and promoted and that they enjoy so much currency in my detailed critique patnaik i have also shown the inconsistency of the peak death rates constructed by coale and banister with the foodgrains output and availability figures in china my calculations also show that the lowest possible availability figures we can get for china after taking into account government procurement is still higher than in india and it is a puzzle why given a much more egalitarian distribution the death rate should have risen even to the officially declared level because the internal political developments in china after were in the direction of attacking maoist egalitarianism and the commune system no repudiation from chinese sources of the us estimates are to be seen like i said ive not looked into maoist china much more than this but i suggest that you read this essay and utsa patnaiks other work on the subject for a different opinion
socialism,not_removed,i think it was a step in the right direction so far as having the people themselves control the direction of society rather than the state
socialism,not_removed,there were errors and excesses but overwhelmingly more good than bad new things have hiccups to expect perfection is metaphysics
socialism,not_removed,im pretty pro cultural revolution both the chinese one but also the theory that a cultural revolution needs to take place in general i i think most people are pretty critical of the glf though with or without believing in the fairy tales told about it
socialism,not_removed,i recommend asking on ranarchism and rcommunism as well
socialism,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxcwafmgvls that show life during the gpcr
socialism,not_removed,im not fond of political purges
socialism,not_removed,another interesting book on the cr which is a bit more anacedotal although it does have some good information as well is httpmonthlyrevieworgproductunknownculturalrevolution published by the monthly review which was written by someone who grew up in a village during the cr
socialism,not_removed,didnt it destroy the economy and result in the killing of thousands
socialism,not_removed,a quick youtube search gave me plenty of videos of people who were witnesses and said it was horrible are these people manipulated or maybe faked in some way
socialism,not_removed,i will but im banned from r communism for being critical of the dprk
socialism,not_removed,do you know what this series is called or where i can find the entire thing online
socialism,not_removed,if that is all you think that the gpcr was then you have no idea what it was about
socialism,not_removed,probably more complicated than that
socialism,not_removed,if the people being purged are revisionists and corrupt bureaucrats why not fuck em
socialism,not_removed,me neither i think lots of innocent people got killed instead of actual revisionists
socialism,not_removed,i suggest you read httpmonthlyrevieworgcommentarydidmaoreallykillmillionsinthegreatleapforward commentary about this very subject
socialism,not_removed,didnt it destroy the economy no i will only be talking here about the great proletarian cultural revolution as including the great leap forward is a separate question that would take more time than i currently have to answer as a quick backdrop the glf was intended to avoid the mistakes of soviet industrialization ie overemphasizing heavy industry too much and neglecting agriculture the chinese having a much larger peasant population wanted to avoid this by taking a more balanced approach what they called walking on two legs now in recent scholarship on the period there have been strong arguments made that although we can and should view the great leap forward as a summary failure based on its own stated goals that what came out of it a minimum industrial base new technological innovations never before used in chinese agriculture and industry etc etc was positive however many have argued that the glf was many technological in scope and didnt really revolutionize rural relations this is the argument of dongping han who lived in china during the glf and gpcr before coming to the us to get his phd in hans book the unknown cultural revolution life and change in a chinese village he points out how the cultural revolution overcame a lot of the problems that the glf had and surpassed many of the unaccomplished goals of the glf for instance in the rural sphere educational opportunities were not really available to peasants even after the revolution in in in jimo county for example educational expenditure increased twofold from and the number of primary schools went from in to in and the rate of enrollment jumped to han unknown cultural revolution all that was cut back after the glf in which there was economic downsizing due to the campaign against the glf and its policies during the cultural revolution this changed and a massive campaign to extend schooling to the rural areas was undertaken as previously education was limited to urban residents due to lack of public services like transport in the rural areas and left over privilege from the preliberation period secondly even after the revolution the rural culture remained unchanged in china due to the prevalence of confucian teachings there was a notion of submission especially within the peasantry an old village saying of submission ensures a safe life courage leads to trouble perfectly encapsulates the prevailing idea in the rural areas consequently even after liberation and during the glf peasants mostly just submitted to orders from cadres who were mostly urban and there wasnt much input in decision making matters from the rural peoples they continued to submit the cultural revolution changed all of that with the campaign to criticize confucius the culture of submissiveness was challenged and swept away in most of the rural areas the formation of communes and revolutionary committees allowed for the rural as well as urban people to have direct input democratic control and empowerment in production and decision making also educational policies and public services returned and surpassed glf levels during the cultural revolution all of this was a part of the effort to bridge the gap between the countryside and the urban centers as far as economic performance lets look at agriculture first in a group of agronomists who were experts in crop development in asia travelled to china and described their experience in a new york times article on sept norman borlaug who was a nobel peace prize winner said you had to look hard to find a bad field everything was green and nice everywhere we travelled i felt the progress had been much more remarkable than what i expected sterling wortman head of the rocefeller foundation not exactly communist sympathizers said that the crop was really first rate there was just field after field that was as good as anything you can see she went on to say about the skill of the farmers and workers on the communes theyre all being brought up to the level of skills of the best people they all share the available inputs if you want to read the entire account of the agronomist study you can find it in the journal science from also worth noting is the increase in fertilizer use during the cultural revolution laid the foundations for later economic growth postmao in lee feigons mao a reinterpretation the author states between and industrial production in china grew annually at a rate of at least high by any standards and by many accounts it was substantially greater living standards and consumption remained depressed because this growth rate was financed by huge public investment but the rate of growth that mao achieved during what has been called the ten wasted years was high even in comparison with the postmao years and result in the killing of thousands yes people died some of it was unnecessary and honestly there were times when mao and others tried to intervene to stop some of the actions of red guards and others by the way there were also fake red guards that were set up that destroyed property and beat people etc so its hard sometimes to differentiate between red guards that were progpcr the ones everyone knows about and those who did it to cause trouble and commit violence secondly we should repudiate the western narrative that views the gpcr as some wierd stalinist power grab with mao as the puppet master because such a view doesnt fit with the events at all which thankfully even most anticommunist historians are abandoning this view the chinese thought of it as a revolution in the proper sense we should too consequently all the bad that comes with revolution is to be expected we shouldnt make excuses for it or unthinkingly apologize for it but we should seek to understand its causes and the only way to that understanding is to reject the puppet master power grab narrative book suggestions to learn more about the gpcr

socialism,not_removed,are they manipulated or faked maybe maybe not however this is my problem with many postmodern histories the overreliance on personal narrative to reconstruct a past event let me pose a question if i surveyed this sub right now for peoples personal experience in lets say the united states what do you think the response would be my guess is it would be overwhelmingly negative probably some embellishments too does that mean that we should discount them all no however we should keep a critical distance from overrelying on them when trying to write history personal accounts should inform and give contour if you will to the overall history of a given region event person etc etc they should not be the sole basis primarily because of embellishment bias misremembering places events people etc that is present in all personal narratives bottom line is everyone has an experience and a story to tell if we solely rely on personal narratives to learn about history and construct meaning then we are doomed to the most surface level understanding this is why your topshelf history books in places like barnes noble are utter fucking garbage what about the many personal experiences of those who look back on the cultural revolution with fondness the narratives coming out of china today are largely from the urban population which was the home of the people directly attacked by the gpcr while rural voices those who benefitted from the gpcr are largely ignored and pushed to the margins the chinese government even sponsored the creation of a new literary genre called scar literature that has the sole purpose of presenting the gpcr in a negative light with wild tales of sexual passions cannibalism fanaticism etc etc this is in line with the chinese governments policy of condemning the gpcr since deng secondly as an example when jung chang was promoting the book mao the unknown story in south korea she was talking to an audience about how the gpcr was the worst event in human history then a young chinese man stood up and asked her what her background was to which she replied that her family was well to do and that they were intellectuals which in china meant that you had institutional privileges like educational access city living and not having to do manual labor the chinese man wasnt surprised and said that he came from a peasant family and that the gpcr was when his father learned how to read when they were able to travel to the city for the first time the first time that they had enough food to eat the first opening of educational opportunities for adults and children and when his father actually had a say in what went on in his local village through the commune this is recounted in the unknown cultural revolution all of this enabled the son to later get a job in a factory in the city and attend university is his narrative worthless
socialism,not_removed,could you find just as many people who were witnesses and said it was good mediocre how about historians can you speak mandarin
socialism,not_removed,chinese people worship mao zedong eh thats some orientalist bullshit
socialism,not_removed,i hope you dont just get swarmed with leftcoms here then
socialism,not_removed,you can probably appeal your ban
socialism,not_removed,i dont know the proper name but theyre all on youtube to my knowledge
socialism,not_removed,i know it was a part of it
socialism,not_removed,because they werent the only ones
socialism,not_removed,are you a historian by any chance your comments are by far the most informative in the subreddit
socialism,not_removed,thank you for your informative post but this the cultural revolution changed all of that with the campaign to criticize confucius the culture of submissiveness was challenged and swept away in most of the rural areas the formation of communes and revolutionary committees allowed for the rural as well as urban people to have direct input democratic control and empowerment in production and decision making is debatable at the very least anita chans chen village from revolution to globalization paints a very different portrait of the campaign to criticize lin biao and confucius in the accounts she gathers from the titular guangdong village the campaign is described as having been primarily with confusion and incomprehension by peasants who saw little connection between criticism of confucius and their daily lives or with lin biao whose condemnation by the party also is described as having hurt its image among peasants previous unpopular policies associated with the party were attributed to biao as a simple method of relegating them to the dustbin often with tongue planted firmly in cheek the campaign is remembered as having primarily benefited the oldest members of the village who finally had more expertise on the subject at hand than even the sentdown cadres as a result of their education other villagers with less knowledge of confucianism copied their example in the regular sessions i dont have my copy with me and so cannot elaborate extensively but it also describes the on the ground experience of villagers in the context of party agricultural policy
socialism,not_removed,uthemcattacker any comments on this post
socialism,not_removed,what is your opinion of red scarf girl
socialism,not_removed,yooooo thank you for these book suggestions
socialism,not_removed,the formation of communes and revolutionary committees allowed for the rural as well as urban people to have direct input democratic control and empowerment in production and decision making could you provide a book recommendation which covers this topic in any detail
socialism,not_removed,this is really great i will be saving this comment so many sources too thanks for the contributions to this community
socialism,not_removed,source i ask because contemporary scholars on the mao period in china put the total deaths during the cultural revolution at around with most of those occurring during the three year period of
socialism,not_removed,because mao is solely to blame for a comparatively moderate famine in a region that suffered regular famines for centuries dontcha know
socialism,not_removed,wow thats indeed a whole new way of looking at something like the cultural revolutionglf thanks for your insight
socialism,not_removed,no dont know what you mean with mediocre there are probably some who supported itsaid it wasnt that bad no i do not speak mandarin
socialism,not_removed,could you maybe ask it on r communism would still like to see what they think about it
socialism,not_removed,memes
socialism,not_removed,they dont reply
socialism,not_removed,i have no idea what it was about ftfy
socialism,not_removed,til kicking capitalists out of a proletarian state is a bad thing
socialism,not_removed,in every revolution literally every single one innocent people have been persecuted should we criticize it and figure out where we went wrong to improve ourselves absolutely but to single out the gpcr for this is lunacy
socialism,not_removed,yes actually i dont study china though i study the century radical labor movement in the us workingclass culture and the development of the communist socialist and anarchist movements and ideology primarily in the west
socialism,not_removed,ill defenitely be reading through some of those
socialism,not_removed,been meaning to read that one for a bit as it is one of the more famous scar literature books i just dont really read fiction or memoirs so i just havent gotten to it yet
socialism,not_removed,mainly about capitalist restoration in china but it describes how the above things were transformed into their opposite or ended the unknown cultural revolution which focuses on rural mass democracy and the communes short piece from the china policy study group also check httpwwwbannedthoughtnetchinamaoeracontemporarycommentarycpsgindexhtm for an archive of all their studies
socialism,not_removed,amazing response as usual kc can i get the source of that number please thank you
socialism,not_removed,im being a bit of a jerk but what i mean is that if searching youtube for english language anecdotes is your methodology youre going to also be immediately convinced that was an inside job and that aliens built the egyptian pyramids thats not scientific
socialism,not_removed,a mural of george washington depicted as a godking is painted on the capitol buildings roof does that mean americans worship him
socialism,not_removed,does the ban extend to as well anyway there are numerous indepth posts on the topic in that sub you can find if you search the terms gpcr and cultural revolution
socialism,not_removed,it was a large part of it
socialism,not_removed,but to single out the gpcr for this is lunacy where did they single out gpcr
socialism,not_removed,have you read yang jishengs tombstone any thoughts or counterarguments on it
socialism,not_removed,maos china and after a history of the peoples republic cites this number as was originally reported by agence france presse many other contemporary scholarship corroborates the number although their window of time in which those occurred varies also worth noting is that when the gang of four were tried the official ruling was that people died james p sterba new york times january which was the official number in the early deng years since the campaign to separate themselves from the gpcr the chinese governments new official number is now in the millions however even from anticommunists that number is suspicious because the chinese government wont reveal how the data was collected to arrive at such numbers hence why you have many scholars today gravitating towards as the currently most accurate but then you have others who accept the chinese governments number or posit million or million or etc etc point being there is far from a consensus and no number should be taken as irrefutably accurate because there is such a discrepancy in the reported numbers and the methodology used to reach said numbers
socialism,not_removed,i understand you completely but its just that most stuff that ive read about it seems to be negative
socialism,not_removed,i was banned from there as well for saying that there are other books to read than stalin mao and lenin
socialism,not_removed,this individual was critiquing the gpcr because of political purges they found them unjust i retorted by saying that in every revolution there have always be excesses and injustice in varying degrees the gpcr is not the only revolution guilty of this all of them are
socialism,not_removed,well since this thread is specifically about the gpcr
socialism,not_removed,i have not ill add it to my list of books to read thanks
socialism,not_removed,permanently or just temporarily
socialism,not_removed,which means theyre not singling it out because it would be random to discuss all the other ones
socialism,not_removed,i think it was a perm ban but ill check later
socialism,not_removed,automation under communism aka technocommunism is awesome but automation under capitalism or technofeudalism sounds like a cyberpunk dystopia
socialism,not_removed,addidas plans to re open their shoe factories in germany using robots because they are cheaper than world labor driverless cars will replace bustrain drivers taxi drivers uber drivers as uber plans to buy driverless cars from tesla mcdonalds have been opening automated restaurants a law company just bought its first law robot china is opening up fully automated factories and its been bringing in record profits automation is going to take over the world and its the best thing that could ever happen to the socialist cause what are reactionaries going to do when they cant sell their bodies for wage pay not because an illegal has stollen it but because there are simply no jobs for them to be had theyre going to starve to death i dont think so
socialism,not_removed,i recall listening to a talk where the speaker i dont remember who it was explained that capitalism will approach full automation asymptotically meaning that it will slow down its progress towards full automation the closer it gets there and never quite make it throwing huge sections of the workforce out of work would make labor cheaper thus decreasing the incentive to invest in automation one possible dystopian future is as capitalist production becomes more automated paid labor slowly gets replaced by paid shilling this world would be full of people who dont produce anything but are paid to constantly talk about how great their vacuum cleaner is in order to put food on the table honest communication would be drowned out in censorious noise
socialism,not_removed,so automation is a tool i can make shirts per day but when i built a robot i can make per day because i dont have to literally do the sewing it magnifies human labour you can then automate sure my new automatic robot fleet can make because i dont have to even operate the robots i still have to fix andor set up robots or develop better ones so yeah when the bourgeoisie get fantastic new tools its a pretty nasty thing but to talk about full automation is basically talking about the labour version of the perpetual motion machine
socialism,not_removed,rtechnocommunism
socialism,not_removed,lots of unsubstantiated claims there is there any piece of technology that has ever really lived up to the hype every tech just comes with new problems that requires more new tech to fix its neverending having worked in factories all of that automated shit breaks down constantly like every single day with state of the art equipment it would require work to fix it and theres also the potential for catastrophes when it breaks down how exactly would environmental problems be fixed where are you getting all the nonrenewable materials needed for this dont bother replying if your answer is space then theres the question of would you even really want it im not sure id want a world completely run by machines automation generally just leads to mass produced mediocrity and less individual decision making dont people like doing and creating for themselves shaping their environment where does this mentality stop should we just automate music and books too it might make sense for the stuff that absolutely noone likes to do but otherwise i dont see the attraction
socialism,not_removed,rtechnocommunism
socialism,not_removed,asymptotically meaning that it will slow down its progress towards full automation the closer it gets there that is the exact opposite of asymptotically
socialism,not_removed,but to talk about full automation is basically talking about the labour version of the perpetual motion machine thats a fantastic metaphor comrade
socialism,not_removed,or its a horizontal asymptote
socialism,not_removed,do you really think that is the way that automation is developing though
socialism,not_removed,i am honestly very skeptical of the idea that we will ever get fully automated technocommunism if nothing else by the time ai is developed sufficiently to automate many of the daily tasks we do wed have to start worrying about ai rights
socialism,not_removed,i dont know i rather believe that ai will be pressed into service by the ruling class much as every other advancement in technology
socialism,not_removed,oh sure thats the most likely scenario but even if theres a communist revolution i just dont see full automation as being an achievable goal or a particularly desirable one
socialism,not_removed,i think it will be a lot like the intrusion of realtime connectivity and exposure to the spectacle you may choose not to have that intrusion here and there but that does little to stem the tide
socialism,not_removed,for anyone that hasnt been acquainted with the distilled and concentrated badassery of paul robeson
socialism,not_removed,is a lot if you consider that the whole pseudocolony has only about inhabitants i hope they start to smash up the bourgeois state there something fierce to get their demands
socialism,not_removed,its not a pseudocolony its a colony masqueraded as a pseudoregion
socialism,not_removed,well maybe but a colony has not even a masquerade of local bourgeois democracy or the pretence that the people there are something else but cattle thats why i wrote pseudocolony but the term pseudodepartement might also be fitting
socialism,not_removed,i got it until it got to the green toy edit why is this in socialism
socialism,not_removed,socialism is concerned with all plights against oppression for example the oppression against nonbinary individuals
socialism,not_removed,what would benefit anticapitalist ideologies more integration a lot more what will happen not much probably
socialism,not_removed,probably more exiting
socialism,not_removed,abolition
socialism,not_removed,its abolition
socialism,not_removed,more integration means easier coordinated dissent
socialism,not_removed,who do you think will follow britains footsteps
socialism,not_removed,do you mean to say the eu will push a selfdestruct button through policy proposals will the people abolish it through popular dissent will states exit until a gradual abolition takes places im interested care to elaborate
socialism,not_removed,that seems to be the general consensus in this sub
socialism,not_removed,no not really easier coordination can be achieved right now however it might increase class solidarity beyond national borders and with that weaken the extreme right
socialism,not_removed,no idea tbh im not located in an eu country
socialism,not_removed,thats kind of what i meant
socialism,not_removed,thats cool the system does need to be abolished if not at least replaced
socialism,not_removed,the over a decade fictional accusations of venezuela being a dictatorship make me question just how many other past countries really have been dictatorships
socialism,not_removed,i hope cuba iran and venezuela get their nukes too we need some more dictatorships being able to stare down the country that isnt a dictatorship but still somehow tells everyone everywhere what to do
socialism,not_removed,most media companies dont do basic research anymore if they took the time to do the research we would be hearing a more accurate story about the constitutional crisis for example the venezuelan national assembly has been in contempt of court since they reseated three opposition legislators and all actions they have taken are automatically null and void they could have found a way to fix the economy but no they just want maduro out and to restore the republic
socialism,not_removed,except for the fact that maduro is essentially a lame duck because the opposition holds their parliament
socialism,not_removed,mandela was considered a terrorist by the usa
socialism,not_removed,the middle east needs iran with nukes very badly as a stabilizing agent in the region iran would be able to fight saudi arabia through proxy wars without worrying about becoming a crater
socialism,not_removed,my thinking exactly im not a khomeinist but i can totally see how that inspired them to fight against colonialism considering how democratic socialism was crushed by the capitalist lapdogs
socialism,not_removed,in what way does a saudi arabiairan war help the middle class in either country literally at all sure its not imperialism but its still two islamic capitalist nations fighting for basically religious reasons i support irana defense against imperialism but the islamist regime is still reactionary as fuck
socialism,not_removed,its a matter of maintaining sovereignty against the us and its henchmen thats the first step before the working classes can mobilise and make radical changes
socialism,not_removed,how does it benefit the proletariat in sa why wouldnt a religious war simply strengthen the islamists in iran
socialism,not_removed,khomeinists are anticolonial islamist republicans thats very progressive compared both to the us and saudi arabia you cant expect people to instantly have your views its a gradual development the left wing may have been born during the french revolution but its predicated on the protestant reformation for instance an event triggered by martin luther one of the most vicious antisemites in europe this is how it works people need not just the revolutionary ideas but also the premise that synthesises them
socialism,not_removed,the illusion that individuals are able to accrue wealth by a fair means is one entirely created by capitalism even under feudalism and slave societies it was perfectly clear that the wealth held by individuals was created by their slaves or serfs because production despite being controlled by the ruling classes was geared towards the satisfaction of human need now under capitalism production is geared towards the market and human need comes secondarily this along with the nature of wage labour allows capitalist ideology to separate the relations of production from political society and therefore have people believe that capitalist production is simply a fair natural and free transaction between worker and owner but really there is nothing inherently natural about it and the state of affairs as it is is imposed by a mixture of state control via the police economic restrictions on workers like welfare etc and propaganda in short nobody accrues wealth as an individual or private group or more generally capitalist class without a combination of violence and ideology imposed upon workers socialism would have production be democratic truly so there would be no means to become rich in the capitalist sense
socialism,not_removed,if i am making the most wealth in my group or countryand doing all by a fair means wealth is never accumulated singularly to get that wealth there is a lot of luck and a lot of work that other people put into it you used technology that is the result of hundreds of years of government investment in r d and education you probably went to school at a public university and if you didnt it is run by or has professors trained at a public university you use the infrastructure paid for by taxes this is all not to mention the labor process itself steve jobs was certainly intelligent and worked hard but did he mine the coltan to put in his phones did he create or assemble the microchips did he build the satellites and put them in space did he assemble the phones if your response is well he compensated those people then you should look up the labor theory of value and marxs theory of exploitation watch and it will explain a lot
socialism,not_removed,for future reference this isnt exactly an educational sub and is more suited to questions like yours but i can still answer this so i might as well the system you describe as socialism is called social democracy social democracy is a form of capitalism capitalism is an economic system with private ownership of the means of production anything used to make products or perform services and markets social democracy is capitalism but the state redistributes more wealth to people with less and funds some social programs eg singlepayer healthcare for example bernie sanders is a social democratic politician and sweden is a social democratic country socialism as it is understood on this sub is a system that ends private property and empowers the working class before i explain further it is important to point out that socialists draw a firm line in between private property and personal property your personal property is simply all the things you personally use your place of residence your toothbrush and your car are all your personal property socialists are perfectly content to let you do whatever you want with these things we have no interest in collectivizing them or anything like that private property is different private property is property that you dont use a factory or any other means of production is private property a condo that you dont live in but rent for a profit would also be considered private property socialists dislike private property and the way it is enforced by the state socialists want to end private property because we assert that it allows the propertied class to exploit the working class and get rich without doing anything of value socialists hold that the only thing that holds inherent value is labor so when the boss or the landlord or other propertied individual makes a profit without contributing labor they are stealing that profit from the worker in response to this problem socialists propose the economy should be managed democratically and workers should own the means of production directly so in that sense socialism is much less about taking money from those who contribute and giving it to those who dont and much more about taking property from those who dont contribute and expropriating it among those who do
socialism,not_removed,seems like your class consciousness is lacking check out this and this and then ask your question again
socialism,not_removed,please direct beginner questions to
socialism,not_removed,your comment is fantastic but id like to add to it a bit for the sake of ubengumness have people believe that capitalist production is simply a fair natural and free transaction between worker and owner op one of the greatest fallacies that capitalism relies on is the idea that participation in the system is voluntary there is simply no alternative form of economy in the world today and there is no way to provide the basic needs of life that does not ultimately revolve around the global free market so for example if you want to become a subsistence farmer to escape capitalism you have to buy seeds farming equipment and a plot of farmland including a means of shelter the world is interconnected enough these days that you simply cannot pull a thoreau and live life completely outside the system so what choice do people have they participate in the labor market because without wages they will not survive but because ownership of the workplace is not democratic they have no power to decide what their work is worth in terms of recompensation for their labor and the owner of the workplace has a motive to profit because the capitalist world is ruthlessly competitive and he himself needs to maximise profits to please investors and to maximise profit he pays his employees as little as he can get away with any profit is ultimately siphoning from the value that the workers produced goods are sold for theres a lot to critique about capitalism too much for one post the market relies on artificial scarcity to drive up demand and sales so that essential things like shelter and medication are rendered unaffordable the global supply chain necessitates the existence of people in thirdworld countries working in slavelabor conditions uncountable amounts of effort are wasted in marketing and advertising when in reality no sector of the economy needs or benefits from the competitiveness that capitalism requires from everything theres more and more topics that could be delved into but for now ill just leave it at addressing the idea of labor being a nonexploitative exchange and you can ask me about other things if youre curious
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,so what choice do people have they participate in the labor market because without wages they will not survive gee you mean the classic nobodys forcing you to take a job go get a better job if you think you deserve one somehow doesnt hold water
socialism,not_removed,yeah you right
socialism,not_removed,ive had this experience before i interned at a large dc lobbying firm that was advocating for the defense industry not knowing much about your situation such as having kids or others who financially depend on you i would say your options are to become more comfortable compartmentalizing what you have to do to survive with your values which we all do to one degree or another however if it is causing such significant internal distress you might be a happier person in a role that allows you to live your values
socialism,not_removed,i work in marketing and becoming woke and a socialist in the past year or so has pretty much destroyed my previous dream of becoming a vp or cmo in a large tech company after some self reflection im making the transition into healthcare nursing which is more interesting to me anyway its never too late to make a change in your career if you feel in your heart youre not meant for your line of work edit i do also agree with what uthehagueface says and that no matter what youre going to have compartmentalize in almost every career i too will have to deal working in for profit hospitals with for profit admins who rather cut staff in order to maximize profits
socialism,not_removed,the true socialist way and splitting into as many meme subreddits as possible
socialism,not_removed,dont ultras think that subreddits are petite bourgeois forms of organization and totalitarian
socialism,not_removed,i thought this would be a good daycare for my child turns out its just a place where leftcoms shitpost i dont need my snuckums speaking with such vulgar language and no child of mine will be exposed to the dangerous ideology that is communism highly recommend against going there report to the authorities
socialism,not_removed,subscribed
socialism,not_removed,best sub on this planet
socialism,not_removed,what
socialism,not_removed,good point
socialism,not_removed,the joke is that ultras are commonly depicted as being opposed to any kind of organization
socialism,not_removed,dont ultras think that subreddits are petite bourgeois forms of organization and totalitarian
socialism,not_removed,we are all leftcoms on this blessed day
socialism,not_removed,youre looking for postleftist anarchists
socialism,not_removed,oh haha i took it too literally
socialism,not_removed,ultras are commonly depicted as being opposed to any kind of organization tfw when theres three left communist parties
socialism,not_removed,for real though those guys are the worst
socialism,not_removed,tfw someone expects some shitty meme to accurately reflect real politics
socialism,not_removed,so many
socialism,not_removed,cultural postmarxism hoxhaismeurocommunism
socialism,not_removed,still better than five thousand splinter parties with ridiculous ideologies also theyre international you know internationalism parties dont need one for each country
socialism,not_removed,anarchist
socialism,not_removed,its the only true socialist tendency really
socialism,not_removed,having nearly all of your members atomized and scattered throughout europe who never organize on a significant scale offline and who write about how free palestine is a proimperialist movement because it ignores class struggle isnt really that internationalist but thats none of my business
socialism,not_removed,maoist
socialism,not_removed,raf huehuehue
socialism,not_removed,who never organize on a significant scale offline what exactly are maoists doing tbh
socialism,not_removed,subreddit how can you call yourself a socialist when you hypocritically use reddit a capitalist website
socialism,not_removed,again anarchist
socialism,not_removed,maoists are at the head of if not the sole tendency and take active roles in revolutionary and protorevolutonary movements in india nepal the philippines turkey although you could argue the hoxhaist mlkp is more prominent there afghanistan and historically peru there is also significant maoist presence and influence in the ypgrojava and within the zapatistas maoism was also a heavy influence on the bpp in the us and maoist organizations in the us like rga and rgla are forming the base for a new revolutionary formation in america are these movements without faults no despite their shortcomings and errors these groups still have been the most successful socialist movements in recent times even if you dont think this is enough and come up with a hundred reasons for each movement why its antimarxist or not really socialist or whatever you look at all the real socialist movements according to leftcoms and most have never come as close to toppling capitalism or the bourgeois state as maoists have
socialism,not_removed,reddit is my property ive just yet to attain power over it
socialism,not_removed,believing people will ever voluntarily relinquish power huehuehuehue
socialism,not_removed,calm down stirner
socialism,not_removed,solid have you even read marx you revisionist dont you know that all that is solid melts into air
socialism,not_removed,everything is broadly under the ideology of liberalism but it does portray every now and again struggles the ussr supported that nowadays are acceptable tm to support apartheid in s africa for example its enjoyable
socialism,not_removed,i watched the first two seasons its pretty slow its interesting though my memory is a bit foggy but personally i would say it is not all that prowestern or pro capitalist although it is to an extent
socialism,not_removed,one of my favourite shows
socialism,not_removed,ive only watched the first or so episodes of season it seems to be more of a story about a marriage using the kgb spycold war elements as background decoration maybe this changes as the show progresses i never really bought that the main characters ever believed in any type of communism or socialism they always refer to doing things for my country which turns it into some type of generic spy thing i find stories with soviet spies more interesting when they actually believe they are furthering the world revolution whether or not thats true a much better cold war spy drama with communist spies as the main characters is deutschland its a german language show about an east german spy going undercover in west germany
socialism,not_removed,it has some really compelling characters and storylines
socialism,not_removed,i enjoy the show for what it is a interesting espionage drama it does portray both sides in fairly neutral lights the fbi even shoot people in the back of the head really enjoyable show with villains on both sides deutschland is also good though i am only half way through that
socialism,not_removed,theres absolutely a prous slant it was written by a former cia agent after all but less demonization of marxist rhetoric than you might expect in season when a character becomes religious the primary couples reaction is a clear satirize of western hysteria toward communist indoctrination i think the americans is certainly betterthanaverage cold war fiction in terms of truthfulness elizabeth and philip are communists and while their ideology only rarely comes up in the show theyre never villainized for this
socialism,not_removed,it seems neutral and politics isnt the focus of the show really great drama
socialism,not_removed,the politics really take a backseat
socialism,not_removed,i finished the first season recently in my estimation elizabeth seems to be an earnest communist phillip is maybe more pragmatic but a story about a marriage using the kgb spycold war elements as background decoration isnt a terrible description although its a marriage thats basically defined by its status as a front for kgb operatives
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,a great read to give to brocialists when they say that class should always come before gender or socialism would solve sexism so we should only focus on seizing the means of production
socialism,not_removed,goddamn those user comments on that video
socialism,not_removed,great news if we dont stand up to these wannabe nazi punks then we dont have any hope of crushing their power
socialism,not_removed,context
socialism,not_removed,if you use violence against nazis that makes u just as bad as them which is why we should use violence against you but not nazis
socialism,not_removed,they do have worrying ties to islamist groups and are known for staging events but as a whole i think they do good work
socialism,not_removed,western corporate stooges as far as i can tell
socialism,not_removed,any sources
socialism,not_removed,it is clear to me that the white helmets are not all that they seem and are not above paying people or staging pr stunts while none of that is particularly surprising i wish there were more information available while i dont have much confidence in any of your sources i dont speak arabic and so dont understand the context of the videos while the others look back to the same web of conspiracy evidently identifying george soros as the main backer of regime change along with the wicked msm as written by beeley maybe theyre not actually literally blackwater i cant wholeheartedly criticize your use of them because i recognize there is precious little accurate information to be had about the situation and about the white helmets while i think taking part in the execution where they remove a body is an exaggeration despite not sharing your opinion i definitely feel i am better informed than i was a half hour ago so thank you for that
socialism,not_removed,oh shit i forgot to mention two things in the description it was a bit rushed since we got postponed with the editing of our new sponsor segments trigger warning everyone we make fun of rush limbaughs statements on rape we make fun of him not rape itself wed never do that because that would be fucked up but yeah we do mention the misdeed so keep that in mind also forgot to add my article httplibcomorglibrarylumpenbourgeoisiestuartjan
socialism,not_removed,so fucking good to see another one of these right now good on yall 👍
socialism,not_removed,how have i not heard of this before
socialism,not_removed,there are some points i could clarify but that shout out was hilarious so ill let it all be keep on keeping on 👌 ps ⃣⃣⃣⃣ 👮💩
socialism,not_removed,you can have a comma before and its called the oxford comma literally unplayable unlistenable
socialism,not_removed,thank you all for your lovely feedback
socialism,not_removed,thanks we also listened to you all and your feedback so now we have more intros between segments hopefully itll add some entertainment value and be sure to check out that bonus content when youre done listening
socialism,not_removed,i for one blame the cia
socialism,not_removed,also id hope the blast would occur while i was taking a duece
socialism,not_removed,yeah me and josh you shouldnt clarify things to us you have more constructive things to do than to waste logic on us were in flat earth society and read the guardian unironically glad to hear you like the shoutout though good to have you with us on this journeyful confluence of podding and casts
socialism,not_removed,i dont use the oxford comma i use the comma comma comma comma comma chameleon its a technique of punctuation developed in cambridge actually it combines clarity and aesthetic
socialism,not_removed,right quick warning everyone here is a fake account josh goes by not sure what this is all about
socialism,not_removed,thats untrue
socialism,not_removed,its a matter of public record you imperialist spy
socialism,not_removed,dont black people share these vids as well i mean is there anything suggesting white people are especially prone to sharing them seems odd like i can sort of see their point at the same time though it feels like the most minor possible problem you know in comparison to the real world actions and its like why criticize people who are intending to be on your side idk it just seems a bit nitpicky to me im sure others will disagree with me on this
socialism,not_removed,what do comrades of color think about this
socialism,not_removed,i meant to say in the title that i dont agree with this
socialism,not_removed,where can i read about the strasserites and their economic beliefs their wikipedia article is small
socialism,not_removed,what significant difference was there then between strasserites and more mainstream wings of the nsdap
socialism,not_removed,theres a stressarist ama on rdebatefascism if you search by top of all time to save you some time though its full of contradictions and racism really the only thing it has in common with socialism is the elimination of capital from the current bourgeoisie stressarist just want to then place it in the hands of white blond tall and blue eyed bourgeoisie
socialism,not_removed,some strasserites i talked to believe that hitler betrayed the german workers by siding with the capitalists and it seems like some of them are literal national socialists typical nationalism worker selfmanagement
socialism,not_removed,has this happened
socialism,not_removed,it is always great to see the fire of revolution still burning bright across the globe
socialism,not_removed,great insight from mr leftcom himself on why ultimately a seizure of power is needed for the workers to be truly liberated
socialism,not_removed,its the american way
socialism,not_removed,a peaceful transition of terror
socialism,not_removed,as the late young yemeni writer ibrahim mothana told congress in drone strikes are causing more and more yemenis to hate america and join radical militants unfortunately liberal voices in the united states are largely ignoring if not condoning civilian deaths and extrajudicial killings in yemen during george w bushs presidency the rage would have been tremendous but today there is little outcry even though what is happening is in many ways an escalation of mr bushs policies defenders of human rights must speak out americas counterterrorism policy here is not only making yemen less safe by strengthening support for aqap but it could also ultimately endanger the united states and the entire world
socialism,not_removed,is this part of the inauguration process or something
socialism,not_removed,but i was told he was non interventionist but really i have the sneaking feeling we are about the learn that the only thing worse than a well executed campaign of targeted killing is a poorly executed one its kind of striking that the dronehappy obama administration had been mulling this operation over for months and trump just up and approved it right away
socialism,not_removed,america why do terrorists hate us
socialism,not_removed,i am sure anyone related to these people wont take up arms against us and become terrorists
socialism,not_removed,this title confused the fuck out of me for a second
socialism,not_removed,i think that americas image is tarnished beyond repair its not the beacon of democracy its not the home of the middle class its not the horn of freedom its a superpower with all the warts america is nothing special its dirt there are literally countries who do democracy better
socialism,not_removed,and before we successfully killed their fatheramerican citizen anwar alawlaki for giving sermons we considered to be material aidwe killed civilians by drone attack on a wedding in yemen anwar turned out to not be attending before that attack alqaeda had little foothold in yemen hearts and minds
socialism,not_removed,meet the new boss more or less same as the old boss
socialism,not_removed,theres your choice of parties folks genocide with healthcare or genocide with border walls
socialism,not_removed,if you talk to any infantry whove been in combat or people from these regions whove been invaded by the us you know that child killings arent rare theyre the norm the scary thing about trump isnt that hes taking the us in some new hideous direction its that he embodies all of the ghastly qualities of the us that liberals prefer to ignore
socialism,not_removed,at this point anyone who continues to defend the obama administration or the democrats is literal garbage
socialism,not_removed,thank you for sharing i read it all its very sad the comments are a bit weird
socialism,not_removed,welp he did say you have to take out their families how refreshing to have a president that sticks to his campaign promises im just gonna go outside and throw up about something else
socialism,not_removed,unless theyre goosestepping down pennsylvania ave it isnt fascism apparently
socialism,not_removed,when i first read this headline i interpreted as trump killed trumps eight year old sister it still took me several seconds to realize the error
socialism,not_removed,thank you for sharing this
socialism,not_removed,the ugly misshapen fruits of imperialismwhich remains a universal constant no matter which of the two corporate parties presides over it
socialism,not_removed,cant say trump isnt keeping up with his campaign promises i seem to remember a little something about going after the families of terrorists i expect to see more of these collateral damage type events in the future and maybe this is one of those things the whole muslim ban ordeal is meant to distract from i hope trumps keeping barron close cause its just a matter of time before they start going tit for tat
socialism,not_removed,see guys theyre not so different
socialism,not_removed,christ were they targaryens
socialism,not_removed,two wrongs dont make a right
socialism,not_removed,im not surprised trump did say hed go after the families of terrorists
socialism,not_removed,til obama had a sister
socialism,not_removed,socialism isnt the answer
socialism,not_removed,nailed it period
socialism,not_removed,the pictures of the girl and boy did it for me theyre just kids man
socialism,not_removed,how do you fight the current terrorism style of hide within a peaceful population
socialism,not_removed,i think a large part of the problem was that we as americans lost track of who our government was bombing which resulted in a sort of information overload
socialism,not_removed,was his cause of death ever released
socialism,not_removed,source of this
socialism,not_removed,that reminds me of a song i pushed the button and elected him to office and a he pushed the button and he dropped the bomb you pushed the button and could watch it on the television those motherfuckers didnt last too long nine inch nails capital g
socialism,not_removed,the idea that trump was some sort of dove compared to hillary was absurdity of the presidential campaign
socialism,not_removed,personally i think a well executed campaign of massive indiscriminate killings is much worse than either a well or poorly executed campaign of targeted killings but im being intentionally pedantic nothing to see here
socialism,not_removed,sounds like a good trade but well run out of presidents too quickly at the rate theyre killing civilians
socialism,not_removed,i understand the sentiment but this is how you get the secret service on your ass my dude be careful
socialism,not_removed,totally agree with you by creating the conditions for neverending war they also create the conditions for war profiteers foster this sort of thing without any regard for the future generations who will suffer the consequences of the hostile actions taken today amd when the reprisals come most will not understand the connection between the two events
socialism,not_removed,trump just killed his sister why is this not in the news
socialism,not_removed,why were they killed
socialism,not_removed,tbh i agree
socialism,not_removed,ive got bad news for you its not just americas image trump is a new ugly face on an existing ugly reality
socialism,not_removed,what are the countries
socialism,not_removed,he was also an american citizen and because he never picked up a weapon on a battlefield he was technically entitled to due process which the us justice system denied him
socialism,not_removed,in this regard vastly different on many other things
socialism,not_removed,what if the genocide involves workers having healthcare and owners against the wall
socialism,not_removed,or just misinformed aka brainwashed
socialism,not_removed,you read that one democrat killed a person and one republican killed a person and came to the conclusion democrats are garbage lol
socialism,not_removed,it goes both ways
socialism,not_removed,of course hes keeping his campaign promises but if you recall taking his promises seriously was supposedly just alarmist hysteria during the campaign hes just putting on a show for the crowd hed never get away with it and so on funny how quickly that changed to why are you surprised
socialism,not_removed,seal raid this morning killed everyone on sight including women and children
socialism,not_removed,youre right full communism is the answer
socialism,not_removed,luxury gay space communism is the answer
socialism,not_removed,i have severe doubts you even know what it is its rather unfortunate youll likely be banned for this comment before you can ask any questions to learn
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,dont bomb civilians like a terrorist would probs a good start
socialism,not_removed,there is also a ton of misinformation and lack of coverage how many people hear about these bombings if they just watch nightly news then they probably dont hear much even if they do is it spun to be about protecting us people want to believe we only do good and its easy to just accept we are making the world safer than the truth a lot of other countries get news thats more accurate about what we did than our own people
socialism,not_removed,theres also a new type psychological distance drone strikes dont sound human it doesnt sound like war americans can feel less accountable when a drone does it
socialism,not_removed,i tell my liberal friends that obama was doing this and all they can say is well no presidents perfect its not a big ask stop bombing innocent people
socialism,not_removed,i think a large part of the problem was that we as americans lost track of who our government was bombing which resulted in a sort of information overload the silence is intentional and it lies across party lines just look at the dramatic change in tone and reporting coverage now that the executive branch belongs to the gop
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,huh huh
socialism,not_removed,donald kill them all and their families bomb the hell out of them torture them whether it works or not for intel waterboarding is too tame trumpers guys he wants to put america first tm that means no more war he even said he doesnt believe in nation building so thats gotta mean peace right
socialism,not_removed,i dont think anyone sane ever considered the man a dove pointing out the hillary is a warhawk isnt calling trump a dove could mean hes a peregrine falcon
socialism,not_removed,the idea that trump was some sort of dove compared to hillary was absurdity not entirely definitely more of a dove towards russia
socialism,not_removed,thats the plan
socialism,not_removed,fuck trump and fuck every american coward too scared to stop a fascist
socialism,not_removed,i was more like year old sister my ass the man is years old
socialism,not_removed,not too farfetched but trump did have sex with his kid when she was a minor
socialism,not_removed,interestingly there are countries which receive a perfect in this analysis httpsenwikipediaorgwikipolitydataseries the fact that the us gets a seems like bullshit to me given fptp two party dominance executive branch power influence of money in politics and the fact that its proven that policy absolutely does not correspond with popular opinion that is a joke
socialism,not_removed,pick any western european country canada japan australia nz to start
socialism,not_removed,well trumps most visible acts so far have been the ban on people from certain muslim countries entering the us something obama already did though less intensely and to much less condemnation appointing business cronies in his administration something obama also did bombing muslim countries and murdering children in the name of the war on terror something obama did a lot of extrajudicial assassinations of american citizens something obama established and did and a rather toothless order to build the wall on the mexican border something obama didnt specifically do but the democrats and establishment republicans supported previously the one major difference ive noticed so far is him stopping the tpp so yeah hes pretty similar so far to obama im sure hell set himself apart in other ways as time goes on i mean for chrissake hes only been in office for a bit over a week but from my perspective the major difference has been how people are responding to his acts not the specific acts hes doing edit to be complete his rhetoric is different obviously but talk is talk im just going on actual actions undertaken while president which is really the only thing you judge a president by given politicians tendency for misdirection deflection and straight up lying
socialism,not_removed,if you say so
socialism,not_removed,im sorry with the abundance of information out there any misinformation at this point is selfimposed and deliberate people arent misinformed they just refuse to question a political order that benefits them im a cis man the prevailing political order benefits me but i go out of my way to educate myself because its not right that i enjoy so much privilege while others suffer anyone who is unwilling because it honestly does come down to a matter of will to do the same is a weak coward and should be cast aside
socialism,not_removed,well to be specific he said that people who defend the democrats are garbage but the point is that theres in inherit hypocrisy in supporting one and condemning the other obamas presidency was in many respects a continuation of the policies of george w bush something many linetoeing democrats refuse to acknowledge and so far trumps presidency has been a continuation of obamas policies with the exception of stopping the tpp at least with respect to the war on terror and drone strikes the article lays that all out pretty clearly
socialism,not_removed,yeah lets just ignore all the wars republican and democrats have started you heard it here folks only two deaths in history were ever caused by republicans or democrats
socialism,not_removed,i doubt theyre actually posting here in the pursuit of knowledge and that they would actually listen in good faith trolls gonna troll best to ban them and move on with it
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately i probably know more than you and unfortunately im not banned
socialism,not_removed,very kind of you to say so thanks
socialism,not_removed,well of course news are a valuable tool in controlling your citizen´s as long as you get at least most of them it doesnt matter what anybody else knows especially foreign people if they complain just focus on whatever is their worst trait and make them the next enemy
socialism,not_removed,this is hell our tax dollars are being used to murder innocents and nearly everyone just lives their lives dependent on flat screens that feed them a sanitized narrative that actually supports the murderers all while the fruit of their labor is packaged up and sent to the other side of the world in a bomb and in the end most people cant be bothered to care as long as they are warm and their bellies are full
socialism,not_removed,bingo coverage of yemen until very recently in the us was pretty much zero despite the fact that they had an ongoing civil war on the one hand thats on us for not seeking more information about what the us was doing but the media has far more power and authority than we do to break and spread such information
socialism,not_removed,good point thats even farther removed than collateral damage damage has an inherently negative quality while strike doesnt eg striking a ball in a sport is often a positive but damaging a ball is clearly bad so the language being used to describe killing people has removed all negative qualities to the phrase thats some serious doublespeak
socialism,not_removed,im sick of hearing about the haves and the havenots have some personal accountability the biggest problem with the way that we are doing things is the more we let you have the less that ill be keeping for me the whole year zero album is pretty relevant to this sub actually lots of class consciousness in there god i love nin
socialism,not_removed,trump and hillary are effectively the same way too many people
socialism,not_removed,lots of trump supporters pointed to his alleged noninterventionism to lure ignorant liberals and libertarian types into supporting him
socialism,not_removed,perfect setup for kanye in

socialism,not_removed,trump has also replaced the joint chiefs and head of intelligence with actual neofascist steve bannon on the national security council an unprecedented move theyre also seeking ways to reopen cia black torture sites and reinstate torture in general including methods worse than waterboarding these are pretty major differences also equating the muslim ban and refugee ban to what obama did is frankly irresponsible can we please keep things in perspective and in context obama never implemented anything so sweeping and transparently discriminatory
socialism,not_removed,my comment is reactionary trash
socialism,not_removed,i think we should be a bit more aware of how deep the indoctrination goes ive just recently within the past year began questioning things like this i was raised and live in appalachia in the heart of the bible belt and a lot of us here are essentially taught not to question authority often based on biblical misunderstandings this of course doesnt excuse the ignorance as im disgusted at the things i believed and bought into even as recent as a year ago i have no idea how to go about making others understand and overcome their ignorance but the indoctrination in at least appalachian america is ridiculous
socialism,not_removed,from cradle to grave people are constantly being bombarded with media and other methods to reinforce current institutions and ideological consensus its good of you to so publically whip yourself about white privilege but i think youre underestimating how easy it is to extract yourself from such a bombardment it takes large amounts of time and the opportunities to use that time to develop a sophisticated criticism of society in the face of such a strong force to just go along and agree not everyone has the privilege to read their marx or whatever the attitude that anyone who disagrees with you is purposefully deluding themselves out of selfishness is absolutely toxic what about working class black people who defend the obama administration im sure they exist are they refusing to question the political order that benefits them obviously not because people can disagree with socialism without being intellectually dishonest in order to protect whatever benefits they receive from the current system if socialisms aim is to convince people and build counterhegemony its going to have to be far more openminded than youre being right now you disagree with me because youre consciously refusing to recognise im right as the only possible explanation for somewhat not agreeing with you is fundamentally counter productive and antisocialist
socialism,not_removed,this thread made it to rall and im not familiar with this sub so bear with me can you briefly explain this subssocialisms stance on the appropriate use of military force when to use it how to use it etc i ask because there are differences as small as they might be between the policies of bush and obama regarding military action and what to use when i assume trump will also have differences
socialism,not_removed,strawmen are alive and well in socialism i see
socialism,not_removed,суцк ми баллс
socialism,not_removed,oh who have you read then
socialism,not_removed,how is socialism not the answer then unfortunately im not banned uh yeah you seem really mature and open to dialogue probably know more about socialism that people on a socialist forum too sure
socialism,not_removed,the biggest lie that modern democracies believe is that they have no propaganda system in place
socialism,not_removed,were you around at all since the
socialism,not_removed,aljazeera english does a pretty good coverage of yemen
socialism,not_removed,right we dont have to see it honestly we have to go out of our way to read about it so theres multiple levels of distancing here you have the commander of the military more removed because they dont have to consider risking their own people as much people controlling the drones or deploying them are more removed because they do not have to look their targets into the eye or pull the trigger really themselves the people at home are more removed because their friends and family are not being deployed as often or in combat as often accountability is something so rare in american culture
socialism,not_removed,heres a httpstheinterceptcomdronepapersavisualglossary of some of these dehumanizing terms that were found in drone docs people are no longer people theyre objectives bombers are birds assassinations are jackpots if you havent i suggest everyone here read the drone papers about obamas assassination complex
socialism,not_removed,easily his best work postfragile
socialism,not_removed,im so happy to see people referencing lesserknown nin works on here that album is excellent and sadly its relevant again
socialism,not_removed,year zero was how i got into nin
socialism,not_removed,yall think this is some gotcha when its selfcentered if youre a palestinian or a yemeni or anyone else living in the global south the result is the same for you clinton would have kept bombing these places just as much as trump is going to were antiimperialists here and we have an internationalist outlook for the worlds most vulnerable people who are hurting the most there isnt a difference between trump and clinton one is just more outwardly racist but the result is exactly the same
socialism,not_removed,true
socialism,not_removed,tbh i legit wonder if kanye wouldnt be a better president at this point
socialism,not_removed,im no killer i also am not american or a gunowning constitutionalist if i were either of the three trump would not have lived past the primary
socialism,not_removed,something tells me that wasnt the intent
socialism,not_removed,trump has also replaced the joint chiefs and head of intelligence with actual neofascist steve bannon on the national security council an unprecedented move fair point theyre also seeking ways to reopen cia black torture sites and reinstate torture in general including methods worse than waterboarding these are pretty major differences i dont think theres any reason to believe that america ever stopped using torture this bit reminds of me of the nondifference between the administrations bush and obama where the former was more openly supportive of torture and the latter claimed to try to put a stop to it but there was still torture granted trump may try to implement worse forms of torture though he will have to fight the military and courts in this regard but its still either a continuation or expansion of existing policy not a radical departure from it also equating the muslim ban and refugee ban to what obama did is frankly irresponsible can we please keep things in perspective and in context keeping things in perspective and context is exactly what im trying to do im trying to show how a lot of what trump is doing including the muslim ban didnt start with trump granted what trump has done now is significantly worse but it is again the next big step in an existing policy that has been around since bush ii and expanded by obama
socialism,not_removed,fuck obama and fuck trump both would have my ass bombed if it proved beneficial to capital
socialism,not_removed,fantastic comment we cant forget that all these movements are supposed to be for the people it makes no sense for us throw our hands up in frustrationangerwhatever if those we aim to helpliberate are in need of some more education no one said this would be easy i think you hit the nail on the head with privilege too i know i wouldnt think how i do without the freedom to be critical that i was afforded while growing up and going to college
socialism,not_removed,the sorts of pundits making six figures for their political opinions who refuse to accept that the democratic party has failed and other informed partisan hacks are more who im talking about
socialism,not_removed,this sub is not consistent on use of military force hell a lot of people here dont believe in militaries at all but most accept their necessity when everyone else has them generally the idea of sending your army to the arse end of none of your business and shaking up an islamist sectarian hornets nest and occasionally bombing civilians in the area to secure your oil interests isnt exactly smiled upon
socialism,not_removed,im not particularly well qualified to speak to this but generally everyone here is against pretty much all forms of military force used on the part of the west as well as russia china and any other militaristic nation most people here would probably see it as elites from various capitalist powers using their military might for their own selfish and sociopathic expansion of power be it corporate power or national power and necessarily sending working class people to fight be traumatized dismembered andor die as for an appropriate use of military force that starts to get complex and it a depends on how you define military and b depends on what kind of socialism were talking about some socialists would say that violence is a horrible idea in pretty much any scenario as it always involves the working class and poor fighting and that socialism should be enacted through reforms a lot of revolutionary socialists disagree strongly with that saying that elites will never allow socialism to come about through reform and fully support a militant though not necessarily military uprising of the working class in order to overthrow the ruling elites and institute a socialist revolution in some cases they want this revolution to be worldwide in which case maybe there could be military action but only if it were to try to overthrow capitalism and institute socialism personally i see it both ways and have no idea what the best path is but in general i definitely dont want anyone to have to go fight in a war given how fucking horrifically god damn terrible it is for everyone involved

socialism,not_removed,stick to public or nonprofit news sources from countries outside the one you want to know about then amalgamate sources and compare that is how you find out what is happening in the world
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,drone pilots themselves actually have high rates of ptsd and other mental health issues but otherwise yeah
socialism,not_removed,for that matter look at the title of this post the choice of kill instead of murder is in the same vein and what else could you call shooting an eightyearold and leaving them to bleed to death
socialism,not_removed,while thats absolutely true letting trump in has pretty well stopped any chance of a proper progressive movement in the next years for the us without a violent overthrow of the system at least with clinton we mightve had the chance to get a centrist to centreleft administration in that we could get bills and shit through and then had another chance years later to elect a candidate who veers further towards the left side of politics eg bernie
socialism,not_removed,i dont think theres any reason to believe that america ever stopped using torture there is much reason to believe it obama closed the black sites and this is why the memo leaking out of the new administration discusses the desire to either circumvent or change the law if we were still torturing people there would be no need for that as for the rest ill just say that i generally object to the logic that says if a policy isnt an entirely different kind of thing then its reasonable to cast it as nothing really new different or alarming when you start saying well back in year x president soandso did something kinda a similar the message you send even if unintentionally is this is normal nothing to see here folks meanwhile fascism is moving to normalize open persecution of muslims and immigrants case in point ben shapiro shit heel has made the exact same argument you are making equating obamas much narrower suspension of the refugee program to trumps sweeping transparently antiislamic travel restrictions and general slamming of the door on refugees now without questioning your intentions id suggest that suddenly finding yourself echoing the likes of shapiro should suffice to give you pause is this really the argument you want to be making right now who is it helping
socialism,not_removed,im not disagreeing with that
socialism,not_removed,i appreciate the response i dislike conflating all military action as being equally reprehensible but its more understandable if youre standing on the far end of a field and watching two people in the middle argue that a couple inches left or right makes them superior
socialism,not_removed,i appreciate the response would cyber warfare fall into the category of military force for an example if two sovereign nations targeted government infrastructure plus corporate cyber infrastructure based in the respective countries you can answer from your personal perspective or not at all of course
socialism,not_removed,it didnt really one service member killed five injured one plane destroyed intelligence material we gathered might have been worth it but who knows
socialism,not_removed,you might want to try the video game bioshock for a slightly more literarily accomplished version
socialism,not_removed,communismsocialism attempts to work against our natural instincts do you really think its this simple like you have just debunked decades and decades of literature as if this isnt not addressed on the theory of communism and youve somehow figured out the weak point of it at last debunking it and here i am assuming you mean that these natural instincts is that were greedy selfish etc so even if what you said were true if those are our instincts would you rather them just flourish instead of trying to stabilize them would you rather people exploit hordes of humans abuse people rather than at least have a shot at fighting against that and as we can see from history has disastrous outcomes thats not what i get from history communism achieved many many great things on the places it was attempted on even when it lived in a world in which everyone else was fighting against it even if it was a complete disaster disaster is the very thing that has happened with the many forms capitalism has taken throughout the centuries so i dont see this as a point against communism agree with this last part
socialism,not_removed,dae hooman natur
socialism,not_removed,can you explain to me what about it works against human nature
socialism,not_removed,who are you quoting and any sites you can recommend that match that criteria ive found the intercept to be phenomenal but they have limited coverage and dont match your criteria
socialism,not_removed,sorry to discount that i did not mean to imply anyone on this chain was impervious to feeling the repercussions of these actions or to be deeply affected by them i meant that there is a different context with drones thank you for pointing that out
socialism,not_removed,i think its the other way around the left wouldve stagnated and gotten complacent under a clinton presidency whereas were basically living accelerationism right now with trmp
socialism,not_removed,good im tired of the usa throwing its weight around in other contries and having so called progressives not giving a fuck with clinton i would have been bombed regardless if it proved beneficial to capital
socialism,not_removed,if youre really an anarchist you wouldnt be arguing for reformism
socialism,not_removed,thats true stuff like tcd and his early media appearances shows hes concerned about racism and the vanity of the upper class and some of yeezus implies that but then hell act contrary to that like being all buddy buddy with orange cheeto i just dont get ye as much as i love him it seems like hes vastly different from what he shows outwardly is the closest weve gotten to the real yeezy
socialism,not_removed,if you actually believe george soros is paying people to protest i have some buckets of freeze dried survival food i wanna sell you
socialism,not_removed,ive posted here for a while and still soros hasnt paid me a cent what gives
socialism,not_removed,there is much reason to believe it obama closed the black sites and congress outlawed torture in this is why the memo leaking out of the new administration discusses the desire to either circumvent or change the law if we were still torturing people there would be no need for that i truly hope youre correct here its not like i want the us to be torturing people its just that from what ive read the us or at least some parts of it has never been against secretly and illegally torturing people as far as i know they were doing it before bush iis administration came up with legal justifications for openly authorizing it and even now that those are closed theyre probably back to doing it secretly but im admittedly relying on supposition here as for the rest i apologize if im not clear in my intentions in point out these similarities between obama and trumps administrations im not trying to say its reasonable to cast these things as nothing new different or alarming im trying to say that they are and have always been deeply horrifically alarming perhaps im haphazardly assuming that just because im in rsocialism people will understand my meaning its just really worrying that people are just now starting to get up in arms about it even here right as the president switched from a republican to a democrat one of the biggest most disappointing and cynical political awakenings for me was realizing how much the general discussion in the united states flipped sides once obama became president with bush ii everyone around me being that i live in a significantly democratic liberal region of the country was constantly critical of all of the things he was doing including the invasions the erosion of rights the persecution and killing of muslims and so on then obama came to power and starting doing the same god damned things bush was doing and the indignation mostly disappeared suddenly it was the republicans who were chiding the president and the democrats were applauding him or making excuses for all of the shitty things he did and now with trump its happening all over again yes its different in that theres a lot of things trump and his administration are doing that are notably worse or more worrying than when obama or bush were president this particular example with banning immigration from specific muslimmajority countries is a significant step in a horrifying wrong direction i want to be clear about that but its not like it happened in a vacuum the persecution of muslims has been on going since before and was continuously expanding under the presidencies of bush and obama but the majority of the groups who are protesting trump now were largely silent with obama even as he was committing warcrimes and atrocities the likes of which are significantly worse than this immigration ban doesnt that seem really really disquieting to you so when people suddenly get up in arms about stuff trump is doing but are ideologically inconsistent when it was about obama it makes all the anger and outrage seem disingenuous and opportunistic which is no grounds for having a productive discussion we need to be forthcoming and honest about all of the things that got us here otherwise were doomed to repeat the same destructive delusional pattern the country has been trapped in for decades making trump out to be this horrible devil hitler monster thats so so much worse than anything before plays right into the delusion worst of all it diminishes and undermines the legitimate criticisms of him which im sure you agree are of the utmost importance theres even been a degree of this in rsocialism a community centered on a philosophy that generally is highly critical of democrats as well as republicans im hoping i can help restore some perspective to the situation so we can have some clarity about it also regarding ben shapiro also making this argument the funny thing though not really ha ha funny is that were both saying that everyone was more okay was this shit when the other guy was doing it and were both basically correct it does give me pause but not because im aligned with shapiro which of course im not but rather because that means that the people who disagree with him based on his reasoning are doing so on ideologically inconsistent grounds which makes shapiro look like the guy whos on point especially to people who are already feel favorably towards trump this is but one example of why arguments against trump and his policies need to be consistent and fully acknowledging the reality of the past if you made it this far thanks for sticking with me
socialism,not_removed,well for example i think everyone here would agree that the goal of being punch fascists would be about as good a justification as any but the pithy cover the establishment gives for what is a resource war holds no water
socialism,not_removed,again it depends on whos doing it and for what purpose in this regard i dont see cyber warfare being all that different from regular warfare though it is generally less gruesome
socialism,not_removed,literature proves nothing in the real world this isnt philosophy this is realtime politics and economics and sure if people could mass stabilize these feelings of greed we should but sadly were unable to make everyone perfect which is why we saw corrupt socialist governments in the century alongside citizens pretty much unwilling and unable to change to the perfect man required by a communist structure communism achieved nothing good in the real world it caused hundreds millions of deaths because leaders everywhere thought they would be able to conquer our most primal instincts of social groups and of ownership capitalism isnt great but its much better than any of the currently present alternatives
socialism,not_removed,great reply i can tell you thought a lot about this
socialism,not_removed,humans are inherently greedy and pretty much all communist theories and layouts exist in a perfect world with perfect people unfortunately that isnt the case as history has taught us
socialism,not_removed,which country is the event you want to know more about occurring in
socialism,not_removed,okay i understand where you are coming from and i do agree that its crucially important to connect trump with recent american history since as you rightly point out thats precisely where he came from this is a delicate thing though yes theres a lot of apparent contradictions and hypocrisy in american political discourse which emerge from the powerful identification people develop with the two major parties but simply pointing out the hypocrisy wont necessarily get us where wed like to go if someone strongly identified with obama and believes he was great we will not convince them otherwise by framing the actions of trump who they despise as a kind of continuation of what obama did what you do in that situation is force them to reconcile their justified hatred of trump with his similarities to obama that can be achieved in a few different ways shoot the messenger these socialists just think everyone is just as bad as everyone else they think obama and trump are the same theyre so stupidcrazyignorantnihilisticwhatever negative selfdoubt well hm maybe i am judging trump a little too harshly maybe this isnt so different and urgent as i thought maybe ill take a step back and see what happens positive selfdoubt hey wait a minute this isnt really about trump or obama exactly theyre just cogs in a big horrible machine that can have no real good guys viva la revolucion youre hoping for shapiro is banking on honestly i think shapiro is making the better bet and he knows how to do that because this kind of rhetorical partisan gamesmanship is the cynical stuff upon which present day american conservatism is built this is his game and as socialists i think our only real hope is to refuse to play rather stand up and turn over the game board what i mean is that we shouldnt worry about how trump compares to obama at all the moderate left is incensed by trump who is a neofascist and even if that justifiably strikes us as hypocritical so what let them keep their fantasy of obama because it makes no difference its as vague and distant to them as hope and change not related to much policy substance and where it is related to policy at all mostly connects with the supposed intent of those policies like the aca where we are in general agreement anyway their hatred of trump is enough trump is an incredible gift to leftwing propaganda hes literally an egomaniacal capitalist billionaire who inherited his fortune and made even more money lying cheating and screwing over working people hes so committed to his own enrichment that hes refused to step away from his personal business dealings even as president hes so callous and twisted that he doesnt hesitate to wear his disdain for human life on his sleeve all of this and he is now the standard bearer of the right what more could we ask for meanwhile the democrats have essentially disappeared not knowing what to do now that their neoliberal politics have become a thirdrail as people take to the streets in righteous anger what remains of the democratic elite sit by in apparent stunned silence the stage sits empty and inviting to anyone bold enough to shape the growing mass movement to dismantle a sitting president this is not an opportunity we can afford to squander by hopelessly trying to pry democrats away from their idolization of obama at least not in a direct way nor do we need to obamas legacy is no threat to us instead let us connect trump with less dearly held but much more fundamental issues of exploitation state violence and the necessity of a real proletarian movement to seize control of the state we dont need to convince them obama is evil we just need to guide them to the right reasons for believing trump is evil if we succeed in that they will come to judge obama appropriately all on their own

socialism,not_removed,makes sense i was just generally curious thank you
socialism,not_removed,there was military intelligence they had to physically pick up i dont think anybody without a security clearance knows if it was a person documents hard drive or what whatever they were looking for might have also not been there which would make this a complete disaster
socialism,not_removed,literature proves nothing in the real world this isnt philosophy this is realtime politics and economics where do you think any economicpolitical model comes from they cant be written which is why we saw corrupt socialist governments in the century alongside citizens pretty much unwilling and unable to change to the perfect man required by a communist structure well we just disagree on this then although id recommend reading on dialectical materialism in case youre interested to know on how communism addresses this issue communism achieved nothing good in the real world yes it did in fact how can a political system not achieve anything good at all this statement is proven fallacious by its mere existence id say even as a communist id admit that for example fascism has good things it caused hundreds millions of deaths yeah try adding yet another hundred on that phrase maybe a billion everyone knows communism is the devil billions and billions i say billions and billions i take it youre a capitalist how do you reconcile the constant exploitation of nations the people kept in suffering in purpose the billions that have died because of capitalism with this idea that communism kills so many how is capitalism better than communism in that regard
socialism,not_removed,karl marx is listed among the founding fathers of sociology for his input on the subject to think he wouldnt consider human nature is a little silly human beings have needs and actively seek to fulfil those needs this coupled with the human as a social animal means that in a society where accumulation of goods is a sign of success humans will seek to accumulate goods as part of a subconscious need to prove themselves amongst the group observations of this relationship referring to it as greed socialism social ownership of productive means contrast with nationalization by the state and by extension its expected endpoint in communism a classless stateless moneyless society do address human nature by creating a society based around cooperative organization of production in a stateless environment communists seek to change what it takes for the social animal that is man to prove itself amongst its peers from accumulation of goods the vast wealth inequality as we know it rendered impossible in such a circumstance to participation in social labor your arguments against communism as history has taught us isnt an argument against communism at all the communist states of russia and china being little more than highly advanced forms of the big government capitalist welfare state like an extreme scandinavian social democracy where the capitalist was merely the state apparatus itself i hope youll forgive the length but id like to quote a paragraph where lenin himself criticized such things thusly here was have what is most essential in the theoretical appraisal of the latest phase of capitalism ie imperialism namely that capitalism becomes monopoly capitalism the latter must be emphasized because the erroneous bourgeois reformist assertion that monopoly capitalism or statemonopoly capitalism is no longer capitalism but can now be called state socialism and so on is very common the trusts of course never provided do not now provide and cannot provide complete planning but however much they do plan however much the capitalist magnates calculate in advance the volume of production on a national and even on an international scale and however much they systematically regulate it we still remain under capitalismat its new stage it is true but still capitalism without a doubt the proximity of such capitalism to socialism should serve genuine representatives of the proletariat as an argument proving the proximity facility feasibility and urgency of the socialist revolution and not at all as an argument for tolerating the repudiation of such a revolution and the efforts to make capitalism look more attractive something which all reformists are trying to do
socialism,not_removed,im pretty north american centric
socialism,not_removed,thanks for the thoughtful response i generally agree especially with the way in which the democratic party is disintegrating and the opportunity that arises from that
socialism,not_removed,was the objective only to retrieve intel them killing aq makes me doubt that its astounding how disinterested the american public are in details of military actionsand subsequently you used to and accept not having a lot of info released about them
socialism,not_removed,where do you think any economicpolitical model comes from they cant be written they can be written of course but the theories have no true value in the real world until they are tried communism has been tried and has failed many times yes it did in fact how can a political system not achieve anything good at all well im sure it achieved something but those slight achievements have been greatly overshadowed by all the damage it caused yeah try adding yet another hundred on that phrase maybe a billion everyone knows communism is the devil billions and billions i say billions and billions so what youre just saying we ignore the damage caused by communism thats as ignorant as ignoring the damage caused by fascism in the century which im sure you dont do you sound like one of those holocaust deniers who makes fun of the statistic of million who died i take it youre a capitalist i wouldnt really say im a capitalist by choice but over any of the currently present alternatives i accept it its not perfect but with good policies and leaders it can be manageable and somewhat ethical
socialism,not_removed,good point i cant say i disagree with most of that i suppose our difference lies in the fact that you have more hope in humanity being able to get to a stage where no classes exist while im pretty certain it would just fall into another mess like the ussr im not trying to be nihilistic i just dont believe humans are able to sustain themselves in a communist society either as leaders or as citizens i have nothing against communism in terms of theory i just think its harmful and dangerous to try to establish in the real world as we have seen throughout history
socialism,not_removed,the nonnot for profit portion is to minimize the potential for financial conflicts of interest conglomerates who own companies not reporting negatively about them etc bbc is usually a good source for us reporting the intercept is fine for most things in the us
socialism,not_removed,thank you as well i feel like this exchange helped clarify my own thoughts a bit
socialism,not_removed,had to be intel the other option is that there were american boots on the ground for literally no reason its most likely that it was heavily guarded intel there are very good reasons for keeping military actions classified in this case the details are not being release because the intel gained will be used in followup actions or because it was a failure and they dont want to admit it
socialism,not_removed,they can be written of course but the theories have no true value in the real world until they are tried communism has been tried and has failed many times everything has been tried and has failed if the goal is to have the majority of the population on earth have a decent life so if it has failed or not is not a good metric to measure the value of the theory so what youre just saying we ignore the damage caused by communism thats as ignorant as ignoring the damage caused by fascism in the century which im sure you dont do you sound like one of those holocaust deniers who makes fun of the statistic of million who died im saying im guessing that youre just parroting what the propaganda has told you and dont know the context of those deaths the meaning of the number nor the many things communism achieved i also am not sure if youre aware how much suffering capitalism has caused and keeps causing every second so when you say that communism killed a lot of people so does capitalism its like youre ignoring that part or is it a thing about numbers and you think its way less for capitalism i wouldnt really say im a capitalist by choice but over any of the currently present alternatives i accept it its not perfect but with good policies and leaders it can be manageable and somewhat ethical then youre a capitalist also what is not perfect about it to you and how can it be ethical if it requires people to be in poverty earning minimum wage working awful jobs without a chance to improve and it requires workers not to keep the full extent of their labor
socialism,not_removed,could be a killcapture mission im not talking about the content of the documents im talking more details about the raid illustrations objectives etc
socialism,not_removed,well i dont know what the consensus is here but to me this isnt some controversial darwinian new outlook on the left its just the left deny human nature i feel like this is a misconception people acquire when we say that human nature is defined by material conditions we dont claim human nature doesnt exist we claim that the reactionary conception of human nature that humans are greedy selfish and such is not in fact human nature but the way humans are forced to behave in a system that makes you ratrace your fellow man for existance instead of cooperating if you look at kropotkin for example he was very much interested in human nature and evolution and through his observations pointed out that mutualism is as big a factor in natural selection as is competition having a competitive instinct for survival is of course also integral as you need a sense of individualism and self worth so you can be a functioning individual but selfproclaimed socialdarwinists usually overemphasise this a good example of this are the kind of people who read the selfish gene and somehow found in it an excuse to act like sociopaths not seeing that trying to pull a complete moral philosophy out of evolution is just as short sighted as trying to find it in a holy book we should use our understanding of evolution to study our natural boundries yes but only the same way we study gravity and air resistance so we can know how to fly we need to organize in a way that akcnowledges our nature and helps us prosper by utilizing it theres a nice video called climate change and taylor swifts legs by the school of life that sort of delves into this also the concept that humans are ultracompetitive is just wrong usually selfproclaimed social darwinists have a very basic understanding of evolutionary science if you look at a progression of our societies you can see a decline in inequality and hierarchy as we go from slave societies over feudalism to capitalism humans have always had a disdain for hierarchy and in a recent study it was observed that chimp tribes start to behave much more healthily and show more care for women and children when the alpha male is removed and thus a more linear society established it is proposed that it may be exactly this that separated early human tribes from chimp tribes and allowed us to get to where we are
socialism,not_removed,peter singer flair says hedonistic utilitarianism checks out
socialism,not_removed,this is the best tldr i could make reduced by im a bot a socioeconomic background can increase her risk for unintended pregnancy although there is no difference between the sexual activity of black and white women the report did note differences in their contraception use which may account for racial disparities in unintended pregnancy rates the report concluded that relying on condoms alone for pregnancy prevention likely contributed to disadvantaged and black higher risk of unintended pregnancy version tldrs so far pms and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome top keywords
socialism,not_removed,i just want to say im fucking sick of fighting with twitter nazis theyre practically pissing themselves with joy over one of the quebec shooters being muslim pieces of racist fucking shit edit the muslim man has been confirmed as innocent so now theyre just choosing to ignore facts typical
socialism,not_removed,to any comrades in california right now hows the calexit thing perceived by actual residents its my belief that if that succeeds and california actually leaves the union that state will be the flashpoint needed to set up a strong socialist state its already left wing just have to push a little further rather than taking baby steps it has a huge economy bigger than france it has the technology and it has the cultural ties so if socialism flourishes there it can be seen as a working system by everyone who owns a television or goes to the movies
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,should we or shouldnt we try to build a broad coalition including nonsocialists at least for the next half decade i feel like there are many leaders of organized religion the monarchy think prince charles and even moderate capitalists like zuckerberg gates cuban etc who share many of our concerns even though they are anathema to many socialist doctrines i feel like before we can talk about creating a socialist world in which clintons are considered right wing we need to ensure that humanity and civilization survive the trump years and we need to focus on existential irreversible threats like nuclear war climate change and economic collapse
socialism,not_removed,i just recently subbed and although i agree with most things here blm anttrump etc some of the stuff seemstoo ravenous i am all for the resistance in any way possible but with all the cop hate it seems almost like anarchy not socialism albeit i suppose they are similar didnt the police and military assist lenin in his revolt or am i mistaken i feel like sometimes people on this sub lump the actions of the individual to the group something we detest and something i may be doing now is it normal to agree with most things here or am i a dirty liberal spy
socialism,not_removed,fyi thats not even true
socialism,not_removed,this is the very first im hearing about any of this can you give a brief rundown
socialism,not_removed,sounds cool but werent we warned by lenin etc that a lone socialist state wouldnt work what about the other states let us join you
socialism,not_removed,similar things have been done before in germany and suffice it to say that it was a terrible mistake when you strengthen socalled moderates they take everything you give them and the second that they are on top they turn on the left
socialism,not_removed,thats a horrible idea we shouldnt be siding with either side of the national populism vs neoliberalism antagonism those people do not have the same concerns as we do the threat of economic collapse climate change and nuclear war can not be wiped out without wiping out capitalism and i doubt prince charles and bill gates are going to be happy about the abolition of capitalism
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately theyre capitalists that make up the ruling class which enforces capitalism they arent capable of proletarian class consciousness because of their vested interest in profiting from wage theft bill gates is using technocracy to weaken public schools zuckerburg is literally suing to steal land at dirt cheap prices from hawaiians prince charles has done nothing to stop thatcherism or the attack against old labour luckily there are more of us proletarians than capitalists we just need to wake them up from the matrix d during the bush years we lost whatever work we had done because our movement became anybody but bush and survive bush i agree with you that we must fight for justice and climate change because of this i think youll like murray bookchin a lot heres a good article summarizing his views
socialism,not_removed,supposedly people are forming a political group called the californian national party which has the sole purpose of passing a referendum in to start a referendum strange i know to leave the union think about it like the vote scotland attempted to leave the uk it has a large twitter following and it seems more and more likely with everything the current administration is doing if sessions were to declare recreational weed unlawful federally its a sure thing
socialism,not_removed,thats fucking awesome thanks for the information solidarity with the cnp
socialism,not_removed,where is the torrent
socialism,not_removed,httpimgurcomarvvkp yes imgur fucked up the order but its ui is so wonky im not even going to try to fix it the shots of just the media are outside the police station after the protest had marched on the protest marched to broadway to protest at the spot olango was shot
socialism,not_removed,if he really was having an episode we can partially thank the lanterman petris short act and governor ronald reagan for terminating the public mental health infrastructure imperfect as it wasa template that was applied across the country as that governor became leader of the world california uber alles we can also thank the enforcement policy handed down from city managers to patrolmen making them into something like an invisible human wall while standing in as the mental health first responders in the wake of the aforementioned infrastructure termination these patrolmen are asked by a wolf at their familys door to keep this invisible wall strong and invisible new duties and quotas added every day see adrian schoolcraft truth is the unions hate stop and frisk they hate harassing peaceful protesters and they hate being given such tasks by city managers and their stooge the chief its management labor relations brimming with cracks and opportunities for organizers who can see past their own justified anger
socialism,not_removed,lets talk more about class and less about race were socialists not blm sure well address their problems but we are more interested in the root of these problems
socialism,not_removed,we dont need to sacrifice one for the other we can talk about race and class and while class will always be the centerpiece race issues should be talked about as well
socialism,not_removed,are you serious these people deserve to die in the meantime while we focus on other issues we can do both but i dont know about you youre no comrade of mine
socialism,not_removed,lets talk more about class and less about race lets not were socialists not blm speak for yourself bro
socialism,not_removed,youre brocialist trash and your attitude is a huge part of the ongoing deterioration of race relations in the us
socialism,not_removed,spot the whitie
socialism,not_removed,playing devils advocate here whenever the police encounter someone who is unstable neoliberal police doctrine is to use excessive force and to feel absolutely no remorse for killing whether their target is black white or whatever we should distinguish classism from racism rather than just assume that whenever a black man is killed it is always because the cop is a white supremacist alone of course psychiatry itself as it is practiced in neoliberal societies is screamingly racist as anyone with sufficient experience in the system can tell you and like many things in neoliberalism racism is always implied im just saying that it isnt the entire story and we ought to be looking at police and social policy directed towards those deemed mentally unsound first and how that is responsible for rampant abuse
socialism,not_removed,you showed him
socialism,not_removed,i apologize for this stain on my race
socialism,not_removed,you have no place here i deal with my boss treating my black coworkers and good friends like shit every day and it makes me want to break down in rage some days dont try and explain away race like you know any fucking thing about what black comrades go through in the us if you had a shred of empathy youd understand how ignorant you are being youre not a leftist
socialism,not_removed,this seems wrong to me on several levels i dont think anyone should feel responsible for the actions of another if the sole connecting factor between the two is race i dont think it is even possible to be a stain on the race you were born into racism is certainly real but its a social construct just the same as race itself is theres nothing innate and deterministic about race identity it only exists in the differences and divisions that have been enforced through systems of oppression apologies should be reserved for things you are personally responsible for i dont see why you should feel personally responsible for some other random person on the internet whose only characteristic you share is that youre both white
socialism,not_removed,theyre not even hiding anymore this is happening in plain sight
socialism,not_removed,socialism venezuela pick one
socialism,not_removed,you see its all about perception trump rails against the globalists ie jews and convinces people hes not a neoliberal when hes the worst the world has ever seen with putin not far behind bloodier towards dissidents maybe but less environmentally dangerous
socialism,not_removed,i had read it as nap for some reason
socialism,not_removed,well it must be because those million people deserve it for not bootstrapping hard enough s this fucking sucks they say socialism is inevitable not nessasarily there is still an offhand chance that we could destroy our planet when the last humans are around a fire and are asked what happened they will say we destroyed our planet and wiped up the human race but for a brief moment we didnt violate the nap
socialism,not_removed,communism killed about million people even if we look at the million capitalists often say it killed in an year time span they neglect to count the million or so people it killed as a result of war famine poverty and whatnot million children alone by how about we boost our million by slicing the heads off of the crapitalist swine
socialism,not_removed,i read this every night before i go to sleep not really
socialism,not_removed,for those who dont know peter taaffe is one of the founding members of the committee for a workers international of which the socialist party in the uk and socialist alternative in the us are a part paul mason is a former trotskyist turned social democrat
socialism,not_removed,paul mason is so goddamn insufferable
socialism,not_removed,paul workers bomb mason
socialism,not_removed,you can tell how much they hated living under him
socialism,not_removed,this is a beautiful sight also should serve as a relief for anyone who thought castros death could compromise the regime in cuba socialism lives on in cuba it lives on within its people
socialism,not_removed,‪look at these poor cubans worshipping a monster anyway off to the musical about a rapping slaveowner‬
socialism,not_removed,if these people are mourning castro its because he was a master of deceit and they are clearly brainwashed however if they are celebrating castros death then it is proof that castro was a brutal tyrant checkmate
socialism,not_removed,as it always did its reactionary to think one person however brilliant they are can carry a revolution
socialism,not_removed,hamilton didnt own slaves
socialism,not_removed,the goalposts have been moved so often theyre on the fucking moon at this point
socialism,not_removed,but it is a relief to see the popular support and to know its not only the state that claims to be socialist
socialism,not_removed,a revolution is never done by one person its doomed to fail otherwise a revolution is something everyone is a part of
socialism,not_removed,the family he marries into does
socialism,not_removed,which kim
socialism,not_removed,yes we have a lot to learn from them
socialism,not_removed,the only really legitimate reason that makes people consider it to be less of a democracy than for example the us are the limitations of freedom of press and expression one could argue that no country which limits its citizens rights to speak out and build opinion can truly be a democracy of course that would make a lot of other democratic countries nondemocratic aswell
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,why bother learning how to improve capitalist democracy when we should be thinking about how to abolish it
socialism,not_removed,nice arguments there here comes the ban hammer sickle 👌
socialism,not_removed,improve capitalist democracy i never said this
socialism,not_removed,i know i was being facetious if you think cuban democracy has any meaningful lessons on the subject of socialist democracy that any other capitalist democracy couldnt give us though i disagree
socialism,not_removed,cuban liberal democracy this is an untrue claim for anyone who has actually spent any time studying the cuban political system
socialism,not_removed,youre right im misusing the term liberal there apologies
socialism,not_removed,you did live up to your flair though so theres that
socialism,not_removed,coming from a libsoc i cant tell if thats intended as a compliment or not id like to assume the former because a libsoc thinking cuba is democratic would just be too much id laugh myself to death
socialism,not_removed,umassamherst is the goto for marxist pe in the usa i like to utilize their course syllabus syllabi when looking for new reading
socialism,not_removed,bilbao both barcelona universities pamplona any one in paris belgrade moscow lse cape town uct havana mexico city são paulo to name but a few all have strong revolutionary traditions and movements associated with them also theory without action is meaningless organise wherever you go
socialism,not_removed,going to a university wont help any paul mattick had something like a highschool education he was a factory worker starting at age
socialism,not_removed,duke has long had a notable marxist streak in some departments and they even offer an httpsliteraturedukeeducertificatesmarxismsociety is the director that puts them in a pretty unique politicalorganizing and cultural context seeing as theyre located in the south and half an hour from the former i guess postinauguration deathstar of american reactionary politics the nc state capitol in raleigh
socialism,not_removed,take a look at the school of oriental and african studies soas in london a couple years ago they were ranked the best poli sci undergrad in the uk did my ma there and its a great intimate school and seriously left wing it was founded in to prep new british imperialists to administer the colonies hence the archaic name and then swung in the exact opposite direction and now is a hub of postcolonial thought protests every other day tons of organisations great place
socialism,not_removed,i dont think i would want to go a university but ive always wanted to visit spain and learn more about the revolution ive always wanted to see the landscapes and see the history of the revolution firsthand plus spain looks gorgeous and looks like a place i could live out of my backpack for a while haha
socialism,not_removed,umass amherst alum here can confirm many good professors with many outstanding reading materials for their courses look into their stpec social thought and political economy program also they have a few excellent history professors like john bracey there is also an iso branch there and there is a very radical graduate student union with multiple marxists and other communists
socialism,not_removed,i am from são paulo and usp has leftist thought almost as tradition
socialism,not_removed,i mean venezuela would have to be socialist for socialism to tear it apart in the first place so
socialism,not_removed,are we still pretending that maduro is anything but an utterly incompetent administrator the man is a bus driver he doesnt know what he is doing
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,i should add the context that this is a response to that made the front page
socialism,not_removed,i agree nationalizing one industry doesnt make a socialist economy if anything this is a testament about the dangers of keeping a capitalist class i just think there should be more to the argument than thats socialist–no it isnt
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,this from what i understand there is plenty of blame to go around within the country just not at socialism itself as a concept also again im no expert here but the tipping point seemed to be when the government disregarded keynesian economics and their free markets collapsed right so its the capitalist side of things that shit the bed not boogeyman socialism
socialism,not_removed,i dont think the article implies that in fact it concedes that corruption is still a big problem in the government theres just more to the story than
socialism,not_removed,i just think there should be more to the argument than thats socialist–no it isnt i agree and apologies for the loweffort comment the article is excellent im just tired of socialism being the easy goto club to beat venezuela over the head with its bad for them its bad for us
socialism,not_removed,it just feels like a token well he is not perfect but we are still loyal to him adelante comandante the article fails to explain why this apparent economic warfare doesnt seem to be affecting ecuador which is doing more or less fine
socialism,not_removed,it seems httpoilpricecomenergyenergygeneralecuadorguttedbylowoilpricesrigcountdowntoonehtml i think one of venezuelas mistakes was the expectation that oil was going to solve all their problems and structured their government around that idea putting all their eggs in one basket
socialism,not_removed,ecuador is having troubles with oil but the country itself is holding venezuela meanwhile is almost collapsing
socialism,not_removed,as i said venezuelas structuring to rely almost solely oil for their social programs combined with the coordinated effort of the private sectors sabatoge as explained in the article has a lot to do with the crisis the point is there is a little more nuance than saying it was all maduro whose nepotism is certainly to blame as well
socialism,not_removed,this is hardly a new trend social democracy has been around since the second international there have always been people who wanted to make capitalism more tolerable to the working classes and thus stave off revolution for another five years people have been voting social democrats in to power for decades but people nowadays seem to have forgotten what utter failures they were
socialism,not_removed,you are making an important mistake yes socialdemocrats and democratic socialists have been around for literally more than a century however in many countries they have struggled to survive without having to drag themselves to the centre ever since the war but there seems to have been a resurgence politicians are doing pretty well on platforms which for quite some time would have made them unelectable the notion that people seem to have forgotten what utter failures they were ignores the fact that a not all people are socialists b parliamentary socialism while historically unsuccessful at bringing about actually existing socialism has granted workers important concessions that have made life tolerable and that shouldnt be dismissed
socialism,not_removed,there have always been people who wanted to make capitalism more tolerable to the working classes and thus stave off revolution for another five years and your alternative is what to make things as unlivable for the working class as possible and to let workers die miserably in order to get them to revolt
socialism,not_removed,b parliamentary socialism while historically unsuccessful at bringing about actually existing socialism has granted workers important concessions that have made life tolerable and that shouldnt be dismissed you just answered your question in a way these concessions are becoming smaller and smaller and that is why discontent with current situation in growing especially since crash when the target audience for these parliamentary socialists suffered the most liberal middle class and identity politics were just not enough anymore to keep them entertained politically
socialism,not_removed,yeah my experience with this commenter is that he lacks nuance which is what you also discovered here there has been a tilt to the left in some socialdemocratic parties corbyn and sanders although in a liberal party are examples of this the french presidential will be interesting to watch as the current socialliberal president is probably going to lose having mélenchon demsoc get to the second turn would be a sign that social democracy is moving left in western europe podemos and syriza are also some examples of such polarization of westernsouthern european politics
socialism,not_removed,stop it with your relentless dprkapologism actually no dprkadoration its creepy and no amount of creeching about muhr western propaganda will detract from its creepiness ive seen you post articles praising and defending the dprk before just educate yourself a hereditary monarchy with a castesystem where the workers are not only brutally subjugated but also dont own the means of production is many things but socialism it most certainly isnt you cant even say it was leftleaning in terms of issues of identitypolitics just look at the way the dprk upholds traditional genderroles and is essentially a very rigid patriarchal society this is like socialism christ
socialism,not_removed,i dont adore the dprk think every critique of it is western propaganda or care about whether you feel articles talking about it are creepy any criticisms or discussion of the actual interview are more than welcome hence the post—to discuss the interview and not me
socialism,not_removed,i dont adore the dprk think every critique of it is western propaganda so no critique of it can ever be genuine or sincere as it will obviously fall into western propaganda how very convenient and yes creepy discussion of the actual interview are more than welcome how about we dissect whos being interviewed in the article under contention minister of the embassy of the dprk i know what youre trying to do here youre trying to normalise yongo thae and his ideology by implying that his ideas are just like any others that theyre acceptable that theyre up for debate that theres a convincing proside argument in defence of jucheism this is a common tactic frequently employed by apologists authoritarianbootlickers and fascists of many varieties you wish to make arguments for them normalised by implying that these views can slot like any other view into ordinary discussion lets have a reasoned discussion about the holocaust lets have a reasoned discussion about mussolini lets have a reasoned discussion about north korea no im not playing your game post this crap in rpyongyang or some other tankie hellhole not here
socialism,not_removed,youre being extremely dishonest so this isnt worth discussing with you the fact that you outright ignored the dont part of my statement and twisted it to say i think every criticism of the dprk is western propaganda is dumbfounding again i dont adore the dprk think every critique of it is western propaganda or care about whether you feel articles talking about it are creepy notice that or of course you did or else youd have commented on how i care about your creepy feelings toward me
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,your statement here has poor grammar and was thus ambiguous in regards to its meaning it wouldve been clearer if you put nor do i in front of think every critique of it is western propaganda apologies here either way your post history demonstrates frankly dodgy political views
socialism,not_removed,hahaha that is fucking rich and about the response i expected when confronted with your twisting of my very clear statement you accuse me of not understanding english edit and then proceeded to add an apology after i point this out and attack me for not recognizing it not wasting any more time with you
socialism,not_removed,tankie dearest i did say apologies for misreading your statement either way you still wrote this unironically and yes to answer your rhetorical question in the above link yes critiquing the dprk would make you a fucking marvellous communist

socialism,not_removed,this is a very important topic i think that the election definitely increased the awareness of socialists as well as progressiveliberals and democratic centrists about the need to engage with the severe socioeconomic problems of rural and smalltown america httplegalruralismblogspotcom is a really excellent blog run by some academics that focus on rural issues in a very knowledgeable and indepth fashion its a great resource to learn more about the problems and potential solutions and general dynamics in these areas id recommend it to everybody httpswwwcolorlinescomarticlesopinionlookingleftwingruralpredominantlywhiteareas from colorlines talks about the rural leftwing it is coming from a somewhat liberal perspective but its still a very useful article and puts the spotlight on existing organizations doing the kind of work youre talking about here is a good excerpt today is a network of groups in small towns and rural areas around plus the small cities of salem and eugene rop is a multiracial organization although in practice it is majority white—just as the state is from the beginning it has always stressed a multiissue organizing weaving together economic demands with an emphasis on antiracist lgbtq and feminist issues rop works closely with another unusual oregon group pcun pineros y campesinos unidos del noroeste a majority latino farmworker union with strong progressive bent pcun also has a comprehensive political vision building farmworker housing advocating for all undocumented people and running a radio station although they dont receive much attention organized progressive groups do exist outside of the coasts in addition to oregons rop and tennessees venerable highlander school groups like the western states center project south kentuckians for the commonwealth statewide organizing for community empowerment iowa citizens for community improvement maine peoples alliance and the idaho community action network are based in rural areas or have chapters that are many rural groups are part of the new umbrella organization peoples action on the more radical side redneck revolt reaches out to workingclass whites with a combination of armed militancy and fierce antiracism
socialism,not_removed,i set up an organisation before christmas for this very thing at the moment were having a meeting in western massachusetts on the of february and we just had one in arkansas were fund raising soon for legal fees to get everything compliant and ready for whatever comes so we cant be shut down for silly legal shit you can find us on facebook fbmeruralworkers youll find our charter on there
socialism,not_removed,dont talk down to us if you want to help us make us partners in ideas dont act like youre going to be our saviors in any case do this with the urban proletariat too socialists arent our leaders and they never will be im socialist but a worker first id stand with my fellow proles against any opportunistic political group trying to use us as objects for their goals
socialism,not_removed,i believe the only way for socialism to penetrate the small towns in the bible belt is to radicalize christians while economic libertarianism is hegemonic many many people support the idea that it is the duty of the church to clothe and feed those in need and these people can be radicalized
socialism,not_removed,if youre into fb groups check out weird applachia kind of a ventingriffingbrainstorminglife affirming space for us rural lefties and cornbread communists has anyone taken steps to try to get local government or even charities and other nonprofits to give aid or change policy in ways that benefit rural americans honestly ppl have been trying to do that for years and it really does not succeed or it becomes coopted by business what would help our rural dwelling neighbors is helping to organize collectives around issues that effect the rural areas more acutely such as disability access and access to healthcare family planning and nutritional food im about to run off to an organizing thing so i dont have a lot of time to post will write more late pm me if you wanna chat
socialism,not_removed,these are great resources thank you i wasnt aware of any of those groups although i suspected something like them must exist im from western pennsylvania myself and i want to see if theres something similar out here
socialism,not_removed,i just liked the page
socialism,not_removed,yeahi really hate sounding condescending so i apologise if my post came off that way im not a strict socialist myself more anarchistleaning but i figure the one thing we all have in common is were screwed with things how they are and if we start helping each other out first we can try to have that conversation about whos really screwing us and what more we can do about it
socialism,not_removed,yep latino farm laborers and similar migrant workers in rural areas desperately need recruitment and organizing i think theyll take to it again quickly because they used to be heavily unioned pope francis has reemphasized the catholic idea of social welfare and inequality theres precedence given the historical popularity of socialism in central and south america so catholics will be easier since they believe in salvation through good deeds i dont know if thisll work for us protestants because they reject good deeds salvation they believe salvation only requires accepting jesus as their lord and personal savior theyre also entrenched in their belief in httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiprosperitytheology
socialism,not_removed,i sort of quit facebook last year although ive been thinking about coming back on at some pointif so ill check it out i figured getting that kind of assistance through the traditional route would have been tough although i had hopes that the general counterauthority wave people are riding now might be channeled to try again im not quite in a rural area myself so id kind of feel like an interloper trying to just visit and say hey i have ideas although im up for volunteering if somethings already off the ground
socialism,not_removed,from western pa myself though out of the area for school presently with pretty deep roots in the area and ruralsmalltown socialism is a huge issue for me so much of my research work has been on the history of radicalism related to our broader area my intention for a long time now has been that when i come back to pa i want to be able to organize the people i come from i truly believe pulling the rust belt and appalachian regions leftward away from trumpism is an absolutely crucial project right now solidarity to you edit my recommendation by the way is definitely to read up on the highlander center as mentioned above i think its model has a lot to offer im not as familiar with the other orgs mentioned but will look myself reading about other countries experiences might be valuable too in brazil for one as well as central america the comunidades de base represent a churchbased model for liberative politics in rural regions finally the labor history of our surrounding area is fascinating we cant let the legacies of the homestead strike the great railroad strike mother jones the wv mine wars and pittsburghs own be forgotten remembering and teaching our history is powerful in the midst of what feels like a hopeless time
socialism,not_removed,glad its useful if youre from western pennsylvania you might take some interest in the old radical history of that area that was where httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwhiskeyrebellion took place
socialism,not_removed,i like your smokey the bear pic
socialism,not_removed,the most important thing is what i said in my post i wasnt singling out your post as being condescending just letting you know in blunt terms whats going to get you somewhere near a receptive response and whats going to get you a boot in your ass
socialism,not_removed,good luck to you too
socialism,not_removed,id heard about that on a tour of wigle whiskey actually it also reminds me of my honeymoon in scotland where my wife and i learned about their resistance to whiskey bans and taxation from the english funny how so many governments seem to be intent on controlling independent alcohol production a lady in my writers group also recently selfpublished a book wrapped in smoke which touches on the johnstown floods and the subsequent strikes and anarchist demonstrations by the steelworkers there
socialism,not_removed,thanks for posting my article comrade
socialism,not_removed,that diamond ad made me puke
socialism,not_removed,with fifteen of the sixteen warmest years on record having occurred since the year with oceans both warming and acidifying and with unequivocal scientific evidence that burning fossil fuels is the principal cause – what can we do to rapidly reduce emissions this lecture revisits the mitigation agenda in light of the ipccs carbon budgets for °c arguing that whilst the science of climate change has progressed we obstinately refuse to acknowledge the rate at which our emissions from energy need to be reduced speculative negative emissions technologies have become de rigueur in balancing the escapism of incremental mitigation with rapidly dwindling °c carbon budgets similarly the eloquent rhetoric of green growth continues to eclipse quantitative analysis demonstrating the need for radical social as well as technical change taking these issues head on the lecture develops a quantitative framing of mitigation based on ipcc carbon budgets before finishing with more qualitative examples of what a genuine °c mitigation agenda may contain this is a hard critique of climate policies and western societies in general
socialism,not_removed,what is probably most terrifying about professor andersons talk is the fact that the market drives everything even the false scenarios you cant tell the truth if it hurts the markets
socialism,not_removed,the police in brazil is gruesome the são paulo state police alone killed more than the entire us police in a year their use of disproportionate violence is scary to the point where many people are more scary to run into a police patrol at night than at a robber
socialism,not_removed,i believe the term for this situation is freefire zone
socialism,not_removed,were no longer win make america great again
socialism,not_removed,jesus h christ on a crotch
socialism,not_removed,fuck the police in brazil but this is a total whitewashing of the atrocities committed by the assad regime murdered in the last years in syria not if brazils homicide rate was really higher than syrias wed be talking deaths a day not
socialism,not_removed,we actually fear cops just like robbers and that is one of the reasons for são paulo having the biggest paralel state of brazil
socialism,not_removed,for every four murders in são paulo one is attributes to its police and the ex secretary of public security is now the minister of justice it was under his command that the police increased those numbers and became even more violent
socialism,not_removed,the number of people killed in syria is heavily disputed its the total number of deaths by all factions and everybody inflates their casualties to make the other guy look bad unfortunately its a warzone out there so everybody whos sane enough to count casualties in a reliable way left in well have to determine afterwards
socialism,not_removed,this is incoherent
socialism,not_removed,parallel state
socialism,not_removed,wasnt he a pcc lawyer or something like this
socialism,not_removed,the pcc name of the parallel state is a giant criminal organization who rules the city parts ignored by the government they actually have their own justice and part of the public transport of the city is funded by them they grant the protection that government doesnt but they are not good people or angels they exploit people just like the government do
socialism,not_removed,did somebody say dual power
socialism,not_removed,a power issue with the degree of administrativepolitic autonomy public institutions hold or duality of functions
socialism,not_removed,another good example is pkk in northern kurdistan nvm it is state within a state difference is whether if state benefits from parallel state or vice versa an organization that acts as an autonomous state within the borders of another legitimate state think as de jure de facto difference
socialism,not_removed,yes yes he was
socialism,not_removed,exploit not explore
socialism,not_removed,are there ever standoffs between rival police forcessecurity patrols
socialism,not_removed,thanks in portuguese we use the same word ive done a dumb association
socialism,not_removed,not so much in são paulo which is controled by a single faction pcc that is deeply ingrained into the institutional politics in rio on the other hand main factions cv tcp and ada fight for territories and there are frequent conflicts between them the state also applied the upp policy httpsenwikipediaorgwikipacifyingpoliceunit that dislodged most of the gangs out of their original territories and helped to secure a temporary peaceful time on the state but now that the dust has setted things are getting even worse than before the city of rio de janeiro and its surrounding towns are turning more and more into a guns and drugsfueled clusterfuck edit theres also the fact that pcc and cv had a long time truce that was recently broken so now theyre also disputing territories all over the country shits gonna get even worse from now on
socialism,not_removed,off topic i was an english teacher and even after a year i still made that mistake from time to time its almost automatic hahaha
socialism,not_removed,til i wonder if the synonym happened before colonialism or after that period explore exploit
socialism,not_removed,i like votepledging models everyone is allowed to attend all policy sessions but for things on a large scale that cant work so you pledge your vote to someone else this action is obviously instantly recallable and with a delay between voting and passing so you dont get the problem where someone amasses a lot of votes and does something stupid with them such as not show up to a key vote advantages fast no need for elections and also no need for referendumsexcept in special cases scalable it can work on the highest levels of government just as well as it works on the factory floor fair one person one vote disadvantages possible regression to republicstyle government possibility for formation of personality cults
socialism,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiconsensusdecisionmaking as much as possible decisions made small and local as much as possible
socialism,not_removed,direct democracy and consensus until the time when democracy and government itself becomes unnecessary and obsolete
socialism,not_removed,mixed most important decisions on how society functions should be made at an individual level by councils made up of representatives that can elected and recalled at any time its important that people should be able to go to the meetings of the councils and participate in deliberationshave their voices heard on a regional national level a devolved state will be made up of a representative elected by each council that participates in parliament the regional and national states will have the responsibility of coordinating the building of large infrastructure administering healthcare and other important services
socialism,not_removed,for starters direct delegative democracy httpsenwikipediaorgwikidelegativedemocracy direct delegative democracy is the form of democracy id like to see socialists experiment with as they build their own organizations and ultimately dual power popular referendum and immediate recall eg the features socialists have traditionally praised about the paris commune are pretty much built into the mechanics of the system like the paris commune working government administrators should receive no more than a skilled laborers salary ultimately however the way any particular communitygroupenterprise engages in collective decisionmaking will be up to them as long as rights to freedom of speech and association which are necessary for democracy to function are being respected as far as politics and federal representation go if there are parties there should be many parties as opposed to one or two edit i suspect kingradical and i are pretty much talking about the same thing
socialism,not_removed,i think any sort of democracy always reproduces a competition for beeing the bigger group to force the smaller to abide by its will it doesnt give an incentive to find a compromise to actually find a middleground everyone can live with cooperation on a voluntary basis sounds more reasonable to me
socialism,not_removed,there are a lot of facets outside of this too what exactly would they vote on how frequently would things be voted on would they be in person only or do you believe in internet voting would some sort of legislative branch come up with the details for what people are voting on would their be multiple choices rather than yesno and if so would you support some sort of ranked or preference voting democratic systems are complex
socialism,not_removed,no democracy is not defined as majority rule how can voluntary cooperation work if you have no idea the effect on others
socialism,not_removed,hey man im not designing a government here
socialism,not_removed,no because the attitude of the socialist is global empathy for everyone
socialism,not_removed,no democracy is not defined as majority rule then we might be talking about different things every definition of democracy i know has either a direct majority descion or beeing the biggest group by proxy with a representative for the biggest group which results in the same how can voluntary cooperation work if you have no idea the effect on others why wouldnt you have an idea on the effect on others its not about static local groups but everyone effected by a descion gets involved
socialism,not_removed,i am infact talking about consensus
socialism,not_removed,ha no problem comrade i was mostly pointing out other things to consider is all
socialism,not_removed,well if nobody has to actually make decisions with anybody else i feel like that attitude would erode fast
socialism,not_removed,democracy is defined as rule by the people dont let the current norms limit the word for you i would expect socialists to use consensus democracy its not about static local groups but everyone effected by a descion gets involved as soon as you get people together to discuss and make decisions you have a democracy
socialism,not_removed,what difference does it make if your fellow worker lives right next door or halfway around the world thats the attitude that would arise after the revolution or evolution imo
socialism,not_removed,i dont understand your implication what makes you think nobody has to actually make decisions with anybody else
socialism,not_removed,semantics you dont find it often that people equal democracy with consensus and i havent heard it before myself normaly when people mean your consensus democracy they simply name it consensus this just leads to people talking in circles if you try to redefine already used terms this discussion is the perfect example we both wasted time to formulate these posts without making actual progress we just got around an unnecessary language barrier you wont be able to simply redefine democracy and why would you spend time on such an senseless task just because people already like the sound of democracy
socialism,not_removed,well if every decision is small and local that encourages thinking more internally for instance if the national government had no influence on my life i would completely ignore it along with that i ignore how things are going in maine because it similarly doesnt affect me
socialism,not_removed,consensus is a type of democracy capitalists demand a representative democracy they can buy and turn into a plutocracy which they have done im still hopeful you can be educated and im sure others have been
socialism,not_removed,thats only if you lack empathy for your fellow workers no matter where they are i dont think thats a socialist
socialism,not_removed,consensus is a type of democracy north korea also calls itself the democratic peoples republic of korea its meaningless why would you bother on how to call it wouldnt the time be better spend to convince people of the actual values you aim for and which you connect with the term instead of convincing them that yours is the one true heir of the democracy term its just extremly easy to become coopted when you rally around an interpretable term instead of an actual programm and i dont see any benefit except leeching on the general positive image people already associate with the term
socialism,not_removed,so your idea relies on people being truly devoted to socialism for it to work i dont think its safe to rely on that especially if were talking longer than a few generations
socialism,not_removed,one true heir of the democracy term never said that never consensus is one type of democracy and i dont see any benefit except leeching on the general positive image people already associate with the term democracy rule by the people is a good thing why let the oppressors coopt it do you accept their definition of socialism or communism
socialism,not_removed,no it relies on people pulling off the yoke of capitalism and becoming free to be human and humane again
socialism,not_removed,humans are a mish mash of different inclinations and most people arent capable of thinking particularly well outside their bubble of influence for that matter im actually inclined to believe this might be better than the contrary as there are enough people that prefer personal or small scale commune autonomy over being dictated by ones neighbor commune or a central authority its less pressuring or stressful and people are good at making decisions for themselves or their own communities if you trust them to do so
socialism,not_removed,only made it about seconds in cringed out
socialism,not_removed,holy crap that thing is sick comrade
socialism,not_removed,considering sniper rifles as part of a national armys weapons the mosin–nagant is the longest continuously serving rifle in history at more than years just wow that is impressive but serious use today can only be as a sniper rifle its too slow and limited against automatic weapons
socialism,not_removed,thats class i sort of wish guns were more legal in the uk not like in america where you dont even get idd in some states but still
socialism,not_removed,mosinnagants do tend to load slowly not just because they are round bolt actions but because the stripper clips tend to stick when loading i find it quicker just to load round by round instead of using a stripper in practiced hands though they are not to be fucked with is no slouch
socialism,not_removed,ive had a few they are great fun youre lucky to have gotten an accurate one my was not what you would call accurate
socialism,not_removed,the millennials i talk to have no interest in socialsim they just want capitalism to not suck so much well of them anyway or so seem cool with the ideals of socialism
socialism,not_removed,could the opportunity for revolution be imminent i mean the middle class is disappearing unemployment and debt is going up and the people are more open to socialism will we finally see true socialism and not scandinavian social democracy
socialism,not_removed,its a step though its easier to radicalize socdems than centrist liberals the older crowd is moving right while the youth is moving left the future is sort of promising i think
socialism,not_removed,if we get another big economic crisis i could see something happening
socialism,not_removed,for sure in fact i find far more reception to socialism than i ever have over the last years i can remember talking about wealth inequality and socialism for a college presentation in was hilarious how much people were upset by it now i see people nodding their heads in agreement
socialism,not_removed,yeah same its not a bad time to be a leftist im excited for the future for sure
socialism,not_removed,thank you for this
socialism,not_removed,the irony in this would be hilarious if it didnt cost so many thousands of people their lives fucking ridiculous
socialism,not_removed,breast cancer is so fucking shitty not just because its a shitty disease because it absolutely is but also because its used as this fucking shield for so much bullshit its okay to not stop people from beating their girlfriends and wives because occasionally you make people wear pink its okay to make millions by fooling people into believing theyre helping people fight cancer as long as you do it with cute slogans and pink and apparently its okay to kill people as long as you profess sympathy with some people dying from the same thing fuck pink fuck breast cancer and fuck this awareness nonsense we know about breast cancer now
socialism,not_removed,this is the best tldr i could make reduced by im a bot imagine all the awareness that will rise in the contrails of these two pink fighter jets brought to you in honor of breast cancer awareness month by the us navy and the israeli air force while the world increases its efforts to spread awareness about cancer and celebrate new ways to treat it cancer patients in gaza have complained about the restrictions placed by israel on their treatment spokeswoman for the patients nawal salloum stated in a news conference held on monday that the hospitals in gaza are not prepared for the treatment of cancer conditions and lack medical appliances including those used for radiation therapy and breast cancer detection version tldrs so far pms and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome top keywords

socialism,not_removed,no hes just insane like all white mass killers not a by products of white supremacy s
socialism,not_removed,the very first reports quoted a policeman who wanted ro anonymous i think saying the suspect had a quebec name this typicality means a french name its not likely that anybody would say that about el khadir not that that says doodle about anybodys religion just that names were out there early on
socialism,not_removed,media gonna media
socialism,not_removed,fox news claimed that witnesses said at least one gunman shouted allahu akbar remember hearing this exact same thing watching last night italian public news program every eu nation has a bbc like public service
socialism,not_removed,i felt so upset last night to me the reaction was as revealing as the actual killing the instant reaction from many on the right was not one of compassion or concern for the injured but immediate opportunism trying desperately to create a narrative that this was muslims killing each other in an attempt to absolve themselves of guilt about what their kind of prejudices can lead to and to compound this trumps press secretary exploited this attack to justify their deplorable travel ban i was heartened to see the amount of solidarity shown towards the victims and despite my issues with trudeaus government i commend him for explicitly denouncing the attack as terrorism and stating his solidarity with the canadian muslim community
socialism,not_removed,theyre only responsible for their crimes if it fits our agenda fascistsandneoconsirl
socialism,not_removed,dont forget the number of countries who refused jewish refugees in the because we cant let you in because we dont have any antisemitism and we are afraid that if you come it will stoke antisemitism
socialism,not_removed,well is anyone genuinely shocked trumps right hand man is a saint of the white supremacists the administration is truly a blight on history
socialism,not_removed,i just want him to be asked at the next press conference and trump too about that i want to know what they have to say about that action
socialism,not_removed,yes trudeaus government has many many flaws but the denunciation of the acts as terrorism and the standing in solidarity with his countries muslim community was quite heartening the reaction here in the states quite the opposite but not surprising
socialism,not_removed,well put
socialism,not_removed,some indicator of sarcasm might be important here since that strain of thought is all too common
socialism,not_removed,trudeau provided a needed opposite to the rhetoric leaving the whitehouse
socialism,not_removed,im impressed that he called it terrorism right off the bat most rightwing attacks in the west usually have government officials dodging the word terrorism
socialism,not_removed,id include a s if this were rpolitics but here it isnt needed
socialism,not_removed,he has the worlds easiest job right about now wake up in the morning make no policy changes release a few liberal platitudes and sound bites dont say anything racist during the day and go to bed a paragon of virtue in the eyes of the world media
socialism,not_removed,is this the first such incident in canada since trudeau was elected i think it was canada has a long history of white christians perpetrating terror its about time its called what it is
socialism,not_removed,every world leader is a great leader when compared to trump
socialism,not_removed,bah gawd thats dutertes music
socialism,not_removed,use the megathread please
socialism,not_removed,what i wonder is how these political scientists account for the emergence of authoritarianism in the subject so to speak its al very httpsenwikipediaorgwikitheauthoritarianpersonality for older comrades im sure nonetheless the shroud of hate that is engulfing us has its own characteristics its interesting to note the elemental marxist platitude that it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence but their social existence that determines their consciousness is revealing in its disclosure of the effects of corporatebourgeois institutions on the consciousness of the american people
socialism,not_removed,post it in the
socialism,not_removed,we have to vote for hillary clinton i told her there was a friendliness in my voice but there was also a smugness of course there was a smugness in your voice
socialism,not_removed,while the disconnect is obvious and an important issue to overcome the implications made in the rest of the piece will only serve to perpetuate barriers liberals face in moving leftward thats precisely why it was so nauseating
socialism,not_removed,ucybrosis has been posting this in a thread im following in rscifi about a star trek future and i dont know where they got their numbers from but its a place to start at least also the total at the bottom includes some famine deaths and other things so you might have to do some subtraction to get deaths from just imperialism per se edit apparently this isnt only the us but hey death toll of capitalism in general is close enough right second boer war japanese massacre of singapore burmasiam railroad construction japanese germ warfare in china rebelling shia killed by saddam us bombing of yugoslavia us bombing iraq water supply us civil war iraqiran war us sanctions on iraq us backed suharto irish potato famine japanese democides famine of bengal famine of famine in british india us intervention in the congo hurricane katrina indonesian anticom purge stateless capitalist somalia industrial revolution usa us war vs philippine palestinians killed by israel guatemala nanking massacre iraq selling gas to saddam iraq desert storm invasion of the philippines afghanistan iraq south african apartheid nazi holocaust us aggression on latin america japanese imperialism vietnam war including cambodia laos korean war british occupation of india great depression america alone world war one world war two native american genocide capitalist policy in india african slave trade us backed murder of tamils spanishamerican war spanish civil war union carbide bophal disaster massacre of paris commune first indochina belgian congo colonization french madagascar nigerian civil war rwandan genocide us made famine bangladesh children died fr hunger children killed by hunger since children killed by hunger during the cigarette related deaths worldwide total killed by capitalism
socialism,not_removed,dont know but im anxiously awaiting the results of this thread i would imagine a few hundred million
socialism,not_removed,le livre noir du capitalisme put the death toll at about million httpsfrwikipediaorgwikilelivrenoirducapitalismeoldformattrue since the book isnt very well known in anglophone areas
socialism,not_removed,its probably over million if you count us support for dictatorships and terrorists in bangladesh and indonesia alone the total deaths attributed to usbacked regimes may be as high as million
socialism,not_removed,calculates all of the deaths or at least the possible to be attributed to capitalism capitalism is responsible for it separates them out by eventcause it is also very wellsourced
socialism,not_removed,not the exact thing you asked for but you are bound to find some overlapping numbers in
socialism,not_removed,you would have to count all deaths from poverty poor healthcare most depression deaths etc on a few continents now judge which ones are from imperialism and which are not then the wars revolutions a lot
socialism,not_removed,if you count all foreign wars with the us as a primary aggresor occupations proxy wars and supported regimesgenocides probably pushing million warning i did no research whatsoever
socialism,not_removed,yikes thats kinda dystopic
socialism,not_removed,you can add leopolds congo free state to that between and leopold and his police force killed half of congos million people all in the name of selling shit but jesus fucking christ that is absolutely horrific
socialism,not_removed,million on wwi i thought the number was something between million
socialism,not_removed,i think you probably missed out a lot of famines just in the period from the imposition of british free trade on india and china caused about million people to die in famines mike davis late victorian holocausts pp
socialism,not_removed,ty
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,a lot of small things like making cheaper and less safe breaks in cars or whatever
socialism,not_removed,that might be from wars but what about the atrocious public health stuff of which capitalism is the main contributor add in heart disease and cancer from demerit goods cancer from capitalist pollution that number goes way up also public health disasters and environmentally caused crises too
socialism,not_removed,no offense but some of this stuff is really a stretch the native american genocide could be cited for mostly imperialism but capitalism was barely developed at the time and society was largely feudal this pretty much a list of bad things done by noncommunist and you included the fascists who are very evil but still not capitalist
socialism,not_removed,native american genocide itd be better if this could be broken down into the various tribes the usa explicitly ethnically cleansed through systematic murder eg the iroquois cherokee seminoles cree
socialism,not_removed,im totally willing to believe that people died during the great depression but id love to see a citation on that million figure that would be nearly dead out of every people
socialism,not_removed,but in the americas at least of the native americans died due to small pox and other diseases killed is still a high number though considering thats and i think you could almost halve the casualties in according to the most agreed upon figures i think we are doing our cause a disservice by being historically inaccurate although i do agree with your overall argument against imperialism and capitalism
socialism,not_removed,yeah i dont know how trustworthy the numbers are like i said i didnt make this list and i dont know what sources ucybrosis used but i thought the list of atrocities at least was worthy of sharing so people who were more interested in the task could go and check the numbers
socialism,not_removed,usually the millions of people in india asia and africa that died of starvation are left out of the casualty count
socialism,not_removed,ｃａｐｉｔａｌｉｓｍ －ｌｉｔｅｒａｌｌｙ －－ｋｉｌｌｓ．－－
socialism,not_removed,i absolutely insist on protecting private property we must encourage private initiative adolf hitler
socialism,not_removed,fascists very much do serve the interests of capital if unknowingly fascistic economies have all the characteristics of capitalist economies as well wage labor private control of the means of production capital accumulation etc
socialism,not_removed,fascism is a capitalist ideology no matter how much fascists claim its a third way
socialism,not_removed,i accept and proudly display your dip label
socialism,not_removed,but those event are in any way related to the first great war or not sorry im ignorant regarding these events
socialism,not_removed,in many cases small pox was spread intentionally this is simply not true do you have any sources
socialism,not_removed,my bad i mustve mixed the death toll in the russian civil war with that of i didnt know about the diseases being spread intentionally though ill have to look more into that my apologies comrade for not doing my homework
socialism,not_removed,yes these people were starved out because all of the food was going to feed allied and russian soldiers
socialism,not_removed,many cases being only fort trent small pox were already a huge problem for the native americans before fort trent
socialism,not_removed,i think your analysis is pretty excellent and obviously you may be the only person on youtube doing this sort of analysis id absolutely love to see more the only criticism i have is that your voice and the sound effects of the game are in conflict and it was difficult to hear what you were saying at times
socialism,not_removed,thank you very much i hope to do another video soon someone else said that as well about the audio mix i think youre right i wanted to compromise so you could hear both but i guess my vo is more important to hear in the future ill cut the video up more so that if theres something in the game thats important ill be silent and turn it up
socialism,not_removed,but i guess my vo is more important to hear its some topgrade analysis of course your voice is more important to hear comrade
socialism,not_removed,this one is good because they show off their bigotry while also getting fundamental poststructuralist philosophy incorrect reality isnt subjective metanarratives that doesnt even make sense the suspicion of metanarratives is that they attempt to universalize one single mode of acquiring knowledge while not really being equipped to do so hence the attempt to localize narratives its like they just started throwing around postmodern buzzwords to imply that anyone who objects to the abjection of transpeople has nothing but jargon to substantiate their claim i dont even know what theyre saying in that but whoever runs that page is a fucking dork
socialism,not_removed,back at it again
socialism,not_removed,i realize the malicious nature of this meme and the oppressive nature of the argument it makes so please know that i am not making this request with malicious intent can somebody please offer me a thorough scientific rebuttal to this and help me understand the nature of transgenderism and gender identity i really really do not understand this stuff and the internet so far has been a terrible resource of contradicting information
socialism,not_removed,im not sure what action could be taken to stop this but is there any way to get this page shutdown all or most of us here understand quite well that this has nothing to do with marxism but this is a crucial time and if even a few people are turned away from socialism or marxism because of this then it needs to be stopped
socialism,not_removed,who are these people and why are they doing this
socialism,not_removed,theres so much crap in there like conflating sex and reproduction even though sex has a lot of biological functions and often isnt reproductive the idea that reproduction is between two people is obviously largely true but due to donor mitochondria some babies technically have three parents although obviously not naturally it doesnt follow that just because there are two people involved in reproduction that there are only two sexes because if there were more sexes they would only reproduce with one person at a time finally there are actually three sexes male female and intersex people although intersex is an umbrella term
socialism,not_removed,the latest copy of nat geo explains it pretty well basically if your fellow human wants to be treated a certain way because it causes them distress otherwise and all you have to do is watch what you say then its common decency and respect to accommodate them and when i say distress i mean serious mental anguish to the point of suicide trans people have extremely high suicide rates you dont really have to judge or understand their side of things to be respectful
socialism,not_removed,think of it like hair you like people with a certain hair color you have a certain hair color it doesnt have to match up you can dye your hair if you want you wouldnt call a blonde a brunette ye
socialism,not_removed,shut it down how on what grounds they arent breaking any rules or laws
socialism,not_removed,of course i already stand in solidarity with the trans struggle simply knowing that they are an oppressed group and while i dont need to understand their side of things to do that i still want to
socialism,not_removed,because theyre shitty why do i give a shit about some dweebs and their terrible tankie meme page id shut them down in a heartbeat if i knew how
socialism,not_removed,my point is that you cant just shut them down we dont own facebook we cant just have them shutdown because we dont like their memes
socialism,not_removed,hi there im not a socialist at all but i lurk here i have a serious question to all of you what you suggest that the world have done in the case of yugoslavia i mean the serbs were committing acts of genocide in bosnia and mass ethnic cleansing in kosovo should everyone have just sat and watched as thousands were killed and hundreds of thousands of albanians and bosniaks had to flee their homes for fear of being killed individual acts in the bombing campaign against yugoslavia was wrong as was western support for some of the atrocities in operation storm where serbs were ethnically cleansed from croatia but was the concept of intervention to stop a genocide wrong
socialism,not_removed,keep in mind that everyone and the world are not welldefined subjects who could do anything much less intervene there is no army of the world neither an airforce of everyone there is imperialist powers for which declarations of intent say stop the genocide protect the people from gadaffi find wmds seldom match the actual intentions therefore when one says let us intervene in a they should be ready to explain not how their ideal form of intervention would be useful and necessary but how the actual intervention by such powers would solve problems and why they would be interested in solving them
socialism,not_removed,httpjohnpilgercomarticlesdontforgetyugoslavia
socialism,not_removed,what does that actually mean though yes america and britain had the firepower should they have sat around and did nothing when srbrenica happened
socialism,not_removed,it actually means that the actors of international relations say the british or the american state are seldom moved by pure altruism therefore when we urge them to do something or to protect the innocent we misunderstand their nature and conversely when they claim to do something out of the goodness of their heart we should be suspicious btw srbrenica did happen so i am not sure what is your point
socialism,not_removed,you should read more about america and britain you are banging intervention over everyones heads as if nothing ever goes wrong in most cases the people are worse off when an imperialist country intervenes and did you even watch the video
socialism,not_removed,so should there have been an intervention or not yes or no
socialism,not_removed,the point i am trying to make is that posing this question is a sign of misundersanding the situation
socialism,not_removed,so you have no actual answer was it right to stop the atrocities in the balkans with military force yes or no
socialism,not_removed,you asked a question i gave you my view on it if you do not wish to engage you are free to but repeating the question eleven times is not very productive
socialism,not_removed,but you didnt actually answer it you gave a convoluted word salad non answer because youre in a pickle if you say yes then youre supporting something america did and you cant do that if you say no youre saying that you condone genocide christ i feel like if hitler hadnt attacked the soviets you would be the type to scream stand with germany against british imperialism or something
socialism,not_removed,pointing that a question is based on false assumptions and therefore it has no sensible answer is exactly answering the question if you would have prefered another answer you are free to engage with the points i made and disprove them if you do not however then making progressively more outrageous claims about me is of little use
socialism,not_removed,the only question i asked is if intervention was justified or not lets put it in another scenario lets saybulgaria started killing its muslim minority should the ukusfrance intervene to stop genocide
socialism,not_removed,this is not another scenario it is the exact same scenario this time framed as an imaginary conflict rather than a real one again the same answer applies
socialism,not_removed,implying the us uk and france prevent genocide wow
socialism,not_removed,so the answer is no genocide shouldnt be stopped
socialism,not_removed,thats pretty much exactly what happened in yugoslavia and thats what shouldve happened in rwanda youd let people get slaughtered because you cant be seen to agree with america
socialism,not_removed,the answer is that this is a pointless question designed to portray imperialist powers as protectors of the innocent and whoever poses it has a naive understanding of international politics
socialism,not_removed,again there you go implying america are the good guys even worse is your implication that somehow socialist countries cant be seen to agree with america thats just so false i dont even know where to begin pick up a book and hopefully over time you will realize that socialist countries supplied many struggling african nations burkina faso comes to mind immediately with aid when countries like france and the us only treated them as satellite puppet states your concern is faux moralizing and its disgusting anyone who knows history can see right through this apologia for imperialism and colonialism nevermind the fact that rwanda is a great example of us inaction wwii is a another good example in general us foreign policy has never been about freedom and democracy read more and you will find this whole but what would you do question is fundamentally flawed as it implies the us is solving the crises in these countries it isnt it never has and never will it has nothing to do with freedom and democracy again did you even watch the video are you just here to spew bourgeois propaganda
socialism,not_removed,so you dont think that genocides should be stopped nice real defenders of the innocent you people are
socialism,not_removed,rwanda was a great example of us inaction thats why bosnia and kosovo were pushed so adamantly to atone for the sin of staying out of it american foreign policy has lots to criticize and there are always motives that arent humanitarian but that doesnt take away from stopping genocides americas biggest crime in wwii is selling the country of my parents to the soviets which perpetrated horrors on par with the nazis upon the polish nation
socialism,not_removed,they might teach this technique in your rhetoric club but it is not usually deployed in conversation among real people
socialism,not_removed,implying the soviets were literally hitler what the fuck
socialism,not_removed,literal non logic
socialism,not_removed,hitler and stalin jointly invaded poland see molotov ribbentrop pact and hitler killed of polands population of ethnic poles and of polands jews stalin killed almost million poles deported almost million poles to siberia where of them died ethnically cleansed over million poles from their ancestral homelands in what is now ukraine and belarus completely liquified polands cultural and social institutions refused to send aid to the warsaw uprising because he wanted to keep the nazis there until the red army could get their and poland could fall into the soviet sphere expressly allowed red army soldiers to rape their way through poland and then set up a puppet state thats just in the it would take a whole other post to talk about the half century of occupation by the soviets so yes in my personal opinion the soviet treatment of my ancestors is about equal to the nazi treatment ask anyone in formerly soviet occupied eastern europe that isnt a nostalgic russian nationalist and theyll give you a similar answer
socialism,not_removed,capitalists always try to use the excuse that its only rational to maximize profits especially in the wake of increasing costs by increasing revenues but that doesnt make you blameless in having committed that action especially if the ceo is reaping a sizeable benefit you arent inculpable for your actions just because theyre economically rational
socialism,not_removed,accepts western aid orders nato strikes o arab civs allows usaf and idf vets in their rank many who sport infidel clothing and support trump denial intensifies
socialism,not_removed,am i becoming a socialist you always were you just didnt realise it is socialism something that would address and fight those concerns that i have yes that feeling youre feeling is called alienation although not always voiced as much as it should be the fight against alienation is one of the biggest aspects of socialism this is a quote that sums the whole thing up for me socialism now if it means anything means this to seek the end of the boredom of struggle the end of the boredom of poverty the end of the need to battle property to have food shelter and the ability to exist it means the end of the boredom of work the end of the struggle against work the end of the day in the field or the factory or the dullness of the call centre the end of the boredom of struggle against those who would prevent what we chose to be what we chose to do and who we chose to love while we might see the best of what we are in the struggle now we can only imagine the best of what we might become without this weight upon us without this weight of violence without the boredom of struggle
socialism,not_removed,if you watch they live this reminds me of you youre kinda peaking through the veil that bourgeois society builds to hide how it operates
socialism,not_removed,id say youre on the path to becoming a socialist if you understand that the existing economic system is what constrains your ability to pursue your genuine interests what in marxian terminology is called alienation however being a marxist and being critical of capitalism does not by itself make one a socialist to be a socialist one has to advocate for social ownership of the means of producing wealth as the solution to the structural issues of capitalism i have always liked the few ideas of socialism that i knew but recently this epiphany really has me thinking about it am i on the right track is socialism something that would address and fight those concerns that i have socialism certainly provides solutions to your particular concerns by eliminating the distinction between workers and owners every individual becomes a partowner of the means of production and thus a recipient of the net social product this reduces dependency on employers and the need to be subservient and conformist especially if each individual receives an unconditional social dividend payment from the proceeds of publiclyowned enterprises andor free public goods the second and what i would argue more important way socialism addresses your concerns about alienation is by enabling a reduction of the length of the standard workday to accommodate advances in work automation while you would still have to work in a socialist society work would no longer dominate and define your life unless it happens to be a field you are genuinely passionate about and choose to dedicate much time and energy toward and you would have large amounts of time and energy to pursue your own genuine creative and leisure interests to a marxian socialist the expansion of this sphere of activity and reduction of the sphere of compulsory work is the very definition of freedom
socialism,not_removed,yeah socialism would absolutely address those concerns capitalism is failing in every possible measure and we can build something so much better but capitalism is not going to go away on its own if this is something important to you or something that you want to learn more about you should seriously think about getting involved in a socialist organisation that operates in your area
socialism,not_removed,ill say that ive definitely observed in my school a lot of really bright people working towards degrees in areas that they arent super enthused about especially stem computer science being q big one because of the potential potential earnings and many of them are really unhappy mostly because capitalism inherently structures a society that conflates personal value with economic productivity rather and material wealth rather than creativity contribution to humanity or happiness i dont know how much or little this applies to you but yeah it sounds like you might be a socialist
socialism,not_removed,socialism and science arent independent nor are science and arts its possible to get a science degree and get involved in arts later on though that is a depressingly pragmatic view of it many see socialism as a way of letting people do what they want though that rarely addresses how to handle imbalances in labour supply and demand as socialists eat and shit like everyone else so there would be some limits to being able to do whatever you wanted even in ideal socialism there are of course many solutions there such as compensation for such work though that is moving into pseudocapitlism
socialism,not_removed,you have the freedom to work a dead end job for the rest of your life great
socialism,not_removed,from whom is this quote i like it
socialism,not_removed,such a great movie love everything carpenter has done although i acknowledge the racism and chinoiserie of big trouble in little china but they live is great for illustrating so many points about society and ideology to the lay person
socialism,not_removed,lol
socialism,not_removed,because theyre shackled by the economic chains that capitalism places on us at birth they see that systematic change is the only thing that could allow them to pursue their actual passion with no threat of not being able to eat or have a bed to sleep in at night theyre definitely becoming class consciousness and are starting to see the trap that capitalism places on us they might not be a socialist but i wouldnt have any qualms considering them an anticapitalist or skeptic of capitalism which is what i was before i fully embraced the idea that socialism while maybe not perfect is a better and more equitable system than what we currently have
socialism,not_removed,the only information i have for it is its called form of life collective what is to be won ive been trying to find more by the authors for a while because i love the writing style but ive come up short
socialism,not_removed,i agree i know bgilt is meant to make fun against hollywood being racist but still it falls in to it
socialism,not_removed,i think one of the biggest issues with capitalism is that it lets people create hundreds of brands and come up of with ideas for products at such a fast rate that it no longer lets younger generations innovate and create anything new all of the ideas have already been taken every logo every food chain or every smart phone app has been created which slims down peoples chances of standing out and coming up with something unique novelty gets lost in capitalism the capitalist zeitgeist is already full
socialism,not_removed,honestly theyre scaring us too right i feel like this effect is being sort of canceled out plenty of radical leftists or even just racial minorities lgbt people women etc regardless of politics feel threatened and unsafe because of the altright and whatever other white supremacists maybe even more than rightists feel threatened by us think about it the media is on their side and they have much bigger numbers than we do the terrorists we know as the police force shoot an unarmed black person to death it is justice they deserved it richard spencer is punched antifa are the real fascists
socialism,not_removed,i am afraid i have to disagree when i have read online forums with neonazis they usually want antifa to show up the reason they give is that it puts the neonazis in a positive and sympathetic light whereas antifascists are considered unruly uncivilized and dangerous so in their view the presence of antifascists at neonazi demonstrations serve their purposes better than it serves the antifascists that the nazis are correct in their analysis is also my own experience most often when i debate with nonsocialists it is leftwing violence that they end up criticizing they might agree that it is a fine ideal to support economic democracy and other socialist ideals but even then it usually falters because of the actions of antifascists whom they feel that they cannot trust with social change and i am inclined to agree if antifascists cannot see how rhetorically damaging their activities are that violent antifascism does more damage than not in the long run because of bad social relations how can they be entrusted with securing human ends in the case of a revolution we need to be pragmatic and consider what consequences our actions have rather than just acting out of firm and uncompromising principles or else we will never achieve our goals
socialism,not_removed,httpimgurcomaeumzz
socialism,not_removed,so you people advocate violence against people whos views differ from yours surprising edit i know this sub is supposed to be a safe space and echochamber for the socialist ideology but i honestly dont understand the cognitive dissonance between opposing oppression and then directly advocating for the same oppressive tactics to be used against people who happen to have a different opinion
socialism,not_removed,i can understand a minority being afraid hell i would be too but those of us born with the right skin colour or whatever shouldnt be call me naive but i feel like loudly and advocating for what is right when your cause is just shouldnt make you afraid it should fill you with courage the moment you are afraid is when the fascists and reactionaries win
socialism,not_removed,try black panther style organization
socialism,not_removed,most often when i debate with nonsocialists it is leftwing violence that they end up criticizing you do point out that every day life under capitalism is violent too right violent in the sense that it slaughters tens of thousands of kids a day not violent in the sense that a piece of glass might get broken
socialism,not_removed,there is no such thing as non violent antifascism if you wont fight fascists you are submitting to them nonviolent means will serve no purpose whatsoever to stop their actions ideally neonazis should justifiably fear for their lives should their fascism be made public fascism must be stopped by any means necessary and allowing their cancer to act and grow is as bad as supporting their wretched views to condemn those who are out there risking themselves to fight this grotesque evil is liberal ideology better to try and fail to stop evil than to stand back and hope your think pieces and strikes make a difference they wont these are immaterial concepts a dead nazi cant hurt anyone a living one can and will no further questions need to be asked
socialism,not_removed,i recently had an open forum among my liberal friends and the leftist violence they were worried about is the kind associated with stalin and mao ie state violence not antifa this is in the bay area so berkeley is personal to them
socialism,not_removed,whats your recommendation instead
socialism,not_removed,but if nobody is getting punched how can it be violence s
socialism,not_removed,yes i do but it is an important aspect of rhetorics that violence and anger is extremely poor at converting people violence and anger also creates a very bad first impression that is difficult to sever my experience is that it takes extra effort to move past these presumptions when i try to convince people of socialism so it happens that antifa is a major bump in the road in this regard
socialism,not_removed,fascism must be stopped by any means necessary and allowing their cancer to act and grow is as bad as supporting their wretched views the issue here is that a moderate approach is possibly a better and necessary means in the long term at least if you take into account how violence reduces the support of the general population this is important because socialism depends on the support of people nazis might introduce a new regime by using authoritarian measures but this is not an option for socialists because socialism is inherently democratic therefore we need to take the route which soundly and pragmatically convinces most people not today not tomorrow but in the long haul it is important to be not be shortsighted in this regard for using violence is often just that impatience and unawareness of how it affects public relations to condemn those who are out there risking themselves to fight this grotesque evil is liberal ideology better to try and fail to stop evil than to stand back and hope your think pieces and strikes make a difference but i am actively trying to stop them words and ideals are powerful fists and violence on the other hand damages the image of socialists and ruins our prospects using violence is also the easy alternative for all it requires are reflexes muscles and anger whereas communication requires people skills intelligence and humility the question is what it means for us to choose violence before communication because i am fairly certain that it is a contortion of our sound ethical minds to use a cliché which i think this subreddit is too quick to dismiss it does bring us down to a level closer to the nazis if not all the way but even if my last sentence above is not true it is still how people look at us when we use violence for violence against the nazis they wonder why we are not willing to use more constructive efforts to move our cause forward this public impression is itself a reason to be cautious publicity should mean everything for socialists at the current stage where our influence is minimal this is not to say that we should not use violence against fascists but the issue is that we should use it sparingly and when it actually serves a goal right now it does not a dead nazi cant hurt anyone yes a dead nazi might not hurt anyone but martyrdom is a powerful concept that just creates even more of them here in sweden we see a rise of nationalists and nazis my impression is that they feed on feeling as if they are victims they certainly use the violence used against them as propaganda in this sense it is the nazis not us socialists nor anybody else who benefit from the violence against them
socialism,not_removed,the overthrow of capitalism by the proletariat
socialism,not_removed,sorry but i dont understand your point can you clarify assuming a person is a convicted murderer theyd be in jail already offending someone is not a crime however physically assaulting someone because they happen to have a make america great again hat on is a crime and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law
socialism,not_removed,the issue here is that a moderate approach is possibly a better and necessary means in the long term at least if you take into account how violence reduces the support of the general population this is important because socialism depends on the support of people not at all the guy with the bigger gun decides how things go if we are that guy bam boom we have socialism nazis might introduce a new regime by using authoritarian measures but this is not an option for socialists because socialism is inherently democratic last i check seizing the means and dismantling a state doesnt take a council to do we can worry about democracy when the united states government is broken and destroyed therefore we need to take the route which soundly and pragmatically convinces most people not today not tomorrow but in the long haul it is important to be not be shortsighted in this regard for using violence is often just that impatience and unawareness of how it affects public relations support is only relevant if you need more people to win a revolution we need to be pragmatic yes we should be actively antagonizing and hindering the capitalist effort in the only way that makes significant difference violent resistance to their evil laws all we need to do is win public support etc etc is second to deposing the military and silencing the rise of fascism but i am actively trying to stop them words and ideals are powerful fists and violence on the other hand damages the image of socialists and ruins our prospects using violence is also the easy alternative for all it requires are reflexes muscles and anger whereas communication requires people skills intelligence and humility the question is what it means for us to choose violence before communication because i am fairly certain that it is a contortion of our sound ethical minds to use a cliché which i think this subreddit is too quick to dismiss it does bring us down to a level closer to the nazis if not all the way how privileged you must be i bet you arent afraid to walk from one street to another with the fear some redneck asshole will rape andor kill you i bet youve never been hungry sitting in your armchair with your thumb up your ass and voting for bernie sanders is completely meaningless changes absolutely nothing pacifism is submission to fascism its because of you that we cant rise up so afraid to stand and fight for what you claim to believe in words are not fighting a system words can be ignored a molotov cocktail cant communism comes in blood or it doesnt come basic marx but even if my last sentence above is not true moving on it is still how people look at us when we use violence for violence against the nazis they wonder why we are not willing to use more constructive efforts to move our cause forward this public impression is itself a reason to be cautious publicity should mean everything for socialists at the current stage where our influence is minimal just adding more socialists wont help us if they never do anything i was drawn to socialism when i saw that socialists gave a damn about me and were willing to fight for that punching the fuck out of a nazi draws the good people to us already it drives away the shallow and small minded this is not to say that we should not use violence against fascists but the issue is that we should use it sparingly and when it actually serves a goal right now it does not how about protecting minorites from these fascist thugs that murder us on daily basis neo nazis are learning to stay home because antifa is getting bigger and stronger the nazis are afraid of us we want that and seriously what kind of socialist is so dismissive of the lower class that they are no purpose in halting fascist agression you have so clearly never been afraid that strangers will beat you to death the purpose of violence against nazis is to protect poc lgbt and all minorities from their evil on a material basis this is about saving lives how can you not see how important this is nonviolence will not and cannot stop that only antifa the scarier stronger force can stop it and they can only do it with violence
socialism,not_removed,the two are not mutually exclusive violence against fascists and all reactionaries is necessary for successful revolution
socialism,not_removed,i deleted my comment because i thought i missed the mark slightly in the wording of the joke but i stand by it my point is that by simply calling fascism an opinion you disagree with is ridiculous obviously communists dont advocate violence against anyone they disagree with or theyd be advocating violence against liberals and your average tories when they dont they advocate suppressing fascism because fascists advocate violence against marginalized peoples its an inherently violent political ideology and countering it by any means necessary is self defence its not a matter of sensibilities and opinions its a matter of actual material violence in nazi germany there was a nonviolent antifascist student organization called the white rose i want you to look up what happened to them
socialism,not_removed,i am starting to think that you are right i will definitely think more about this do you possibly have any reading material video or documentary that you would recommend
socialism,not_removed,the simple truth is that td users are scared of the left this is inevitably good however its true we must go beyond simply antifa organizing and overthrow capitalism
socialism,not_removed,i wholeheartedly agree that true fascism is the enemy of a free society however i dislike that the word fascism is considered equal to constitutional conservatism in fact the two are actually on opposite ends of the spectrum when you consider the actual definitions of the two fascism relies upon radical nationalism which means suppression of the rights of the people to benefit the state any dissent is punished by a centralized government that controls the policemilitary directly constitutional conservatism is dedicated to preserving the rights promised by the bill of rights constitution this includes free speech the right to bear arms the right to privacy ect while constitutional conservatism also relies upon nationalism it is dedicated to preserving the rights of the individual over the majority decentralization of political power is the key pillar that supports this ideology when groups like antifa organize groups of impressionable teenagers to go around assaulting people based upon their political beliefs it only serves to hurt your cause the vast majority of americans only want to get the economy moving in a positive direction and for the debt of the country to be addressed by the countrys leaders make america great again is not an inherently racistfascist statement it is the equivalent of obamas hope and change campaign where it means something different to each individual but ultimately promotes an upbeat outlook of the future to slander and assault these people will drive them further from your own views and serves to divide us when we should be reconciling
socialism,not_removed,trotskys fascism and how to fight it thats all off the top of my head i apologize in hindsight for being so hostile
socialism,not_removed,the simple truth is that td users are scared of the left theyre scared because theyre not warlike especially td users most of them are just regular people who go to work pay their taxes and their rent and dont want anything to interfere in that no matter how miserable their financial situation may become that is why they are antiimmigrant antiblack antisocialist etc its a competely different mindset from ours
socialism,not_removed,i dont think socialists care what nonsocialists think is bad for the cause because they dont believe in the cause but towards your other points i dislike that the word fascism is considered equal to constitutional conservatism i dont think it is antifa its not an acronym isnt going around beating up tories im sure some have but its a decentralized nonorganizational phenomenon so what one person or group does isnt very material to the larger phenomenon fascism relies upon radical nationalism among other things but agreed when groups like antifa organize groups of impressionable teenagers to go around assaulting people based upon their political beliefs it only serves to hurt your cause lol so were all teenagers now such a bizarre claim considering how many communist revolutions were led by and participated in by you know adults also see above why should i care what you think hurts or helps my cause make america great again is not an inherently racistfascist statement arguably is deutschland uber alles an inherently fascist statement i certainly dont think all trump supporters are fascists but its a motto of trumps a man who i do believe is fascist or at the very least has strong fascistic tendencies and sympathies to slander and assault these people will drive them further from your own views and serves to divide us when we should be reconciling we cant reconcile class conflict its not something that can be solved through compromise because the two sides are diametrically opposed like slave and slavemaster there is no compromise position between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat our society will either be oppressive or it will not perhaps some individual members of the proletariat may be alienated but frankly thats the cost of doing business
socialism,not_removed,theyre scared because theyre not warlike fascists arent warlike they may not like it when they get attacked but they definitely love to attack others
socialism,not_removed,i dont think socialists care what nonsocialists think is bad for the cause because they dont believe in the cause im only giving my opinion from the opposing side i hoped i could give my opinion in the most rational way possible so that the people that frequent this sub could try and understand what its like from the outsidelookingin perspective i dont think it is antifa its not an acronym isnt going around beating up tories im sure some have but its a decentralized nonorganizational phenomenon so what one person or group does isnt very material to the larger phenomenon while antifa is not targeting tories specifically they are targeting anyone and everyone who has an opinion that differs in any way shape or form to their own it has a striking similarity to the very ideology it has pledged to fight lol so were all teenagers now such a bizarre claim considering how many communist revolutions were led by and participated in by you know adults i did not mean to insinuate that antifa is comprised of children but there are young people attached to the organization whose futures are put in question by inflammatory rhetoric that encourages them to assault people and damage public property why should i care what you think hurts or helps my cause you dont have to feel free to ignore the opinions of others to your own detriment i always thought that it was the goal of any political group to try and appeal to as many people as possible i certainly dont think all trump supporters are fascists but its a motto of trumps a man who i do believe is fascist or at the very least has strong fascistic tendencies and sympathies if you honestly think that he is a fascist then all you have to do is let him try and implement his policies the constitution has many protections against any particular branch of government seizing power with the possible exception of the judicial branch which should be addressed if it turns out that he is a tyrannical underhanded ruler then he will be impeached and the problem resolved we cant reconcile class conflict its not something that can be solved through compromise because the two sides are diametrically opposed like slave and slavemaster there is no compromise position between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat our society will either be oppressive or it will not perhaps some individual members of the proletariat may be alienated but frankly thats the cost of doing business honestly this is the hardest pill to swallow here youve declared that all employers are evil and need to be taken down when in reality they are the people that are providing the means for you to live your life if nobody worked if nobody took a risk in starting their own business if nobody tried to better themselves so they could increase their quality of life then nothing would get done and humanity would be all the worse for it
socialism,not_removed,i dont consider the average edgy td poster to be fascist if you asked any one of them if theyre racist or racialist they would overwhelmingly claim no actual fascist will not pretend to be accepting especially when anonymous most td users still do not to mention they still toe the muh free markets and meritocracy party line this also shows they have not actually embraced the alt rights ideology which goes against that
socialism,not_removed,im only giving my opinion from the opposing side sure i dont mean to shit on you but honestly weve been doing as were doing for the last years and well probably keep on doing the same its important that radicals dont water down their message for the sake of palatability after all concern trolling is a real thing they are targeting anyone and everyone who has an opinion that differs in any way shape or form to their own thats simply not true and with the antifascists are the real fascists all i can do is roll my eyes its such a tired cliche there are young people attached to the organization whose futures are put in question by what about the young people whose lives are put in danger by fascism you cant just stop being a minority if you honestly think that he is a fascist then all you have to do is let him try and implement his policies just what i cant even handle this lol what makes america invulnerable to a coup that wasnt there for germany or any other country i can normally at least see the logic in liberalconservative arguments but this is just complete nonsense political power grows from the barrel of a gun not from any document or idea if trump had the military power to seize the government no amount of checks and balances is going to stop him here youve declared that all employers are evil and need to be taken down as individuals im sure many of them are quite friendly and genuinely kindhearted people but they perform a systematically exploitative role in society just like anecdotes dont tell us anything individuals dont matter in understanding the world what matters is understanding the systematic relationships between people in our societies and that relationship is an inherently exploitative one if you want the argument behind that youll have to actually read some marx et al i cant just regurgitate it onto reddit when in reality they are the people that are providing the means for you to live your life capitalists create nothing it is the working class and the exploited who have in every era fed us all the products of the labourer are exploited and then generously given back what they have appropriated when it suits them if nobody worked if nobody took a risk in starting their own business if nobody tried to better themselves so they could increase their quality of life then nothing would get done and humanity would be all the worse for it not sure what capitalism has to do with working people have worked for all of human history and they dont need slave drivers to motivate them to do it
socialism,not_removed,sure i dont mean to shit on you but honestly weve been doing as were doing for the last years and well probably keep on doing the same its important that radicals dont water down their message for the sake of palatability after all concern trolling is a real thing this is fine i have no qualms about spreading your message and ideals to people its the method by which they antifa and their ilk do so that troubles me with the antifascists are the real fascists all i can do is roll my eyes its such a tired cliche im sure youve heard this argument before but the tactics used by antifa can be compared to httpsenwikipediaorgwikisturmabteilung where they participated in destruction of property and the assault of citizens to spread their message and stifle the viewpoints of others the main reason this is so troubling to me is because as far as i know nobody in the leadership of antifa has condemned the violence and destruction which leads to an image of hypocrisy surrounding the organization just what i cant even handle this lol what makes america invulnerable to a coup that wasnt there for germany or any other country i can normally at least see the logic in liberalconservative arguments but this is just complete nonsense political power grows from the barrel of a gun not from any document or idea if trump had the military power to seize the government no amount of checks and balances is going to stop him do you honestly think that american soldiers would oppress their own people do you honestly think that either side of the political spectrum would allow it this is why the right to bear arms was included in the bill of rights what matters is understanding the systematic relationships between people in our societies and that relationship is an inherently exploitative one id argue that it is mutually beneficial with labor laws in place workers are no longer exploited to the degree that marx wrote about capitalists create nothing it is the working class and the exploited who have in every era fed us all a capitalist designed and created the computer keyboard monitor router and internet infrastructure you just used to send this message the products of the labourer are exploited and then generously given back what they have appropriated when it suits them isnt this the definition of socialism instead of being held accountable to an employer for your work with the guarantee that you will be compensated for it the fruits of your labor are instead given to the government to be spread around based upon their own metric not sure what capitalism has to do with working people have worked for all of human history and they dont need slave drivers to motivate them to do it capitalism promotes technological innovation through the basic fundamental characteristic of human greed its the carrotstick motivation argument if you take away the carrot all you have left is the stick
socialism,not_removed,i suggest you brush up on your readings about fascism i would suggest you do the same the average supporter of trump may be many things but fascists they arent fascism doesnt mean anything right of center it is a specific ideology trumpism is more a populist leaning more nationalist version of american neoconservatism
socialism,not_removed,isnt that the definition of socialism no it isnt socialism is worker self management you seem like a decent enough person but we cant even really have this conversation because you quite frankly dont know the basics of socialism thats not an attack its just an observation its not like this stuff gets taught in school i highly recommend you look through the sidebar here because unless you take the time to actually read and understand the socialist critique of capitalism any conversation you have on the matter is just going to be two people talking past each other
socialism,not_removed,a perfect definition of fascism has been a bone of contention among political scholars but some of the general agreements feature an ubernationalism guided by a sort of new national myth created out of an idealized past economic thinking that isnt exactly left or right often but always an overt racial component that is explicit and a sort of liturgical style of rhetoric designed to mobilize the middle and under class against a perceived national enemy fascism attacks both liberalism and conservatism equally as it rejects core tenets of both trump is more neocon with paleoconservative leanings who makes overtures to populism he hasnt wholesale rejected american conservatism rather hes adopted it and is attempting to push it around non of his policies are particularly new in the history of american political discourse the idea of some form of border obstacle has been floating around both sides for decades economic protectionism has been a favorite talking point of conservatives though one they are loathe to carry through on bolstering military spending is again fairly typical neocon fair hell even the nuclear modernization hes been saber rattling about is a policy that was already happening before he took office various presidents in history have had hostile relationships with the media truman for instance refused to participate in various media affairs and railed against them at times the only things really new are his ham handed handling of immigration enforcement and his potential ties to russia other than that none of this is new rather its that the the media and the establishment both left and right in america have found one president that supports a large number of policies that happen to piss all of them off
socialism,not_removed,that depends on how you define it has there been small largely unimportant fascist parties of course however if you are defining elements of fascism as being minor ideological overlaps spread among various parties im not sure thats a fair point to make fascism is ultranationalistic but does a party that contains an element of nationalism contain an element of fascism i dont think thats an adequate argument
socialism,not_removed,not typically ultra nationalism is the realm of racial purity policies rampant xenophobia elevating the state to godhood etc while some may caricature it as being that far right its really no where near it
socialism,not_removed,please explain the fascist base of the united states then im sorry but im simply not convinced that there is sufficient evidence that fascism has any real cultural currency in the united states unless you take liberties with the meaning of the word one of the problems i see with socialist cultural and political critiques is that through that lens everything not socialist begins to look like a shade of fascism
socialism,not_removed,that picture shows nothing but income inequality
socialism,not_removed,it was a very sad day in brazil
socialism,not_removed,are they doing this to prevent a tidal wave of a selloff didnt brazils stock market already completely implode
socialism,not_removed,the market is enjoying the permanent austerity sorry if its not right spelled measures coming from the temp president
socialism,not_removed,no the stock market is in fact as healthy as ever these measures are being taken so that the government can be free to pay interest on public debt to the detriment of spending in public services health education etc
socialism,not_removed,this is a really great concept and really puts the laborcapital dichotomy into a whole new perspective in a simple way
socialism,not_removed,in one light is almost impressive that capitalism even managed to make the planet pay in order to sustain its overproduction also fuck i like earth honestly what are we supposed to do entire nations and cultures will be lost andor destroyed because of the affects of climate change
socialism,not_removed,liberals are going to fail hard in coping with the consequences communities sticking together and helping each other will play a bigger role in the future opening up a new space for agitation and revolution the only shit is that the people will win a world which is doomed to become uninhabitable i am afraid its all too late especially in the light of
socialism,not_removed,if anyone has any free time should watch john pilgers documentary the coming war on china aside from showcasing how this war is possible he also showcases some of the horrific nuclear tests so to speak the us did to native pacific islanders and how the continued military presence by the us is causing problems for local populaces very interesting piece of film
socialism,not_removed,is anyone educated enough to speculate as to what that would look like i knew trump was escalating tensions but i didnt know it was to the extent this suggests what kinds of circumstances would lead to war between china and the us what other powers might get involved obviously itd be bad but how bad this isnt a scenario ive really considered a ton and its pretty frightening
socialism,not_removed,my kinda interpritation of how things may play out is the us strengthening its position in the pacific while china continues its land reclamation at a higher rate standoffs would probably be common hopefully backroom stuff and deterrence would prevent this however it is most likely that if conflict were to break out that fighting would at least initially be a fight in the pacific and probably the philippines given its position with other sorts of air skirmishes and cruise missile throwing itd escalate most likely with either an invasion of japan by china if japan were to engage in war or an american invasion of vietnam both are strategically important countries for various reasons the naval war would likely be one sided towards the americans given the size and experience of the us navy from there youd see escalation and a broadening of this hypothetical war in terms of manpower weapons employed depending on how things go tactical nuclear weapons may be employed by one side or the other and from there well i doubt itd go strategic nuclear war ie target everything with nukes but itd get real ugly as for allies id put money on china being joined possibly by vietnam and because theyre more unpredictable than trump north korea while the us could probebly draw in s korea taiwan and possibly japan id think that russia france britian and other major powers would probably stay out if america fires first
socialism,not_removed,things are escalating because of chinas south sea america has been instigating in the recent past and china doesnt back off things are bad china will not stop defending its territory and usa will not stop being an imperialist instigating country
socialism,not_removed,russia would support china but not directly vietnam would absolutely be a us ally philippines and possibly indonesia would support china this is assuming both governments dont go straight to the nukes
socialism,not_removed,excellent conjecture also keep in mind game theory and immediate tactical economic deployment ie were gonna give you hella stuff so just stay out if you wont fight for us its more than likely the us will start another war on terror in places like the philippines or indonesia just like you said there are significant muslim populations there perfect excuse another is proxy wars in north korea itself gotta take care of those dern communists with other ridiculous capitalist pretenses the big one to look out for in case backroom deals and common sense completely fall to the wayside is another of sorts but a chinese maybe a major cyber attack who knows and anyone with a modicum of sense in this era will know who to really blame when the us declares war on terror in china and they laugh us off with nukes and a superior production infrastructure nobody wins in war and we the people become the losers divided we are thieves together we are people
socialism,not_removed,cleganebowl confirmed
socialism,not_removed,also the perfect worker in a capitalist society
socialism,not_removed,or as seamus kennedy noted muscles are required intelligence not essential
socialism,not_removed,its qyburn and the mountain
socialism,not_removed,sir robert strong so does this confirm that he just took off gregors head no head hype
socialism,not_removed,get hype
socialism,not_removed,haha i was not expecting this here
socialism,not_removed,that show is feudalist propaganda
socialism,not_removed,you kidding he looks far too healthy
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,no in the books they say you can see the flesh of his face through his helmet he always wears and its all gross hes a zombie type thing i guess it could be someone elses head but he has a head
socialism,not_removed,i still think they sowed joffreys head onto him mysa is a master
socialism,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofauthoritarianregimessupportedbytheunitedstates
socialism,not_removed,fuck you too buddy
socialism,not_removed,care to explain edit oh memorial day did not see that
socialism,not_removed,no it isnt what makes you think that liberal if anything tolkien actually was feudalistic propaganda martins series is meant to be an opposition to that in a lot of ways
socialism,not_removed,his job offers benefi nvm i cant finish that with a straight face
socialism,not_removed,lets please try not to use globalresearchca as a source in the future i know that this particular story is true but it is run by conspiracy loons and is generally a wretched hive of scum and villainy
socialism,not_removed,thats to stop cops from getting bored if a cop is a genuis and gets bored or decides he knows more than his superior he could slack disobey commands or just go do his own thing when he is needed the same is said for army men soldiers cant be smart enough to question orders they need to do what theyre when theyre told to work as a group under their leaders control i know this example is a reach and might not be understood by some but look at esports anyone can play dota or csgo and get good at through practice but professional teams are far above regular pub matches largely due to teamwork they have a captain that calls allmost of the shots and they work together as one unit to win tldr they might not listen and get someone injured or killed
socialism,not_removed,in the books they barely describe him at all they dont say whether or not you can see any flesh
socialism,not_removed,im actually surprised that article was allowed to stand on wikipedia and the bureaucratic admins didnt delete it for being too biased or whatever liberal rhetoric they use sort of like the mass killings under capitalist regimes article
socialism,not_removed,this has nothing to do with the average us military enlisted person
socialism,not_removed,why did you think there was so much antiwar stuff today
socialism,not_removed,i think it was a joke
socialism,not_removed,if anything i get an antiwar vibe at least from the books
socialism,not_removed,kingslaying is considered bad honor bounds you to serve your lord lords are nice and cool and protect you peasants should be grateful at all times and never complain knights are the good guys everyone has their place as decreed by blood very rare to accomplish anything if youre low born and if you do its celebrated as an exception most loved character tyrion is a dude with golden spoon up his ass that never does anything except drink and talk and throw gold around that he never earned stannis is a spook infested man whose sense of duty and right blind him from reason brienne is ruled by oaths and spends her life in servitude unable to think on her own daenerys tries abolishing slavery and is shown as a terrible ruler and society is worse off because of it she never earned a single thing she has and is single mindedly focused on her rightful place as queen jorah an ex slaver is a hero i can go on its pretyt obvious to me
socialism,not_removed,i remembered the story and looked for a headline that matched i dont know the site duly noted
socialism,not_removed,i dont even know where to begin soldiers cant be smart enough to question orders dont tell me you actually support this
socialism,not_removed,thats weird i just read them again recently and could have sworn that cercei sees graygreen flesh through the eyeholes of his helmet i thought there was something about glittering eyes as well
socialism,not_removed,and memorial day in this country has become about glorifying military service and sacrifice to a level that even a lot of soldiers find insane that fervor then helps to push even more young men and women into dying for their country
socialism,not_removed,except the fact they volunteer to join an organisation that does these things there is a huge differance between a conscript or a volunteer defending his country in face of invasion and someone choosing to join up in a time of relative peace to largely invade other countries for their leaders commercial gain
socialism,not_removed,surely it all ties into jingoism and self interest although i am aware that there are many in the us who arent aware of some of that support httpsenwikipediaorgwikiunitedstateswarcrimes
socialism,not_removed,it has everything to do they are a key element im supporting these regimes if they had any moral or ethics they would quite and boycott the army and usa
socialism,not_removed,did not know it was memorial day for the us i can see why the guy is upset aswell since even though this day is used as serving patriotism the soldiers that died still deserve to be recognized in an honorable way
socialism,not_removed,haha oh shit fair enough then weirdly there are actually fantasy books that glorify feudalism so unfortunately i didnt find the claim that far fetched
socialism,not_removed,it wasnt a joke they respond further down the thread
socialism,not_removed,the broken men speech is clearly antiwar and is one of the most moving parts of the entire series
socialism,not_removed,i think youre accidentally conflating the ideology of those within a fictional world and the ideology which drives the fiction its self
socialism,not_removed,by this logic any show the contains a capitalist characters must be capitalist propaganda because the characters think in ways anyone would in that environment kingslaying is considered bad by characters i dont think any actual readers or show watchers think slaying the madking was bad honor bounds you to serve your lord thats because the setting is in a feudalistic society and thats how feudalism works lords are nice and cool and protect you except all the people who act like the mountain peasants should be grateful at all times and never complain this may be how lords think but thats how all lords would think in that environment the story actually shows that they probably should be head over hills for their lords most loved character tyrion is a dude with golden spoon up his ass that never does anything except drink and talk and throw gold around that he never earned and stannis is a spook infested man whose sense of duty and right blind him from reason so the imagined portrayal of how lower classes should obey higher classes is bad but the actual portrayal of blind devotion to feudalistic dutey is also bad k brienne is ruled by oaths and spends her life in servitude unable to think on her own because in the society this story is set in that is ideally how a knight should be daenerys tries abolishing slavery and is shown as a terrible ruler and society is worse off because of it she never earned a single thing she has and is single mindedly focused on her rightful place as queen jorah an ex slaver is a hero society is only worse off for it because regime change can be messy and the fact that shes a year old trying to rule over a culture she doesnt know i also think well see her become a better ruler in books six and seven well jorah is an ex slaver who is now helping a girl who is freeing slaves and trying to crush the slave trade of a region so
socialism,not_removed,only in pov chapters from the upper classes themselves though you are seeing this world from their perspective from other perspectives like the wildings or brotherhood without banners you see a differant picture a big theme from the books is that you are in a differant characters head every chapter
socialism,not_removed,dude they recently had an episode where tyrion decides to reason with the slave owners basically explaining that capitalism allows them to get rich without having the word slavery and he comes off as totally out of touch the show consistently portrays everyone as bad
socialism,not_removed,spoiler the people perceive the kingslayer as heroic for killing the mad king no as well as king joffreys murder the peasants are supposed to be happy with their king no matter what but they threw poo at king joffrey harassed cercei as she marched nude through the city and in one recent episode they made a satirical play about king robert danaerys is purposely portrayed as inexperienced and a little conceited jorah was banished twice for being a slaver being born a lower class does mean youre an exception if you accomplish anything thats just the unfortunate reality and a relevant part of history in regards to politics
socialism,not_removed,kingslaying is considered bad the character who does that jaime lannister is portrayed in a positive light in the show at least at the moment honor bounds you to serve your lord thats an aspect of feudalism not a reason to support it lords are nice and cool and protect you ah yes i love falling into the loving embrace of walder frey everyone has their place as decreed by blood very rare to accomplish anything if youre low born and if you do its celebrated as an exception just like real feudalism most loved character tyrion is a dude with golden spoon up his ass that never does anything except drink and talk and throw gold around that he never earned hes loved because hes been abused all of his life sympathy and is one of the wittiest and most intelligent characters on the shownot because hes rich stannis is a spook infested man whose sense of duty and right blind him from reason he also burnt his own daughter to death youre not exactly supposed to like him brienne is ruled by oaths and spends her life in servitude unable to think on her own not exactly propaganda thats how some people think in real life daenerys tries abolishing slavery and is shown as a terrible ruler and society is worse off because of it she never earned a single thing she has and is single mindedly focused on her rightful place as queen jorah an ex slaver is a hero daenerys is hated mainly by the former slave masters who are portrayed as antagonists as for jorah he would not be on danys side if he had not renounced his slaveowning sympathies at some point tldr it hasnt got any political motivations stop trying to find them unless youre trolling in which case good trolling
socialism,not_removed,i dont think they were just presenting it from the view of the people that want soldiers which is what the thread is about to be a certain way the cop thing is fairly wellestablished but i always heard the economic side in that a bored person will seek other career opportunities having wasted training and experience and now the department has to recruit to fill the position again
socialism,not_removed,httpsiytimgcomvifwlovjrrdycmaxresdefaultjpg that is basically what it looks like
socialism,not_removed,no shit sherlock but shitting on enlisted personnel is missing the point its the higherups in our society that are responsible for that sort of propaganda and military worship they push it because it benefits them your average grunt has no control over what regimes our leaders decide to topple this week and its fucking stupid to blame them for it the picture in the op and the comment i was replying to are both dumb as fuck
socialism,not_removed,proletarians volunteer to work and enrich their capitalist leaders commercial gain too
socialism,not_removed,every military has had shitheads that commit crimes and warcrimes that still doesnt have anything to do with the average us military enlisted person if you knew anything about the military which you clearly dont given your generalizations youd know that the vast majority of mosratesjobs that exist within it dont directly involve guns or weapons or killing or what have you and for a lot of enlisted people signing their souls over to uncle sam for years is the best way to both save some money and afford to go to college gi bill with college degrees being the new hs diploma and with tuition rates as high and exclusionary as they are i simply cannot fault anyone who serves a enlistment for those reasons obviously the us military has done many reprehensible things but those acts are mostly the fault of the brass and our politicians not your average pog sitting behind a desk doing paperwork and hating his life note i am not in the military at least not yet who knows if my financial aid got cut id probably join but i do pt sometimes with the poolees down at the marine corps recruiting station down the street from where i work its cool and its cheaper than an nyc gym membership and the recruiters are funny dudes none of these kids signed up for the marines so they could kill hadjis or drop bodies or whatever dumb civvies might assume they come from innercity schools and this is their only ticket to a better life and i gotta say i empathize with that
socialism,not_removed,of course its a true travesty that they had to die for such stupid reasons the trick is to somehow do that without honoring the state that sent them to die
socialism,not_removed,yeah people generally proletarians have fought suffered lived and died for worthy causes against imperialists and fascists or in revolution against the oppressors at home nonviolence does not always suit the material conditions socialists may be thinking about the national liberation front or the red army or others today even if it is a propatriotic us holiday rip che did nothing wrong edit
socialism,not_removed,i always interpreted lotr as leninist
socialism,not_removed,i think you give too much significance to the ideology driving the show it doesnt matter what the writershowrunner wants to portray the only thing that matters is how audiences perceive it and in that sense people look at the fictional world and think certain parts of it are cool like lords and kings and knights in fact its very rare imo to portray feudalist times in a piece of entertainment without accidentally evoking a sense of nostalgia for it its like all these video games and fantasy shows that spurn cosplays and fanfics edit for example the other day i was playing this game called wolfenstein new order which takes place in an althistory where nazis won wwii despite the fact that you play as a one man nazi killing machine it still portrays nazis as superhumans who made the world a better place non intentional propaganda
socialism,not_removed,kingslayer is a pejorative they mock him for killing the king which is a high dishonor speaking of which honour rules everything in the story the walk of shame was supposed to make us feel bad for cercei and the commoners are portrayed as simplistic brutes in the play the aristocrats were the heroes
socialism,not_removed,this post isnt shitting on the troops though its shitting on the fact that the perfect soldier in the eyes of the brass and government is one without a brain
socialism,not_removed,true i get where you are coming from but a line has to be drawn somewhere for example during most of british history soldiers were almost universally hated by the working class booed in the streets refused service in pubs we always had a volunteer army although most joined up as a last resort i think that is a healthy attitude towards a standing peacetime army the attitude changed after but that military were almost all volunteers fighting nazi germany all left after the war and voted for the most left wing government we ever had the military and the right has been riding off their glory ever since in times like this military service should be discouraged by disrespecting professional soldiers
socialism,not_removed,i fully agree with this but the one thing i would say is that the kids you know dont necessarily represent everyone in the military im from a pretty rural area with a nearby air force base and a pretty high percentage of kids go straight into the military after high school a majority of them are extreme racists champing at the bit to kill brown people especially the marines and army thats not why they join they join because theyre poor and unfit for college but the murder is an added bonus not a necessary evil of course thats also true of civilians in this area because its a very poor very white part of the us but youre right that they are victims of circumstance as much as anyone else and it would be wrong to blame imperialism on them plus as you say most dont see real combat
socialism,not_removed,every military has had shitheads that commit crimes and warcrimes except for the fact war crimes are sanctioned by the state and hushed up when they happen personal responsibility is a thing and if you sign up to any nato military youll eventually be directly or indirectly facilitating some poor brown blokes door getting kicked in before hes kidnapped renditioned tortured and disappeared by our brave boys lets face it if youre in the military youre a class traitor and an imperialist
socialism,not_removed,exactly
socialism,not_removed,what the fuck are you on about
socialism,not_removed,if youre trying to get a political message from lotr beyond catholicism is pretty cool youre not in for a good time
socialism,not_removed,i suppose you could but the antiindustrialization motifs are considered by some to be a kind of harking back to feudalism the book does seem to offer some aspects of feudalistic society as pretty positive making me think tolkien was up for going back rather than forward
socialism,not_removed,explain please
socialism,not_removed,i suppose youre right but surely thats just a problem with western culture in general which obviously contributes to the shaping of any fiction glorification of conflict with knights and such is kind of a thematic issue in lots of stuff since way back but i still think got portrays a harsh world which most people wouldnt want to live in making it a breath of fresh air in a genre which doesnt do that often and shows how feudalistic power dynamics are the cause of these problems so to me that makes it unfair to suggest it promotes feudalism
socialism,not_removed,i think more people would agree with you if they werent invested in the series i personally cant stand watching it for the exact reasons you gave
socialism,not_removed,it doesnt matter what the writershowrunner wants to portray the only thing that matters is how audiences perceive it you just gave me flashbacks of my literary theory classes death to the author
socialism,not_removed,i guess youre correct and after reading your response to the other commenter i do agree that it is unintentional propaganda
socialism,not_removed,so then what was the point of your first comment i would never defend the imperialist actions of the us state and i agree that memorial day is used as a propaganda tool by the government i just think that linking enlisted personnel with the crimes against humanity that the us government has committed is in bad taste today we should be remembering the poor men and women who were put in positions to die so that powerful people could profit from it not blaming them they were taken advantage of just as the working class is
socialism,not_removed,a massive drawdown in the size of a standing military isnt even up to the military its all political clearly there is no need for the us to have a million military personnel and a military budget thats like times higher than chinas but shaming regular military personnel wont do anything except make you look like a dick its like yelling pig at a cop whos just standing there minding his own business doesnt accomplish anything fighting the entire capitalist system as a whole is the only way well ever put an end to it all including the militaryindustrial complex and imperialism
socialism,not_removed,i agree with that im not from a rural area never have lived in one so none of the dep kids i know are the type of racist hick types that want to kill brown people for murica so im probably a bit biased america does have massive issues with racism and ultranationalism and that definitely leaks into the military
socialism,not_removed,funny how some people pick and choose when personal responsibility becomes a thing poor person shoots a cop material conditions poor person joins the military for a chance at improving their life class traitor imperialist scum both actions are the result of a persons material conditions some poor brown blokes door getting kicked in before hes kidnapped renditioned tortured and disappeared by our brave boys i guarantee that the average grunt does not want to kidnap innocent people blame our ruling class for using mostly good men and women to further their own malevolent goals an imperialist the average grunt probably doesnt even know what that means you only need to score percentile on the asvab like a wayeasier multiple choice satact to become a marine or a soldier those people arent the ones plotting to advance the interests of western governments and multinational corporations im telling you your hatred is misplaced and enlisted personnel are treated like shit by the us government just like the working class is they are a means to an end not the perpetrators of our fuckedup system
socialism,not_removed,it seem hes advocating proletarian patriotism over nationalist patriotism
socialism,not_removed,sorry edited my comment just now but was agreeing with this i can see why the guy is upset aswell since even though this day is used as serving patriotism the soldiers that died still deserve to be recognized in an honorable way
socialism,not_removed,i tend to associate antiindustrialization motifs with the desire of the working class to attain food security for itself agriculture represents the ability of the proletariat to exchange labour for their own physical needs directly the more anything is mechanized and industrialized the greater the emphasis on the ownership of the mechanisms this creates a quandary the owners can create control over others just by peacefully enriching themselves this is the insidious power of the ring representing the individual desire for wealth and private property just as you cant just kill sauron you cant just kill the owners if the desire for wealth remains so too does the marrow of capitalism black tendrils of control will seep out and create disparity and alienation until it becomes unresolvable except with violence imo the backtotheland impulse is a reflection of our individual desire to resolve capitalist exploitation peacefully with selfdetermination of our labour and trade at some point backtothelanders have made the true realization that capitalist society is not for them it is not for anyone but the owners so they desire to make their own society using their own labour to meet their needs instead of depending on an exploitative apparatus tolkien makes a great deal of commentary on the role of individual motivations within states government and the world
socialism,not_removed,tolkien identified as an anarchomonarchist at one point is an essay expanding on that i would say he was on the right but had a great deal of sympathy for the left which is probably why lord of the rings has a broad appeal to hippies and white nationalists alike
socialism,not_removed,tolkein described himself as somewhat facetiously an anarchomonarchist i suspect tolkein mostly just didnt care enough about politics to think about it all that much
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,maybe i was too harsh but i know people who worship characters like lannister knight dude and denaerys which is really stupid
socialism,not_removed,so then what was the point of your first comment because by extension the comment you first replied to was posting that article in reference to the submission cartoon and thus military leaders not average us enlisted military personnel
socialism,not_removed,it does have an effect when noone wants to join up that is the situation the uk has had for most of history out army is limited by the number of people willing to do it im not talking about actually shitting on them in public fuck my cousin is a soldier i often thought of joining the royal navy reserves myself as im a merchant seaman but in the usas case it wouldnt hurt to tone down the completely over the top military worship going up these days it looks very creepy and im certain most soldiers think its rather silly too
socialism,not_removed,if you take up arms in the knowledge you may have to kill people in far away locations and even the most ignorant grunt knows this then you are literally an imperialist
socialism,not_removed,proletarian patriotism what a twisted idea
socialism,not_removed,tolkiens works will never fit into materialist analysis
socialism,not_removed,i suspect tolkein mostly just didnt care enough about politics to think about it all that much imo thats what makes it such a fertile ground for analysis fiction opens us up to dialectical conversations and invites us to make considerations about the other side that we might not have made otherwise when the author has too strong a hand in the political message the writing often suffers and the work alienates readers who arent a member of that ideology ayn rand is a good example its much easier to open up genuine discussion if the story is only vaguely political
socialism,not_removed,agree on that
socialism,not_removed,i like the high sparrow whos basically the ideological love child of pope francis and joseph stalin
socialism,not_removed,oo gotcha sorry for being kind of a dick
socialism,not_removed,oh in that case i agree and yeah most marines ive talked to frankly hate the overthetop shit they see civilians doing to show their support they dont view themselves as heroes just because they served and nobody else should
socialism,not_removed,you gotta realize that these are typically poor kids who have been brainwashed all their lives by nationalist propaganda into believing that what theyre fighting for truly is a just and righteous cause a good chunk of soldiers probably most really genuinely believe that they are fighting for our freedom and thats an admirable thing to do although its clearly not what theyre actually being used for every army is made up of those who dont really know any better fighting for what theyve been led to believe is a just cause isis doesnt think of themselves as villains and neither do us troops we can deplore their actions while empathizing with their situation theyre victims of imperialism like anyone else they just get a better deal
socialism,not_removed,that is a loaded term that should be reserved for the people actually pulling the strings im pretty sure the grunts during the invasion of iraq werent thinking fuck yeah time to make haliburton some money in fact tons of them came back feeling jaded and used fyi im not the one downvoting your comments yours is a valid opinion that i had too before i actually started talking to militaryex military personnel and learning about what they actually do
socialism,not_removed,materialist analysis is where it happens you dont have to fit anything into it shrugs
socialism,not_removed,and a bit of antihonosexuality the brotherhood without banners is where its at uphold thorosismlady stoneheartism
socialism,not_removed,i wonder if you uphold this much sympathy for the nazi jackboots that were just following orders and doing something patriotic for their country vietnam resulted in over half a million vietnamese dead iraq by conservative estimates resulted in at least million dead i do not see the difference between some young dumb arsehole signing up to the army and your average nazi soldier that just wanted a strong fatherland
socialism,not_removed,where can i learn to do materialist analysis zizek does this no
socialism,not_removed,what i pretty obviously i thought meant is that a materialist analysis of tolkeins works especially regarding themes of pastoralismagrarianism and industrialization is inherently incomplete theyre spiritual works by their very nature
socialism,not_removed,he does yes learn by doing its very easy you just need to watch it with your ideological lens and think about how each character and their respective motivation fits into the class struggle if you arent used to doing this try doing it with real people and historical figures first absorb art interpret art zesty dialectics
socialism,not_removed,theyre racist sexist and can go fuck off defenders of leftypol will be banned on sight unless youre defending the memes the memes are pretty dank
socialism,not_removed,for one i cannot stand the website style so that kills everything for me im sure all the dank commie maymays originate from there though
socialism,not_removed,you can disagree with their stances towards identity politics but its a bit ridiculous to call them liberals or even nazis considering they fight them off almost daily and oppose racism sexism etc they reflexively oppose identity politics because they see it as something that liberals and conservatives use to divide the working class and in the case of the liberals tend to get socialists swept up in it as well i recall seeing the term bernie bro used here unironically several times despite it being a manufactured controversy created because the original attempt to claim all bernie supporters were men proved false
socialism,not_removed,theyre so shit i prefer not to think of them
socialism,not_removed,leftypol has some really great discussion although its also got its fair share of bigots i cant fault anybody by being bothered by the sites atmosphere it is after all a chan community
socialism,not_removed,i think we should very seriously pushback against neoreactionaries using our jargon and imagery because they find it equally as edgy as fascist jargon and imagery
socialism,not_removed,saw plenty of fascistcapitalist spam last time i was lurking on it
socialism,not_removed,lot of people defending an openly racist and sexist institution itt like sorry if you are a white man who uses the n word pejoratively i really dont think youre a person i want to talk to real socialist or not
socialism,not_removed,great memes but absolutely brocialist through and through they dont believe there is a gender pay gap they use christina hoff sommers as a source unironically being a marxist feminist on the board is a bannable offence and they even often side with the views of sargon of akkad and milo yanniopolis they are absolutely misogynistic they deny it of course but their anti idpol stance is from a position of reaction not socialism they hate the ideas of feminism not the liberal structures
socialism,not_removed,its all the racism and sexism of normal pol with about as much fascism on a good day they are not our comrades even calling them brocialists is frankly an insult to brocialists
socialism,not_removed,their politics are absolute shit but they have decent memes
socialism,not_removed,they are utter scum no two ways about it
socialism,not_removed,anarcho is a better leftist area especially for ancoms posting is a bit thin but nonetheless the people are generally socially aware most criticize the ml circlejerk of leftypol but you still get the whole offensiveness of being on a chan minus the racism and sexism of course
socialism,not_removed,in general is icky from what ive heard
socialism,not_removed,i would rather have them transition to real socialism then have them descend into the neoreaction
socialism,not_removed,itt racism is okay because its just the chans
socialism,not_removed,their memes are quite shit honestly just copy and pasting that soviet cartoon of the bourgie and saying spook every other word
socialism,not_removed,is this really a responsible way for a mod to be utilizing hisher power it certainly doesnt seem fit for a socialist sub in my perspective at least
socialism,not_removed,whoa there cowboy if i wanted to get banned on sight for nuanced views id be in rfullcommunism that being said yes many of the reactionary strains of behavior from pol have carried over to leftypol but when discussion there gets good it can actually get good that does not excuse their general behavior and terrible stances on racegender issues but its not as if that place has zero positive qualities that being said i havent browsed it more than a couple times so maybe i avoided the worst of it i know their website bunkermag has had some pretty good writing though
socialism,not_removed,i wouldnt go so far as to say they oppose racism and sexism but every time pol waltzes in they have legitimately cogent and impressively unbigoted responses to their idiocy so i definitely dont think theyre reactionaries just edgy reformed who have a kneejerk reaction to idpol frankly i have much better discussions on leftypol more frequently than i ever do on reddits lefty boards their rabid response to anything that even hints at identity politics is frankly silly but i understand the origin and quite honestly its a lot more productive than the not my comrade stuff i see here to the genuine exclusion of any real radical class based conversation
socialism,not_removed,when they brigaded sls and fc they used no shortage of racistsexist terms and phrases
socialism,not_removed,they fight them off almost daily and oppose racism sexism etc ive never seen anyone on leftypol do that ever and they generally love gratuitous use of the nword so
socialism,not_removed,is there a shining moment of their antiracistsexismetc stance right now they seem on the same page as republican turned libertariangary johnson type lets say friends that is to say not much
socialism,not_removed,not youre truly dipping into identity politics if i push broscialism but i am a woman its ok because of my identity
socialism,not_removed,on the last their points arent invalid but theres also ben carsonfirst to come to mind and rredpillwomen so while i wont dismiss them out of hand it doesnt always mean they jive with the specific issues that come with being a member of that group for some reason or another
socialism,not_removed,is a liberal just anyone you disagree with theyre definitely hard left mostly marxist leninists and the complete antithesis of liberals
socialism,not_removed,a brocialist is just a term you use to denounce basically anyone who isnt on board with the almost exclusive focus on superstructure identity politics over base materialism our means of production its not an argument its barely even a statement its just kneejerk hatred towards people who believe that the left has become overly consumed by identity politics and that this is a detriment to both class struggle and gender equality
socialism,not_removed,thats dank as fuck seems like what you want is some fresh memes
socialism,not_removed,is it responsible for a mod to use their power to stop people apologising for and supporting racism and sexism on a socialist subreddit the answer is obvious
socialism,not_removed,so i definitely dont think theyre reactionaries just edgy reformed who have a kneejerk reaction to idpol their rabid response to anything that even hints at identity politics is frankly sill this is the biggest problem with leftypol they may be left wing but the channer hatred of feminism is still ingrained through and through as i have debated people on leftypol on this point countless times and countless times theyve resorted to literally throwing farright pol arguments in my face to why feminism is shit not critiques of the structure of liberal idpol legitimate womens issues are not real feminists made up the pay gap patriarchy doesnt exist etc etc the admin and mods are fully blown gamergaters as well one of my biggest issues with leftypol isnt this its how accommodating they are of farright views in their attempted conversion of pol users instead of pointing out why pol is completely full of shit you often see arguments that completely skirt around the racism and sexism and even join in on it
socialism,not_removed,its a lot more productive than the not my comrade stuff i see here to the genuine exclusion of any real radical class based conversation hear hear to that my comrade im trans and pansexual but for fucks sake do i hate it when identity politics get in the way of class struggle fuck the bourgie and capitalism and well sort out our stupidity in a safe environment where capitalism cant undo the progress of ending bigotry and racism
socialism,not_removed,nice to see you here comrade
socialism,not_removed,its stupid and typically just a strategic way to avoid dealing with the fact that many socalled socialists actually dont even agree with the notion that class is a fundamental origin of oppression and material hierarchy you think people would understand this by now im a queer woman who is constantly getting into fights about socialist feminism on leftypol and i get called a brocialist all of the time i really hope you dont get banned for what youve said in this thread
socialism,not_removed,thats a wild comparison if we are talking about socialists not capitalist apologists for white cisgendered socialists even the slightest disagreement of issues to do with pocfeminist issues can label you a brocialist i just wonder if this same sort of labelling happens towards non white cisgendered allies
socialism,not_removed,mostly marxist leninists theres more anarchists and generic marxists than marxistleninists and most of the marxists take a more libertarian position than any ml would mls and mlms arent viewed very kindly on leftypol so much so that they created marx to separate i see leftypol not as explicitly sexist or at all racist but they mostly just kneejerk too hard against feminism they mostly meaning aside from pol crossposters and traditionalvalues tankies sympathise with lgbtqissues
socialism,not_removed,arent like the higher numbered chans worse
socialism,not_removed,i dislike dank memes i prefer zesty memes
socialism,not_removed,but theyre not neccesarily leftypol is by some users being accused of racism and sexism a larger number in this thread however think they exhibit signs of neither i think it is irresponsible to veto against even positively mentioning a leftist forum which we cannot conclusively regard sexist or racist
socialism,not_removed,its more than responsible its your duty if you dont do it i shall be very disappointed in you and start a permanent revolution to destroy burgeois scum like you
socialism,not_removed,pay gap as someone who has apparently swallowed the liberal perspective big time on this one could you maybe help me out on understanding this this is rsocialism so the solution is obvious but not the one i think some people have in mind even among reactionaries ive only ever heard not that the wage gap is made up but that its a problem of women and men working different hours at different jobs is this a lie what is the problem and what is the solution from a feminist perspective from a well‐meaning latterly leftist guy who used to explain this one to my sister a lot
socialism,not_removed,are you or are you not defending the use of racial slurs
socialism,not_removed,cheers mostly been lurking in the past
socialism,not_removed,i dont quite agree ive seen as much calls for brocialism as cries to not throw it out so freely it seems hotly contested not one sided and it definitely depends on the forum in focus
socialism,not_removed,uh the ones who arent fascists who pretty much exclusively come from pol to antagonize whats left of that poor board arent hiding anything and are actually some of the most knowledgeable and familiar leftists ive ever encountered on the internet which admittedly is a fucking low bar they just have an absurdly immature and extreme reaction to idpol theyll betray the revolution because they dont like tumblr politics so that somehow makes them indecipherable from reactionary altright morons no and regardless that still doesnt make them liberals plain and simple
socialism,not_removed,no theyre spooked by bourgeoisie feminism its very reactionary of them so socialists shouldnt oppose bourgeoise feminism
socialism,not_removed,i bet if you told them to google strasserism half of them would highfive each other and declare that as their platform bullshit theres been threads about strasserism before and most of the board opposes any kind of nationalism vehemently
socialism,not_removed,they heavily remind me of the modern communist party of russia or the national bolsheviks
socialism,not_removed,the whole reason why got popular is because people got upset at censorship on over gamer gate i have a hard time seeing anything about gg would censor but thats where got its user base
socialism,not_removed,i like is a tire fire meant for tia types
socialism,not_removed,no clue i just know and
socialism,not_removed,ive visited leftypol many times and ive never seen a case of racism or sexism other than polyps trying to bait a reaction
socialism,not_removed,because its infinitely more nuanced than what this description of the board would ever let on yes they use appalling language and yes i have been the target of numerous misogynistic attacks and comments but by and large the language is hollow and typically used in service of an overwhelmingly egalitarian and sensible socialist argument reducing it to racist unacceptable ban worthy trash vs pure acceptable leftism is intentionally missing the point and just falling back on binary descriptions
socialism,not_removed,i think it is irresponsible to veto against even positively mentioning a leftist forum which we cannot conclusively regard sexist or racist we cant conclusively regard it because people think that ironic use of the racist slurs is completely okay because its a chanboard its not that we cant conclusively regard it as x or y its that some dont want to if it was vague then id get your point but if people explicitly use racist slurs and explicitly engage in the same style of racism as polthen defending leftypol is just apologia for neonazism wrapped in leftist language
socialism,not_removed,a larger number in this thread however think they exhibit signs of neither the difference being that these people are wrong if you have a forum which gives platforms to racism and sexism you are a racist and sexist forum if we were discussing stormfront and a bunch of nazis came in here and said it wasnt a racist forum theyd still be nazis and stormfront would still be garbage edit spelling
socialism,not_removed,i can help explain this in a bit its sort of essentially semantics but it apparently makes a world of difference to some people essentially it comes down to the marxian conclusion that wages are determined based off of how little the employer can pay ie exploit the worker while ensuring they continue to reproduce their labor power regardless of gender but the pay gap takes place upon gendered lines because both men and women now exist in the workplace and sexist assumptions and ideas pervade notions not only about how much women actually need in terms of income to survive as theyre assumed to have husbands who also work but also in terms of how valuable womens labor is
socialism,not_removed,theyre racial slurs i never said they werent theyre part and parcel of the chan vernacular which clearly has its overwhelming complete origin in straight up bigotry as is a derivative of the massively racist and pol and if you voluntarily use leftypol theyre an inescapable part of the landscape so dont use leftypol almost nobody does i dont use them and i obviously dont condone them but youll ban me regardless of what i say here i see
socialism,not_removed,also child porn dont forget that
socialism,not_removed,theyre part and parcel of the chan vernacular ive never been called a nr by anyone on before
socialism,not_removed,why would you assume im going to ban you its my job to make sure positions on ambiguous topics are clarified so people dont come to a misunderstanding
socialism,not_removed,rsocialism isnt exactly known for a ban policy thats particularly friendly to ambiguity also any defense of leftypol will be banned on sight is pretty explicit
socialism,not_removed,rsocialism isnt exactly known for a ban policy thats particularly friendly to ambiguity with good reason every time we let someone go on the basis of ambiguity they usually say something stupid within a few hours if not days that would result in an immediate ban regardless its better to just ban people and have them justify their positionsprove their not shit over modmail also any defense of leftypol will be banned on sight is pretty explicit yes because leftypol is a shithole full of garbage human beings who think racial slurs are funny i asked for clarification on your comment because i had to be sure whether or not you were defending it im still digesting that information
socialism,not_removed,who think racial slurs are funny using slurs ironically or otherwise cant be funny
socialism,not_removed,if youre years old and just found out what it meant maybe
socialism,not_removed,demsoc is a reformist branch of socialism meaning they seek to usher in socialism through reforms within the capitalist system socdems do not seek to end capitalism or abolish the exploitation of the working class they mean to put a nicerfriendlier face to capitalism so that the downtrodden wont have as horrible of an existence but they dont want to take measure to end the oppression of the proletariat
socialism,not_removed,thank you
socialism,not_removed,this is incorrect we need to be extremely careful with our terms democratic socialism is a catchall name used to describe a variety of ideas distinguished from the kind of socialism they saw developing in the ussr undemocratic socialism or state socialism it explicitly rejects both capitalism and stalinism seeking to create a society based upon the democratic ownership and control of productive forces by the workingclass democratic socialists are not reformists those who believe socialism can be created by reforming capitalism through the capitalist state they believe that ultimately the workers will need to formalise their control over society in a revolution examples of democratic socialists include the early labour party in the uk trotskys fourth international council communists and so forth social democracy is a form of capitalist regime where workers are given some measure of formal social power usually in the form of nationalised industries encompassing public services trade unions being given a formal role in the political process etc but in which capitalist interests still predominate and dictate society bernie sanders as much as i respect and admire the bloke falls much more into this category than the former his political revolution is not a socialist transformation of society merely a rebalancing of power between workers and capitalists within the terms of capital accumulation socialdemocratic societies have been shown to be somewhat fleeting contingent on specific social conditions and vulnerable to reactionary forces the postwar social contract in the uk guttering after the opec crisis and ultimately leading to thatcher is an archetypical example to recap demsocs are anticapitalist antistalinist revolutionaries socdems are procapitalist reformists who believe common ground can be found between employers and workers
socialism,not_removed,engels wrote about democratic socialism was the term revised these democratic socialists are either proletarians who are not yet sufficiently clear about the conditions of the liberation of their class or they are representatives of the petty bourgeoisie a class which prior to the achievement of democracy and the socialist measures to which it gives rise has many interests in common with the proletariat
socialism,not_removed,terms will always evolve and change i dont think we can necessarily import our definitions wholesale from marx and engels in principles of communism hes clearly talking about reformists a term which we already have in the specific context of the prelude to the revolutions using democratic socialist to refer exclusively to reformists in the soviet and postsoviet era denies us a handy way beginning to disentangle marxs ideas from stalinism
socialism,not_removed,he distinguishes between reformists which can be defined as todays socdems and engels calls the bourgeois socialists and democratic socialists the reformists to this end some propose mere welfare measures – while others come forward with grandiose systems of reform which under the pretense of reorganizing society are in fact intended to preserve the foundations and hence the life of existing society communists must unremittingly struggle against these bourgeois socialists because they work for the enemies of communists and protect the society which communists aim to overthrow and the democratic socialists these democratic socialists are either proletarians who are not yet sufficiently clear about the conditions of the liberation of their class or they are representatives of the petty bourgeoisie a class which prior to the achievement of democracy and the socialist measures to which it gives rise has many interests in common with the proletariat it follows that in moments of action the communists will have to come to an understanding with these democratic socialists and in general to follow as far as possible a common policy with them – provided that these socialists do not enter into the service of the ruling bourgeoisie and attack the communists it is clear that this form of cooperation in action does not exclude the discussion of differences communists will have to learn to cooperate with demsoc and demsoc will have to get over the big other that is joseph stalin if we truly want to bring proletarian revolution about and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat i am one who believes that our contradictions are not antagonistic so im pretty optimistic about our eventual cooperation
socialism,not_removed,i dunno thinking stalin was aight is a pretty big other or is that big brother to get over
socialism,not_removed,its fully automated luxury communism common ownership of the automatons and everything for everyone
socialism,not_removed,workers control is not socialism workers control is the means to socialism a classless society necessitates a lack of class including the working class class only distinguishes between different relationships to the means of production if everyone has the same relationship that is classlessness no group who owns but does not work no group who works but does not own thats not out of line with a society in which nobody works thanks to automation
socialism,not_removed,the owners of the modes of production dont need to be the workers they could be a collective of shareholder
socialism,not_removed,i suggest you attempt to learn more about socialism and economics before bringing up your suggestions here
socialism,not_removed,socialism is the collective ownership of the moded of production but this ownership can take many forms as such socialism has many subordinate economic and political systems
socialism,not_removed,its not that we think socialist tendencies that dont focus on the working class dont exist its just that we think theyre wrong
socialism,not_removed,im in psl i have had little problems are you near any branch
socialism,not_removed,psl member here some have reported issues in the past with regards to the online form but this is uncommon aside from resending your query which also helps what i strongly recommend is simply calling the branch nearest to you that should put you through right away please feel free to message me and i will do my best to get a nearby branch in contact with you
socialism,not_removed,hi im also in the process of joining i dont live in a city or even a state with an active branch and was replied to in two weeks
socialism,not_removed,like hour depends on if youre near a branch
socialism,not_removed,quick question what does psl stand for im looking around at socialist parties trying to decide one
socialism,not_removed,i am albuquerque
socialism,not_removed,ill see if i can contact psl albuquerque ill get back to you if i have problems
socialism,not_removed,httpswwwpslweborg
socialism,not_removed,try going to this on the once there tell comrades that youre interested in joining the party
socialism,not_removed,thanks
socialism,not_removed,anytime comrade
socialism,not_removed,im reading the exact book from the thumbnail panther vision im only halfway through but so far its a fantastic collection of political theory and revolutionary strategy
socialism,not_removed,awesome i was looking into getting that you should check out his other book defying the tomb too it seems good
socialism,not_removed,this video is a gross oversimplication of the situation blaming socialism says you have little to no understanding of my country at least read up on venezuelas economic and political history and think about what it means to be a mono producing oil dependent country with the biggest reserves on the planet the worst part of this video is that it exploits the suffering of poor venezuelans to push capitalist propaganda when capitalism is what landed us in this situation in the first place shame on you edit came back to say that if the oas achieves its goal of clearing a path for multinationals to profit off venezuelan oil a huge amount of it is underneath the amazon by the orinoco river wonder if youll still be into capitalism after it destroys the most diverse biome on earth
socialism,not_removed,is it suprising that the west is wealthy when they have stolen from all the other nations
socialism,not_removed,there has to exist a happiest country no matter what and since socialism can only exist internationally the happiest country must be a capitalist one
socialism,not_removed,while denmarks economy is still capitalist it still has many social safety nets that keep people from being completely homeless and poor anyone thats been there immediately notes the almost complete lack of homeless people happiness isnt always connected to how well a country is doing economically denmark also has one of the lowest obesity rates in the world due to health awareness and widespread bicycle usage they also have socialized medicine so there is virtually no fear of getting checked up and healthier people happier people denmark takes care of their citizens way better than most countries do in large part to socialist policies
socialism,not_removed,is it really the happiest country isnt their largest party a farright party a happy country doesnt elect the farright
socialism,not_removed,depends on how happiness is quantified
socialism,not_removed,isnt denmark a socialist country
socialism,not_removed,no country is socialist but denmark is one thats one of the closest
socialism,not_removed,social democratic policies
socialism,not_removed,right wing in denmark isnt full on laissezfaire whacko like it is in the us its antiimmigrant nationalist
socialism,not_removed,no
socialism,not_removed,why is this downvoted guys denmark is a centerleft liberal democracy with a few httpsenwikipediaorgwikisocialdemocracy policies edited for accuracy
socialism,not_removed,its not a matter of close or far suggesting that it is only confuses the matter socialism is the abolition of the definitive characteristics of capitalism wage labor production for commodity exchange markets the state etc the most glaring contradiction in saying that a country is close to socialist is that the abolition of the state is in direct conflict with the existence of the country to begin with
socialism,not_removed,not really the federation of northern syriarojava is by far the closest thing to socialism on a large scale that the world currently has
socialism,not_removed,socialism is not a spectrum
socialism,not_removed,i think youre on the wrong subreddit if you think some people are better at imperialism thatn others friend
socialism,not_removed,right and surely a happy country would have no need to scapegoat immigrants for whatever problems theyre being blamed for
socialism,not_removed,i dont know much about socialism yet just started exploring today i actually just googled socialist countries out of curiosity and denmark is second on the list
socialism,not_removed,socdem is an attempt to blend socialist and capitalist ideas its a failure overall but its certainly better than laissezfaire ideas
socialism,not_removed,communism is a totality that is only known through the complete negation of capitalism
socialism,not_removed,definitely inaccurate capitalists control the factories and businesses over there and reap the rewards not the workers
socialism,not_removed,do you have any questions is there anything youd like to learn about socialism
socialism,not_removed,this is wonderful i hope youll stick around quick explanation if i can help denmark and the other nordics as well as much of northern europe canada somewhat etc is a social democracy in which the harshest edges of capitalism are smoothed out with a strong social safety net in socialism though workers own and democratically manage their workplaces there can still be a social safety net but capitalismwhere some people make money by owning land or business while the masses are workers who must sell their laboris abolished
socialism,not_removed,definitely check out the socialist starter pack in the sidebar its full of accessible content like youtube videos and documentaries as well as books highly recommended
socialism,not_removed,im not talking about what it is in practice im talking about what it is definitionally the point was to make it clear that its not socialism
socialism,not_removed,better than laissez faire sure but social democratic policies have nothing to do with socialism they dont provide workers autonomy theyre kickbacks from the bourgeoisie meted out at their pleasure
socialism,not_removed,no i know exactly what im thinking of democratic socialism is a wide array of socialist currents that put an emphasis on democracy and stress its role in a socialist movement they are sometimes used as synonyms but they are definitely different things social democracy is a movement that advocates for the establishment of socialism through existing capitalist political structures httpsenwikipediaorgwikieduardbernstein one of the earliest and most important social democrats held this exact position to even call denmark social democratic is a bit of a misnomer ill admit more accurately its a typical centerleft liberal democracy with social democratic elements and policies
socialism,not_removed,the origin and character of social democracy comes from theorists and movements that predate lenin and the bolsheviks read the article on social democracy on wikipedia and the article i linked above
socialism,not_removed,why dont anticapitalists drink tea because proper tea is theft
socialism,not_removed,a grim one from the eastern bloc q what socialism couldnt do in years and capitalism managed to do in years a make socialism look good
socialism,not_removed,i hate communists theyre so classless
socialism,not_removed,you could say these jokes are priceless
socialism,not_removed,honestly the behaviour here raises a huge red flag
socialism,not_removed,what do you get when you put socialists alone in a closet splitter groups
socialism,not_removed,required watching
socialism,not_removed,what happens if you let a trotskyite alone for minutes they figure out how to create splitter groups out of atoms
socialism,not_removed,its why all true socialists drink rooibos tea
socialism,not_removed,how many socialists does it take to change a lightbulb two one to change the lightbulb and one to say that the other is doing it undialectically and shoot him to protect the revolution
socialism,not_removed,and yet one could say they still had value
socialism,not_removed,i cant go through the day without cups of english breakfast guess im just a bourgie
socialism,not_removed,how many liberals does it take to change a lightbulb none liberals cant change anything
socialism,not_removed,quantum dialectical mechanics explains this well
socialism,not_removed,english breakfast imperialist
socialism,not_removed,socialism is not wealth redistribution through taxes it is an entirely new way of producing commodities with the aim of preventing gross capital accumulation from occurring in the first place making stateenforced wealth redistribution unnecessary
socialism,not_removed,how does this associate to socialism
socialism,not_removed,well as it is every government of whichever strand is failing to do the one thing that is essential to redistribution greece even went bankrupt due to it
socialism,not_removed,this still doesnt explain how this is relevant to or associated to socialism
socialism,not_removed,knights protect us i am pretty sure that is only what we think of them when we look back actual peasants in that time knew well that knights were bullies for the aristocracy more than anything
socialism,not_removed,akab
socialism,not_removed,all
socialism,not_removed,police are pigs
socialism,not_removed,this rhetoric aids noone cops in many cases are just as subverted as the allegorical citizen they sign up in the belief they are aiding communities protecting people rather than enforcing twisted capitalistic justice there may not be good cops for all cops partake in the enforcement of a oppressive system yet there are good people who become cops we should not seek to generalise so widely a huge group of people alienating those who could be allies against their reactionary colleagues
socialism,not_removed,police will be shown no sympathy when the time comes they will meet the same fate of the fascists and bourgeoisie
socialism,not_removed,this isnt how knights operated they were basically just land owners who promised their swords to the lord and allowed fueledlikeslaves to farm knights were never the equivalent of police a better analogy for what you want to express would by the samurai who acted as basically bodyguards and policemen for the rich people who could afford them
socialism,not_removed,they didnt even have the role of fucking peace keepers this wasnt their task this wasnt their job no one expected them to do it not even on paper they were soldiers and land holders
socialism,not_removed,knights
socialism,not_removed,cops
socialism,not_removed,alienating those who could be allies against their reactionary colleagues do i try to pitch the end of their occupation social status and salary between the clubbings or after the clubbings
socialism,not_removed,you can recognize that its the institution thats oppressive moreso than anyone participating in it individually and still recognize that when push comes to shove these good people will crack your skull if you step out of line
socialism,not_removed,acab is more meant for pointing out the systemic injustices you pointed out its like saying black people cant be racist that is to say there is more to it then you might first think
socialism,not_removed,i miss r leftwithasharpedge
socialism,not_removed,so edgy
socialism,not_removed,doth be bastards
socialism,not_removed,aye because no police have ever defected during revolutions remember it was the national guard who prompted the establishment of the paris commune despite having been formed purely to protect bourgeoisie property interests in much of southern england i would believe the police to hold much greater revolutionary conscience than the working classes an admittedly unfortunate state primarily due to the lack of conscience amongst the latter but the current state nonetheless perhaps more relevant to this particular americentric post would be the number of whistleblowers emerging from the ranks of us police departments are their former colleagues behind the blue wall of silence bastards yes are these whistleblowers many of whom came forward with no intention to give up their gun or badge bastards even if their intentions remain to serve and protect the people whatever the practicality of the situation
socialism,not_removed,i dont believe simply stating black people cant be racist is helpful either if youre gonna say it you have to explain it in this case acab alienates potential socialists and has no explained basis to stand upon
socialism,not_removed,dae everything that isnt ultra mundane is edgy
socialism,not_removed,bastards
socialism,not_removed,if they arent leaving the institution and speaking out against its abuses theyre bastards
socialism,not_removed,certainly it needs to be explained but i dont think the phrases should be changed because of this sorry if ive misunderstood something
socialism,not_removed,nothing utopic about the immortal science of marxismleninism
socialism,not_removed,i feel that this is more of a pedantic argument rather than a substantial one we can compare what previous demsocs believed to what previous socdems believed and we can compare what those terms mean today but this rabbit hole goes deeper what is reformist what is revolutionary these are the questions that tore apart the left in america and around the world do we need a vanguard is anything less than straightup leninism actually just reformist where do we draw the line i primarily associate myself with the writings of eugene debs who called himself a socialist and advocated for what he called social democracy which is usually what people today call democratic socialism industrial selfgovernment social democracy will completely revolutionize the community life for the first time in history the people will be truly free and rule themselves and when this comes to pass poverty will vanish like mist before the sunrise he viewed the democratic structure of the usa as a tool to be used by the socialist party to further their message we should seek only to register the actual vote of socialism no more no less in our propaganda we should state our principles clearly speak the truth fearlessly seeking neither to flatter nor to offend but only to convince those who should be with us and win them to our cause through an intelligent understanding of its mission he saw the elections as a great time to get the word out to give speeches and raise awareness and solidarity does this make him a reformer because he wanted to use the existing system to his partys advantage or does it make him a revolutionary because he wanted to abuse the system to his partys advantage with the goal of eventually doing away with the system today of course the term means something different i usually associate demsocs like myself with those who want to use democracy to reformreplace capitalism democratic socialism standing in contrast to democratic capitalism if you will i think that any socialist has the duty and responsibility to make the lives of the working class better in any way they can the best way to do this would be to work towards the end of capitalism but if all you can do is ensure that the worst excesses of capitalism are reigned in then you have a responsibility to do so i suppose that wanting to better the lives of the working class makes me a reformer true revolutionaries would let them suffer in order to build more revolutionary sentiment i suppose its a failing of mine
socialism,not_removed,ive read elsewhere that it merely just means having a socialist society that is governed by a democratic political system ideally direct i think the problem with that definition is that its really vague and marxists already tend to describe themselves based upon what specific type of democratic political system they support i mean most mls will tell you that marxismleninism is democratic im not a linguistic prescriptivist or anything if people understand democratic socialism to mean that then its a legitimate definition its just not a useful one so i dont think we should encourage it as for social democracy its conflated with democratic socialism because whatever their intentions in practice they do the same thing ive never heard of a democratic socialist party proposing a bill or referendum that says end capitalism they just try to pass the same reforms socdems do i dont see the usefulness of democratic socialism as a term at all
socialism,not_removed,i think you stated it perfectly it is used for both a socialist system within a political democracy and reformismparliamentary means to socialism basically so no it doesnt necessarily mean reformism but id say thats the dominate strain the main purpose of the term was to seperate from marxismleninism states and other variations and to stress the need for political democracy as for the social dems yes it is used for a welfare state kind of capitalism now it didnt originate that way like you said but it is only rarely used in the original sense of the term now and people that would have considered themselves social dems in the original sense would probably fall under democratic socialism now
socialism,not_removed,why cant we have a democratic revolution it seems that if we build a mass movement we could seize control of the government in one or two election cycles and then use state power to institute socialism in fact this seems to me like the only possible way to achieve socialism the state has achieved unprecedented power challenging the state seems to me like an insane strategy the correct approach i think would be to take over the state through a mass democratic revolution and then institute socialism not through a series of gradual reforms but by amending the constitution to ban private property and wage labor and proceeding to nationalize all industry
socialism,not_removed,is democratic socialism necessarily reformism objectively yes
socialism,not_removed,good post i think i see myself similarly im not a reformist in the sense that we can vote in socialism actually im not sure anyone actually believes that come to think of it but i still believe pushing a political platform based on socializing finance healthcare and other industries pushing for worker cooperatives similar to what richard wolff advocates are how you build support for any kind of proletariat revolution the limitations of liberal democracy as a vehicle for socialism should be plainly obvious to anyone on this sub but there are still merits to trying to use it to promote ideas and building movements as well as short term socdem relief to improving the lives of the working class
socialism,not_removed,i suppose that wanting to better the lives of the working class makes me a reformer true revolutionaries would let them suffer in order to build more revolutionary sentiment i suppose its a failing of mine you clearly are misunderstood revolutionaries accept reform as a way to ease workers lives and sit in parliaments to use as a tribune for their message the difference is that revoutionaries realize that at some point violence will be necessary since the bourgeoisie will use violence to defend its interests letting the working class suffer to build more revolutionary sentiment is called accelerationism and its a big nono among revolutionary circles
socialism,not_removed,im sure you already know this but theres no such thing as democratic capitalism
socialism,not_removed,so objectively no
socialism,not_removed,naw
socialism,not_removed,schumer did lose family in the holocaust ill give him a pass this one time
socialism,not_removed,the democrats would be terribly ineffective allies anyway
socialism,not_removed,liberals are now suddenly condemning drone strikes seriously fuck them only when tragedies are giving them a slight uplift for their own agenda they fake empathy
socialism,not_removed,this really schumer is a corporate neolib but its not at all hard to believe he has strong feelings about this
socialism,not_removed,how do you propose a serious socialist awakening in this country without them
socialism,not_removed,really i mean you have constant diplomatic trade and cultural contact with europe and particularly britain and theyve still not managed to make the idea of healthcare provisionexisting even slightly palatable to the us public who will literally die of sepsis or bankrupt themselves over penicillin before they accept anything socialist i dont think you could do any worse without them conversely speaking the black bloc have gotten a fair chunk of reasonably positive press almost directly as a consequence of trumps election im not an accelerationist as such but it does look a lot like the best thing to happen to socialism in the us is a fascist
socialism,not_removed,im not an accelerationist as such but it does look a lot like the best thing to happen to socialism in the us is a fascist this is an interesting idea were observing maybe we could reframe it though like the rise of neofascists is yet another crisis of capitalism in decay so really late stage capitalism is a great window of opportunity for socialism in the us
socialism,not_removed,that would probably be a better internal descriptor of the phenomenon but looking from outside the us you have a probably fairly time limited window to reframe the word socialism as something that wont cause people to switch their brains off to regurgitate propaganda in bernies done some of the work chomsky is someone thats at least got some presence even if only for the educated the message doesnt need to be any more complex than trump is a fascist white nationalists are fascists socialists are antifascist antifascists punched richard spencer even that might be too cumbersome
socialism,not_removed,thanks something pithy is what we need also i really appreciate your evaluation of our position in the us many of us americans here are looking for evaluations and strategies at present
socialism,not_removed,its funny looking back because as a liberal i was a firm opponent of capital punishment now as a socialist ive changed my mind i think its necessary to have capital punishment as a deterrent for the worst sort of crimes especially the crimes of powerful people who were entrusted with responsibilities byto the people and who abused those responsibilities the guillotine is harsh but it also represents powerful leverage for the people against elites maybe in a future where capital and capitalists have lost their power over us it will be possible to do away with capital punishment but as of now jail is not much of a deterrent if you have tons of capital reserves that can be used to either make the jail term a luxury stay or overturn the conviction
socialism,not_removed,capital punishment is powerful tool in the oppression of classes and as such the proletarian state should use it as a tool for the oppression of the bourgeoise and their counterrevolutionary resistance capital punishment brought against proletarians for noncounter revolutionary crimes is another can of worms entirely
socialism,not_removed,history teacher what did you expect
socialism,not_removed,id support capital punishment for public servants abusing their power and ive always considered myself anticapital punishment in general
socialism,not_removed,i would say there is a huge difference between capital punishment for criminals vs revolutionary violent revolution optional targets if a bourgeois prick opts to fund counter revolutionary forces then confiscation of their resources makes sense to stop them regardless of what must be done to them to do so capital punishment or otherwise it becomes a case of eggs for omelettes basically treat a terrorist like a terrorist
socialism,not_removed,i tried to say this further up you said this much more elegantly
socialism,not_removed,p
socialism,not_removed,los angeles comrades ours is on dec in brentwood check out rcaliforniasocialists for more details and events in our state
socialism,not_removed,so i was born into a jewish family but now im a radical marxistleninistfeminist and i despise bannon more than i wouldve if i were still jewish my ramblings just go to show you that socialism is pretty awesome
socialism,not_removed,youre very brave for posting this is in rjudaism i guess i wasnt surprised that a lot of people there were tacit if not outright trump supporters its still very sad to see fellow tribe members support fascism and ive stopped visiting i have a theory that jewish spaces on the internet skew heavily orthodox who in turn skew conservative politically if you ever read comments on jewish news sites like the forward youll be pretty disgusted of course it doesnt help that mainstream judaism is all spineless libs
socialism,not_removed,nah judging from the sounds of things they want too move towards a similar model that nazi germany had
socialism,not_removed,there is a tractor trailer in lake county florida with trump painted on it right next to a steam engine
socialism,not_removed,you dont consider yourself jewish anymore can i ask why not
socialism,not_removed,rjudaism leans hella orthodox rightwing and urber zionist so i wasnt too surprised at the selfhaters who will wilingly back an antisemite just so long as it might be in israels interest but obviously there is not total unanimity there if for no other reason than it clearly was upvoted a fair amount
socialism,not_removed,judaism is impossible to actually believe for me plus its megahateful i cannot get behind any theology which preaches that a naked jewish man and his rib got the entire human population cursed forever by interacting with a talking snake i had to leave judaism if i ever wanted to examine reality from a valid point of view
socialism,not_removed,i just dropped a massive rant there about how i hate israel because im a masochist let the fun begin
socialism,not_removed,so then he turned around and voted for nixon howd that work out for trust in government
socialism,not_removed,good luck with that your post seems well phrased and even handed maybe youll get some thoughtful responses but my guess is that youll get a bunch of canned arguments as usual
socialism,not_removed,some people in the south think nixon was framed by the dnc the commies or both
socialism,not_removed,the mods found my comment above and accused me of trolling which is somewhat fair but at the end of the day i have serious problems in reconciling israel with my jewish identity all i got were boring point by point refutations nothing compelling
socialism,not_removed,oh an old southern asshole thats different probably voted for george wallace
socialism,not_removed,come join us in risraelpalestine would you like to do an ama
socialism,not_removed,maybe kinda looks like a shitshow over there
socialism,not_removed,different leftists
socialism,not_removed,this sounds absurd even my communist hating grandma knows enough to say that trump isnt a communist the writer vaguely mentions that white liberals have compared trump to a communist but wheres the proof for this outside of the general contempt for liberals
socialism,not_removed,who exactly downvotes this could you at least explain why
socialism,not_removed,capitalists seek to increase profits regardless of its social usefullness workers seek to increase production of socially useful products efficiency can mean anything you want
socialism,not_removed,well there are a few bigger things to take into account here the first and largest is that workers naturally are closer to the end product than are capitalists because of the fact that theyre the ones building it think about it who actually handles supply chain under our system the vast majority of the time for any decent sized enterprise the ceo or board of directors will step nowhere near its daytoday operations supply chains and distribution will still be necessary under socialism of course and these positions will still be open the primary cancer of capitalism is the fact that the executives make us think that we need them the executives do little but sign off on decisions and own property it is the labor power both the physical productive aspect and the mental distributive aspect which makes up the sum of all goods the exact nature of this depends upon which variation of socialism for example an anarchosyndicalist society would likely have a managerial union for any given industry or in a modern transitional ml society it may be handled by a cybersynesque bottomup system or any combination thereof or anything really theres not much telling the second is that socialism doesnt really espouse efficiency of production in terms as we know it efficiency under the capitalist system and under bourgeois definition means the amount of output relative to the amount of labor such that a more efficient system is one which produces more output with less input socialism claims other efficiencies such as environmental efficiency and efficiency over timedegradationresistant goods which otherwise would be subject to cheap production and thus poor quality its pretty common knowledge that when it comes to efficiency of production capitalism is necessary to create the material conditions of efficient production necessary for socialism and is thus the best for efficiencyproduction simply because of the way the profit motive drives production to generate as much surplus labour as possible where capitalism sacrifices humanity in the name of efficiency socialism strives for efficiency but will unabashedly put humanity before it in some ways this actually increases efficiency by certain metrics for example in societies where the workers had relative control production has been seen to go up and lets not forget the massive strides made by the ml states of the century whether you think they were socialist or not isnt a debate to bother with here whats important is that their planned economies produced massive industrialization and sociotechnological progress in a very small amount of time the third and final metric by which you could mean efficiency is how socialism aims to produce for the good of mankind and humanity rather than profit the capitalist system produces for profit and fails to take into account things such as the environment this is not an issue with socialism socialism would aim to produce a given thing as little as possible and have it be as well made as possible so in an environmentalproductive sense socialism is more efficient
socialism,not_removed,what do you mean efficiency what we want is effectiveness not efficiency with a human cost we arent looking to raise the gdp or grow the economy with worker owned workplaces what we desperately need is a sustainable society that minimizes the impact of human activity on our planet resources managed by all citizens is much more effective at meet their needs than having a few oligarchs plan the economy if you have more questions you can always visit
socialism,not_removed,morning star light bringer lucifer literally satan didnt read the article sorry but this is too easy a jab
socialism,not_removed,could anybody recommend a good piece on the relationship between marxist thought and transgender people im trying to learn more something about the issue
socialism,not_removed,you say that like being literally satan is a bad thing
socialism,not_removed,these articles touch on the issue quite a bit
socialism,not_removed,check out httpsenwikipediaorgwikilesliefeinbergs works theres also a few good thread over at rcommunism if you do a search for transgender there
socialism,not_removed,thanks
socialism,not_removed,america a nation where we love freedom of speech until it goes against the countries traditions
socialism,not_removed,its such a sad and outrageous thing that one person exercising some kind of autonomy and chosing not to stand ritually on command makes that big of an issue to a lot of people like bill hicks said in america youre free to do as we tell you
socialism,not_removed,something thats killing me about the outrage is people are pissed because hes not personally oppressed and is talking about this stuff which is totally backwards thats an incredible thing to me he could have just kept raking in the money signing autographs etc he didnt have to put a target on his back from the entire country but he did because he is in solidarity with oppressed black people
socialism,not_removed,good for him this is admirable as a fat guy i love the concept of sitting for what you believe in
socialism,not_removed,just a follow up to the post from a couple of days ago appears that colin will still protest the anthem and will not yield to the demands of patriotic americans
socialism,not_removed,wasnt it refreshing to see how other countries treat their flag casually during the olympics writing on it etc here in the us people threaten you with violence if you do that i hope kaepernick keeps it up and others follow because this insane behavior we encourage is toxic
socialism,not_removed,other teammates like many in the public were and are bothered especially since not standing for the national anthem seems like a swipe at military servicemen and service women who sacrificed so kaepernick could freely decide to do what he wants like protest
socialism,not_removed,nationalism has a way of oppressing others noam chomsky
socialism,not_removed,i was in kansas city the other weekend when my twins played there and during the anthem we were still finding our way to our seats i noticed that literally everyone i could see in the concourses stopped what they were doing took off their hats and put them over their hearts in reverence i suppose even the people standing in line about to get food it creeped me the fuck out me and my dad just kept walking and i just know a bunch of them were thinking wow those minnesotans are so disrespectful we were wearing twins gear it reeks of a sort of mob mentality many americans truly believe that you have to take every opportunity to honor the flag and the anthem and that if you dont do this you are being unpatriotic the rest are so afraid of being labeled as unpatriotic that they fall in line so that you cant tell these groups apart there seems to be some sentiment on reddit regarding this story that if you arent personally and materially massively affected by some issue you cant protest on behalf of the people you feel connected to thats such bullshit so zero men should have been pushing for giving women the vote zero white people should have been abolitionists zero rich people should push for income equality basically patriotism is not the same as nationalism and i see way too much of the latter
socialism,not_removed,do americans generally hold this tradition to such high esteem this blind nationalism to me appears pretty dystopian and cult like
socialism,not_removed,are many americans actually indignant when something like this happens or does he get a lot of support from people around you or from people in the media or on social media i hope some americans actually like seeing stand up or not in the way hes doing or am i too optimistic
socialism,not_removed,ill continue to sit during national anthem me too only i also refuse to play or even watch your patriotic violent commercial wargame pretty sure youre still on shaky ground there and shouldnt be applauded too heavily
socialism,not_removed,muh flag
socialism,not_removed,the thing about this is that yes americans are absurdly nationalistic but what pisses me off is that this becomes a major story while at the same time the entire united states handling of syria has completely went off the rails over the past week sure lets all get pissed off that some millionaire didnt salute the flag during the national anthem but people dying directly because of our awful foreign policy thats just another day living in america the priorities of your average citizen are so far out of whack its ridiculous
socialism,not_removed,true its very ridiculous
socialism,not_removed,its funny that people bitch about government constantly most people dont even vote yet this at times i wonder how many people actually care and is out the media focusing on few to give the appearance of outrage
socialism,not_removed,and just because hes financially successful doesnt make him magically immune to oppression
socialism,not_removed,i said this in my comment above before seeing yours there seems to be some sentiment on reddit regarding this story that if you arent massively personally and materially affected by some issue you cant protest on behalf of the people you feel connected to thats such bullshit so zero men should have been pushing for giving women the vote zero white people should have been abolitionists zero rich people should push for income equality i totally agree
socialism,not_removed,yeah how come all these white people care about oppressed minorities
socialism,not_removed,ha
socialism,not_removed,thats basically what the occupy movement did or are doing are they still around
socialism,not_removed,i never understood how protesting in a civil or uncivil manner could be considered unamerican and a disgrace to our founding fathers yet every time it happens
socialism,not_removed,yeah i laughed about how ridiculous were some of the american traditions anthem with all the respect and that shit and i was threatened you use your flag for underwear for fucks sake
socialism,not_removed,hahaha its hilarious they cant figure out how contradictory that is they literally prove his right to do it but somehow think it proves their right to be mad at it
socialism,not_removed,so you cant do what you want becuase you are free to do what you want ive never understood that logic
socialism,not_removed,that whole article was the thickest and most transparent sheen of ideology over a topic the writer finds bothersome that ive ever seen in sports journalism
socialism,not_removed,for using the rights we defend so strongly to not sing a song and not practice a quasireligious ritual you find distasteful were going to say you must hate our countrys core values
socialism,not_removed,thats the point it creates a fictional identity that must be shared by all because we say so
socialism,not_removed,it is dystopian and cult like and yes they do hold it in this high of esteem
socialism,not_removed,yeah in school were forced to stand up place out hand on our heart and recite the pledge of allegiance every morning this starts at around years old before were old enough to question it
socialism,not_removed,yep americans are this nationalistic about every american tradition the minute anyone especially a person of color deviates from that norm it causes some widespread outrage youd think these scandals would open up some critical dialogue about politics but it ends up being drowned out by the endless cries of but the troops and if you dont like it leave
socialism,not_removed,my guess is that on social media and among the general public there will be a good deal of support at least youre probably being too optimistic if youre talking about american sports culture and fandom specifically though as it tends to be a hotbed of reaction and nationalism
socialism,not_removed,black america needs this white america is fucking lost in three camps imo those who agree there is an issue with police accountability and systemic racism this camp is lost because of incohesion and debates about what the next steps forward ought to be or what the end result ought to be the ignorant not necessarily bad but just have a lack of perspective and no frame of reference pretty subjective i admit the bigots fuck them they distort the ignorant camp with inyourface lies and hate the only way white america will get on board is if it isnt just kaepernick but a huge section of the nfl to do the same imagine if to percent of black nfl players did the same every game white america couldnt just point or single one player out for their shit theyd have to take on the entire nfl which i think is basically black arian foster of the miami dolphins about kaepernicks statement while his i understand where hes coming from is a positive move in the direction which is necessary he didnt agree with kaeps tactics that is a step back we need more black athletes to stand with kaep
socialism,not_removed,wat
socialism,not_removed,i agree that the nfl is too patriotic too jingoistic too violent and too commercial but people should be allowed to do whatever the hell they want to if theyre informed i dont care if they want to give themselves permanent brain damage and die at but i dont believe that they are rationally choosing that option since there is a massive system designed to make sure people are irrational and uninformed about the risks of playing american football
socialism,not_removed,hes black black americans have never enjoyed your bullshit liberal rights
socialism,not_removed,its amazing how conservatives talk about rights being natural and godgiven until someone stands up to the statethen theyre just not being grateful
socialism,not_removed,yes thank u mr state for pinky promising me not to throw me into a prison camp for doing something benign that offends people
socialism,not_removed,its a fundamentalist religion
socialism,not_removed,patriotism is just another tool to keep people from thinking for themselves makes them easier to control
socialism,not_removed,makes it easy to thin your facebook feed though
socialism,not_removed,football is pretty much where the mass line is im pretty sure this footballplayer with some vague progressive ideas does more to create a leftwing consciousness under youngster and working class people than the radicalleft does when they stand on the corner of the street this may sound cynic but the left needs to be strategic and try to make some alliances even if it is with millionaire sports players if that is where the masses are at
socialism,not_removed,nationalism is so fucked up cant even disagree with absurd wars and imperialism or else youre a traitor because were america we have to be right
socialism,not_removed,the priorities of your average citizen i disagree these are the priorities as set by the big news agencies they decide the talking points they decide what people should be outraged about and what gets completely ignored if the handling of syria was covered like the attack on the twin towers was covered if the handling of syria was covered like the malaysian airlines flight was covered if the handling of syria was covered like the olympics was covered nobody nobody would give a seconds notice about this anthem thing
socialism,not_removed,what happened in syria
socialism,not_removed,hey would you hapoen to have any links as to whats going on over there i want to get caught up
socialism,not_removed,im so glad he hasnt backed down on it though really proud of that because america loves football and itll keep what hes saying in the limelight maybe get a few more people that normally wouldnt to think about what hes saying
socialism,not_removed,when i was poor and complained about inequality they said i was bitter now that im rich and i complain about inequality they say im a hypocrite im beginning to think they just dont want to talk about inequality russell brand
socialism,not_removed,right the notion of solidarity like doesnt even register and of course on the other hand black people directly facing this oppression shouldnt protest either because theyre not oppressed either they just need to pull up their pants or some nonsense and bam a comfortable middleclass existence where no ones shooting at them no one can acknowledge the problem even exists without being wrong
socialism,not_removed,forty years ago you were a nigger lover now youre just a race baiter
socialism,not_removed,i disagree i would argue that the occupy movement was doomed from the start and ended up becoming a nonfocused mess of drugs and sex that further stigmatized the left
socialism,not_removed,nationalism not even once
socialism,not_removed,people in baltimore and dc shout o really loud toward the end of the anthem as an old orioles tradition and you should see the screeds that people post online about how it is disrespectful and should be banned in arenas etc it literally doesnt fucking matter
socialism,not_removed,they gave their lives and took many many others so you could protest so you shouldnt protest
socialism,not_removed,love me looove me love me im a liberal
socialism,not_removed,thats because theres no logic to it they are just fanatics
socialism,not_removed,sure the media will make you look like a bastard if you dont blindly obey some song and some flag and yeah it may even cost you your career or the state will label you an enemy merely for having a dissenting opinion but at least were not in cuba or the ussr amiriiiiiiiiite
socialism,not_removed,just heard of this one a few minutes ago httpwwwcsnphillycomphiladelphiaeagleseagleslbmyketavarreswilljoincolinkaepernickwontstandnationalanthem oh i thought about it believe me i definitely thought about it tavarres told espn and usually im front and center on the line with the rest of the guys and thats since prek all the way up saturdays game i stepped back i was in the background and it didnt feel right to me at all and so i will be taking a stand — or sitting down — for the fourth game weve got an issue in this country in this day and age and i feel like somebody needs to step up and we all need to step up weve got that right theres just a lot going on that people dont want to talk about and i feel like us as athletes were looked at as role models and i feel like with colin kaepernick hes doing a great job for standing up in what he believes in and most people may not like that but thats his opinion hes entitled to it and i respect him for doing it at some point i think guys in multiple sports across the country guys are starting to realize if we do want a change it is something we need to get involved in at some point jenkins said i have already done some things i have spoken to the police commissioner of philadelphia we are trying to come up with some plans to do some stuff on the ground and get some work done a lot of what is going on in the country is outrageous i try to be careful i ask myself what is the outcome that i want to see and how do i go about that at the end of the day when it comes down to relationships of african americans in this country right now my entire family is black i can sit on my stage and act like these things dont apply to me but my two brothers my dad my mom all of them are dealing with the same thing
socialism,not_removed,even in rsocialism people arent willing to think about what football and the professional sports industry in general do to our society sad
socialism,not_removed,i do think there has been a push recently to educate people about the dangers i know that my kids wont ever play football and most of my peers say the same thing however most of us are privileged and college educated the nfl continues to successfully target poor and poc communities
socialism,not_removed,youre ignoring the fact that its massively commercial people should have the right to play sure but it shouldnt be advertised there shouldnt be unpaid college students paying for the benefit of massive corporate sponsors etc
socialism,not_removed,i completely agree with you and i support colin kaepernick in what he did however it seems like the majority of americans dont agree with what he did and are up in arms about this lack of patriotism exhibited by him for whatever reason maybe its just my white privileged friends who ive seen attack him for this act of rebellion but ive seen little to no support for colin on social media my original post was referencing to how people are so upset about this act but completely disregard when there are actual life threatening unethical or immoral problems in our country or caused by this country on an international level
socialism,not_removed,american exceptionalism is deeply ingrained into american culture it has been since the founding of america every presidential campaign employs its rhetoric to that end its a waste of time to fight american nationalism its fading on its own only of year olds agree that american culture is superior to other cultures while of those over agreed of college graduates agreed pew research poll conducted in raise awareness of issues and show why we should be concerned instead of criticizing someones culture heavily else theyll see it as a personal attack and not listen
socialism,not_removed,tells you something about the country when disagreeing with war crimes makes you a traitor or literally just stating the position of martin luther king jr for instance who we have a national holiday for and people purport to admire would cause people to go hysterical
socialism,not_removed,the issue is pretty straightforward to be honest before nflamerican football games the united states national anthem is played theres usually a huge patriotic tribute often to veterans sometimes to victims but regardless of the reasoning it happens and a lot of americans take it very seriously like youll get a lot of flak if you are just a fan at the game and refuse to stand but colin kaepernick is a player used to be a starter now hes a backup i believe and he refused to stand and go along with the show like everyone else this was obviously caught on camera and the vast majority of americans are freaking out that hes being unamerican some people are going as far as saying hes a cancer to the team some are saying he hates white people and hates veterans all of this is in response to this simple act of not standing up during the national anthem there plenty of other things posted all over reddit on the topic i think theres an intercept article which is pretty decent thats currently at the top of rsocialism
socialism,not_removed,well see if he is able to weather the storm remember craig hodges he was blackballed for his political activism httpsenwikipediaorgwikicraighodgespoliticalactivism
socialism,not_removed,haha great quote
socialism,not_removed,russell brand is the man
socialism,not_removed,im pretty positive well find out in some number of years that it was subverted by the us government
socialism,not_removed,the fact that we are still talking about occupy as a proper noun and that the rhetoric of has made it into the mainstream is an achievement of the movement it was also hurt by coordinated and focused attacks by police enforcement to dismiss it as being a mess of drugs and sex is disregarding the fact that it was repressed fairly brutally by the government if youre actually interested in the accomplishments and realities of occupy you should read some of graebers commentary on it rather than taking the wellworn line of corporate media that it was a failure unorganized etcthey have a vested interest in making that the reality whether its true or not
socialism,not_removed,ended up becoming a nonfocused mess of drugs and sex i sadly ended up at the wrong camp apparently
socialism,not_removed,i didnt say that their movement worked but it was about sitting and occupying space
socialism,not_removed,if you dont mind me asking what is space communism exactly
socialism,not_removed,at san jose sharks games its tradition for us to yell hey other team you suck right before they start the national anthem you can always tell who is a first timer by who has a disgusted look on their face
socialism,not_removed,id be more than willing to the nfl in particular is one of american societys biggest and bestknown tumors but you cant blame colin kaepernick for the entire professional sports industry and you have to applaud a worker for exercising autonomy
socialism,not_removed,yeah i cant stand sports just compounding the jingoist tribalistic religious fundamentalist problems we have as well as diverting people away from things that actually matter and using up resources i do support this person with this though
socialism,not_removed,ive seen some support on social media from poc and some white liberals interestingly a friend of mine in the military is a very strong supporter of kaps actions
socialism,not_removed,its fading on its own thats interesting i suppose that correlates to the fact that for the first time in a long time people realize that their children the next generation will be worse off than their parents
socialism,not_removed,i didnt realize how disliked mlk when he was assassinated something like approval rate and even less than among blacks pure fucking ideology
socialism,not_removed,while i appreciate the effort into this post im all caught up on the kapernick thing i was wondering more about syria sorry for the confusion
socialism,not_removed,this is more likely than you might think fans are already saying he is trying to politicize his cut from the team that would have been for performance reasons otherwise
socialism,not_removed,yeah apparently he wasnt doing very well to begin with this season and on top of that hes a black quarterback which brings up a whole nother set of political bs if youre familiar with the history of the nfl long story short his days are likely numbered and this aint helping him at all the nfl and professional sports in general is full of a bunch of fucking reactionaries especially in front offices and coaching staffs as if that wasnt already obvious
socialism,not_removed,most likely however i still think that the ideology behind the movement aka lets negotiateappease with the was doomed from the start
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,didnt we already isnt that why jeremy hammond is in prison
socialism,not_removed,my arguments stem from close friends having participated in it its not only corporate media a lot of leftists agree that it was a mess
socialism,not_removed,thats fair my statement was in retrospect a tad totalitarian but like i said i dont agree with the fundamental ideology the movement stands on all the friends i have that went tell me it was a failure people just set up tent dropped acid smoked weed and fucked for days my friends say that they would wake up and try to organize but most of the people simply were trashing the place or mindlessly screaming we are the if you want a more nuanced and distanced criticism of the movement look at what zizek has to say about it i do agree with him on that
socialism,not_removed,oh well on those grounds then yesindeed it was
socialism,not_removed,as far as literal definition im not the best person to ask as i dont really focus on each branch of socialisms differences etc i just like thinking about it so i use the flair but my understanding is it focuses on communism on other planets like colonizing other planets and establishing utopia communist settlements fun fictional stuff around it also a lot of real theory about future advances based on how successful the soviets were in short periods of time with the space race
socialism,not_removed,fully automated luxury and gay
socialism,not_removed,i dont that it is a real tendency more like a hypothetical application of communism in a space faring societythink star trek beyond that it can basically be seen as an analysis of the ways which advanced technology can aid in creating a postscarcity society and the abolition of private property for instance i think that a good case can be made that asteroid mining would necessitate this abolition given the inherent difficulties of policing property lines in space this is our astroid quadrant but we were here first and then the space wild west becomes a violent mess
socialism,not_removed,ive been to preds games and theyve done sort of the same thing
socialism,not_removed,at florida panthers games we yell red when we hit that part of the anthem its the only part i say
socialism,not_removed,i also think a large part of it is access to information age of information etc printing press caused reform radio communications caused reform and now the internet i can learn about cultures outside of the usa now whereas the previous generation knew nothing but stereotypes i can interact with people all over the world i can have global news delivered i can find facts and statistics that id never know about
socialism,not_removed,me too if someone fills you in mind tagging me and ill return the favor
socialism,not_removed,sorry the syrian conflict is just all sorts of messed up at this moment ill try to give you a full description i dont really know how much detail you know the united states was backing the syrian democratic forcessdf the sdf is comprised primarily of the ypgmale kurdish militia and ypjfemale kurdish militia but also consists of arab forces and westerners who are either politically aligned with rojavaanarchists socialists even communists or people that just want to go after isis the sdf and the american lead coalitions air support recently took manbij manbij was a key cog to isis being able to funnel supporters from turkey deeper into their territory for trainingmanbij might have hosted training for isis supporters as well i dont really know or care to what extent manbij played a part rojavakurdish state in northern syria has three cantons afrinwestern canton jazirafar eastern canton including their capital and the kobani cantonwestern half of eastern canton and manbij lies just west of kobani and was the first piece to creating a fourth canton with the end goal to link all of rojava across northern syria httpsenwikipediaorgwikirojavamediafilerojavasvg the fact of the matter remains that the us and the coalition which the united states created has been backing the sdf in the war against isis this lets the sdf control their own destiny gives them the upper hand in the battlesisis has no airforce and gives reassurance to westerners that action is being taken against isis the sdf has been moving steadily with this support and manbij was a key cog in the war against the islamic state a high up united states general was quoted saying something along the lines that the intensity of that battle was unlike anything seen before out of an isis defense as everyone knows turkey hates the kurds they are constantly struggling with the pkk and the pkk is seen as a terrorist organization across the globe due to their constant attacks car bombs and other radical activity against the turkish state in eastern turkey turkey views rojava as an extension of the pkk despite the constant denial of this by the leadersor the closest thing to this as they are anarachist to some extent of rojava and the sdf regardless turkey doesnt want rojava to have a fully linked autonomous society across their border in northern syriasouth eastern turkey turkey has recently invaded norhtern syria in between the rojava cantons and originally stated they did so to fight isisisis has been there for years and turkey never invaded but anyone that knows the situation knows turkey is doing so to stop rojava from succeeding the united states is allied with turkey this is well known the us has just backed the sdf in taking manbij the sdf lost hundreds maybe even thousands of lives in this battle turkey has since told the ypgypj to withdraw from the west of the euphrates and has made it clear they have no intention in allowing the connection between west and east rojava turkey and the sdf have been fighting over the past week and things are just getting worse and worse in northern syria this is causing all kinds of unnecessary death and the united states is stuck in the middle of it all we can make all sorts of assessments to the situation like for instance the united states likes it when allies fight because they can then sell arms and ammunition to both sides however as far as i care this is the beginning of the end of rojavaturkey will destroy them in an all out war and rojava was the one spot of brightness coming out of the quagmire which is the modern day middle east
socialism,not_removed,well yeah but it was still something the feeling was there i feel like it could have been something greater
socialism,not_removed,i think it depends on each city i was in seattle the best thing that came out of occupy seattle was a layer of activists who are still out there to this day the slogans while imperfect people still have debates on what the correct percentile cutoff line should be drawn regarding bourgeoisie still resonate to this day vs while imperfect is still widely seen as a question of class and political power
socialism,not_removed,but what about gay space communism
socialism,not_removed,thats what i was thinking but i wasnt sure if it was a joke flair because were so far from inhabiting anywhere other than earth or if it is an issue written about by scientists economists and futurologists
socialism,not_removed,i think one time at a game versus dallas everyone booed when the singer got to the stars part of the song
socialism,not_removed,and also kids going th school getting their daily programming and then coming home logging on and immediately being able to find the truth for themselve theres a lot of shit to hate about the internet and the way its making us act but damn if it isnt a fucking mirror being held up for everybody to see reality
socialism,not_removed,will do
socialism,not_removed,i just responded to thereason above with a lengthy description
socialism,not_removed,nonviolence is doomed to failure unless there is a violent movement presenting an even less desirable alternative
socialism,not_removed,totally fair my experience is on ny
socialism,not_removed,even better
socialism,not_removed,see the civil rights movement and the black panthers
socialism,not_removed,fully automated luxury gay space communism
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,certainly the idea of a cultural revolution is an excellent one we have to confront not just the bourgeoisie but bourgeois ideas that are accepted as natural truth the cultural revolution as an event however got tied into late ccp party politics in a way that caused it to become dangerously undirected in places there were segments of the revolutionary youth that stayed true to the idea of building a new culture there were also those who abused the idea to bully and in a few extreme cases murder those they disliked
socialism,not_removed,good bad lol jk it was pretty shit the amount of gratuitous violence torture etc against capitalist roaders and the like was frankly absurd the chinese intelligentsia was essentially wiped out and i dont mean as a class or caste i mean they were literally shot and killed if you were even related to a capitalist roader then at the very least you were socially ostracized if not executed these kinds of excesses were rampant throughout the gpcr and all of this was done at the behest of mao and promao factions throughout the cpc in order to turf out the leadership and reinstate mao in order to prevent revisionism or counterrevolution of course mao got back into power then used the pla to crush the mass movements which formed around the gpcr as for stopping counterrevolution china is sure looking like that proletarian paradise right now aint it
socialism,not_removed,i dont know enough about it but i am not a huge fan of the antiintellectual strain it had going on a commie friend of mine however thinks it was great
socialism,not_removed,generally positive im basically echoing the other mlms in this thread here but i think that the gpcr was and still is an incredibly potent and important weapon when it comes to fighting the bourgeois superstructure that lingers after the revolution i think in china a whole new theoretical plane was reached and was incredibly important for socialist theoretical development mass participation was high and people especially young students truly held power many of these students formed voluntary groups in order to combat capitalist influence in fact many forget that it was the student movement in beijing i think that really kicked the whole thing off not mao himself however im not gonna ignore its shortcomings and mistakes yes many innocents were attacked and sometimes killed many intellectuals were needlessly attacked along with teachers many had their possessions taken away and destroyed and that was all a real shame but we need to learn and improve upon this in the future
socialism,not_removed,generally positive first and foremost i think in theory its true that we need a revolution of culture and it should take place shortly after the economic revolution or whatever i also think that it is important to move the centre of struggle away from party bureaucrats and into the hands of regular people especially young people there is more to the gpcr than red guards were mean to teachers in beijing because it was a year period it was clear that a bunch of revolution youths sometimes armed with the police asked to not crack down on them could get out of hand thats why mao created the campaign to get them into the country meet rural people help on farms etc what i find bizarre is communists who are siding with the rightists saying that the cultural revolution was bad for the economy or that semifeudal and semicolonial culture should be preserved or that the communist party or the cops should have cracked down on the students
socialism,not_removed,bourgies got rekt
socialism,not_removed,all joking aside it was a good thing during the gpcr many of the factories were put under worker self management waits for ukcsocialist to post the video it also destroyed much of feudal culture eg foot binding it also empowered regular people to rise up against the corrupt revisionist beurocracy and the struggle was carried out by normal people like you and me
socialism,not_removed,positive a necessary component of socialist revolution everywhere and the gpcr is an important subject of study for serious socialists unfortunately defeated by capitalist counterrevolutionaries in china
socialism,not_removed,a an omnipotent dictator who ate babies b the cultural revolution was a power grab pick one liberals
socialism,not_removed,i dont think it achieved its objectives revisionism got to the top party things got wrong etc i dont have any criticism of maoists saying how it could be eventually directed correctly
socialism,not_removed,negative it killed random people that had nothing to do with the capitalist system and oppressed millions ahem tibet red guards got out of control they were practically lynch mobs not to mention the massive destruction of chinas cultural heritage thousands of priceless artifacts and monuments then after it was a massive disaster of course they blamed of on maos wife nothing good came of it imo
socialism,not_removed,if you want ml and mlm responses you should ask in rcommunism as well
socialism,not_removed,as for stopping counterrevolution china is sure looking like that proletarian paradise right now aint it your grasp of chinese history is lacking the people targeted by the gpcr are the ones who came to power in the coup after maos death and put china on the capitalistsocialism with chinese characteristics path the fact that china is now capitalist has nothing to do with any alleged flaws of the gpcr unless you try to make the claim that not executing rightwing party leaders was a flaw
socialism,not_removed,on antiintellectualism the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas ie the class which is the ruling material force of society is at the same time its ruling intellectual force the class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production so that thereby generally speaking the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it the ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas marx german ideology since these various categories of traditional intellectualsput themselves forward as autonomous and independent of the dominant social group this selfassessment is not without consequences in the ideological and political field consequences of wideranging import the whole of idealist philosophy can easily be connected with this position assumed by the social complex of intellectuals and can be defined as the expression of that social utopia by which the intellectuals think of themselves as independent autonomous endowed with a character of their own etc gramsci bourgeois scholars always maintain that they are the representatives of so called pure science that all earthly sufferings all conflicting interests all the ups and downs of life the hunt for profit and other earthly and vulgar things have no relation whatever with their science their conception of the matter is approximately the following the scholar is a god seated on a sublime eminence observing dispassionately the life of society in all its varying forms bourgeois scholars speak of any branch of learning with mysterious awe as if it were a thing produced in heaven not on earth but as a matter of fact any science whatever it be grows out of the demands of society and class bukharin denying the scientific establishment the status of an impartial knowledge factory is a prudent recognition of the contingent material nature of scientific knowledge as social construct there was once a thriving scientific research programme into phrenology as a window into race as factual or even theoretical accounts of the world the phrenological texts would eventually be found dubious by science itself but considering their material function in society eg to justify racial oppression and imperialism immediately problematizes the whole enterprise uheidegger or maybe heidegger himself not sure
socialism,not_removed,but i think that the gpcr was and still is an incredibly potent and important weapon when it comes to fighting the bourgeois superstructure that lingers after the revolution yup definitely no bourgeoisie superstructure to speak of in modern day china china wasnt even bourgeoisie in the first place except for a couple of western imperialist enclaves it was feudal as much as that term can be used outside of europe anyways i think in china a whole new theoretical plane was reached is theoretical plane maoist parlance for the shanghai stock exchange or perhaps apples child labor factories however im not gonna ignore its shortcomings and mistakes yes many innocents were attacked and sometimes killed many intellectuals were needlessly attacked along with teachers many had their possessions taken away and destroyed and that was all a real shame but we need to learn and improve upon this in the future i would even be okay with all of that if the cultural revolution actually had removed aforementioned superstructures i would almost be okay with dismissing such excesses if the cultural revolution worked that is lasted longer than minutes after mao keeled
socialism,not_removed,the british banned various feudal regressive practices in british india such as httpsenwikipediaorgwikisatipractice does this justify imperialism
socialism,not_removed,semifeudal and semicolonial culture should be preserved i think history should be preserved yes if not culture or are you suggesting we topple the mayan and aztec ruins because of slavery and human sacrifice and sink india into the sea because of the caste system
socialism,not_removed,is that why china is run as a proletariat working class paradise if not just how rekt were the bourgies really is it possible you are simply suffering from confirmation bias or is confirmation bias a liberal invention too
socialism,not_removed,no need to wait for kc httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxcwafmgvls i think you were talking about
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately defeated by capitalist counterrevolutionaries in china wasnt the whole point of said revolution to root out the counterrevolutionaries wouldnt you say it failed then
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately defeated by capitalist counterrevolutionaries in china its our duty as communists to ensure that we arent defeated and make sacrifices worth it we cant afford to be defeated ever again
socialism,not_removed,why not both
socialism,not_removed,so it was negative because some innocent people died and some monuments were destroyed uh huh what about the whole superstructural revolution which was what the gpcr was the establishment of a new culture centered on the people the establishment of revolutionary councils in factories farms towns etc the removal of capitalist elements from power are you going to dismiss all of those because some people died or perhaps you should learn to be more nuanced
socialism,not_removed,lesson the value is to learn from chinas error btw have comrades seen
socialism,not_removed,the fact that after years of the gpcr in order to fight revisionism that the party just coincidentally managed to lapse into it immediately after maos death shows that the entire project was a failure yes deng and co were the targets of the gpcr and deng and co are the ones who took power again after maos death and thats precisely why the gpcr was a failure it failed to create structures institutions and properly educate the masses in order to push forward the revolution it simply created a means through which mao could remove his opposition from the party and basically control the partys direction unilaterally it was a power struggle not an ideological one in any meaningful sense because if it was a struggle against capitalist elements and capitalist ideology then it was a massive failure and theres no reason at all to recommend it
socialism,not_removed,of course class antagonisms effect what is researched and what is taught but there is still such a thing as objectivity the scientific method used properly reveals truth no matter who is using it
socialism,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikilysenkoism science that works is just science not proletarian science not alternative sciencemedicine not traditional science etc if it works its called science thats how the scientific method works rejecting the scientific method just because it is used by capitalist society is utterly absurd considering leninists and maoists are not even willing to abandon the state the purest most capitalist invention there is think dialectically comrade
socialism,not_removed,if its connected to your history and everyone else basically whose connected to that history agree who am i to say yall cant
socialism,not_removed,im just joking
socialism,not_removed,wasnt the whole point of said revolution to root out the counterrevolutionaries wouldnt you say it failed then like most proletarian movements like say the one in catalonia there were some successes but it failed yes mostly defeated militarily by the pla
socialism,not_removed,if you dont know what youre talking about you shouldnt talk about it until you do know the fact that after years of the gpcr in order to fight revisionism that the party just coincidentally managed to lapse into it immediately after maos death shows that the entire project was a failure yes deng and co were the targets of the gpcr and deng and co are the ones who took power again after maos death and thats precisely why the gpcr was a failure no the rehabilitation of deng and other capitalists in the was what led to them taking power not the removal of them from power during the gpcr the fact that the gpcr at least the most revolutionary period of it was ended in directly contradicts your argument it failed to create structures institutions and properly educate the masses in order to push forward the revolution it did create those structures if you had gotten to reading about the revolutionary committees councils etc established during the gpcr you might not be saying this now it simply created a means through which mao could remove his opposition from the party and basically control the partys direction unilaterally so uhh why did the masses follow mao in removing that opposition from power perhaps because they supported maoism and socialism instead of capitalist restoration in which case you should have no qualms about the removal of the opposition it was a power struggle not an ideological one in any meaningful sense because if it was a struggle against capitalist elements and capitalist ideology then it was a massive failure and theres no reason at all to recommend it again you havent demonstrated the failure the capitalist elements were removed from power in the they were rehabilitated in the after the revolutionary period of the gpcr and that rehabilitation is what allowed them to come back
socialism,not_removed,youre missing the point
socialism,not_removed,there was a vote on destroying chinese history during the cultural revolution no in fact people connected to that history who disagreed were disappeared
socialism,not_removed,yeah all those poor landlords and upperclass religious types were so oppressed
socialism,not_removed,are you saying only landlords and upper class religious types opposed the cultural revolution do you have any proof of that
socialism,not_removed,yeah i got a whole tonne of books what do you got
socialism,not_removed,christians also have a lot of books proves absolutely nothing come back when you have proof
socialism,not_removed,huh yes i have documented historical proof
socialism,not_removed,so cite it
socialism,not_removed,lets start with hundred day war by william hinton let me know if you can score a copy at a library or pdf
socialism,not_removed,hundred day war by william hinton before i waste my time did hinton count how many people who opposed the revolution were bougie scum if not its not a source
socialism,not_removed,yeah go ahead
socialism,not_removed,they also have a couple of other things in common all ars countries where the us has a particularly active and robust military presence some of those activities you may have noticed were not successfully kept out of western commercial media reports none are countries where trump feels the decree could result in significant loss of revenue to his personal holdings andor other entities with which he may have made arrangements the parties hope will be mutually advantageous my personal opinion or rather speculation tbh is that trumps advisors purposely did not edit the list for this initial decree in anticipation of the gist of your comment in the hope of deflecting criticism of the action itself and with regard to any among his own fanbase whose zeal might be less than fervent and their penchant for analytics less than marked to engender the perception that it was a measure authored and left pending by the previous administration for all that that might be in direct opposition to both spirit stated intent and action in every other case
socialism,not_removed,now he is just repeating history again side note how can it be called defense busget if the usa uses it for imperialism and antagonism
socialism,not_removed,well i cant really think of anything better to spend it on tbh
socialism,not_removed,this is really getting to me today i had to miss work today because im shitting blood feeling really cold dizzy nauseated got a migraine i can barely afford life things like food and housing let alone my medical shit on top of it and this asshole wants to spend money on a fucking wall and defense i can hear an altrighter trolling by saying that the best defense is a good offense sorry to add a layer of uncomfortable personal stuff on here
socialism,not_removed,you dont spend that much on the military without using it i fear that america will escalate its aggression if for no other reason than to justify the pricetag of its army
socialism,not_removed,wasnt he supposed to be less hawkish than clinton
socialism,not_removed,imperialism and antagonism budget just doesnt have the same ring to it
socialism,not_removed,war department lets say it we used to call it that
socialism,not_removed,absolutely we are going to war again soon yep some year old lower middle class kid in iowa is sitting in a school cafeteria right now and in a few years will be dying or having his limbs blown off crippled by a lifetime of crushing ptsd etc fighting in the middle east for a bloated orange uneducated clown who dodged the draft had a fortune handed to him by his family and has lived in a literal fucking gold castle the last thirty years who got elected by conning the bewilderingly uneducated bigoted rabidly christian middle of our country wholesale what a fucking amazing country weve crafted for ourselves
socialism,not_removed,were gonna rebuild our infrastructure literal meme
socialism,not_removed,nah its not uncomfortable personal stuff its reality its the effects of capitalism on your mind and body its a reminder of what we have to defeat
socialism,not_removed,the only hawkish thing even pushed about clinton was her desire for a un backed nofly zone in syria meanwhile trump advocated invadingnuking iran for its oil and said that the geneva convention is useless and then he openly advocated for war crimes with the whole kill all the families and relatives of terrorists thing
socialism,not_removed,only in a lindberghesque way
socialism,not_removed,i cant imagine trump declaring war and the american population just silently accepting the reality of yet another war if he starts some bullshit war i think thats going to be it thats where the riots and strikes begin
socialism,not_removed,im an year old senior in the inner city and im urging all my classmates to get their passports now because things might go down the drain i would fight for my country if i was proud of it but i am not and am completely at ease with draft dodging
socialism,not_removed,we cant have clinton because shes a warmonger trump fans trumps great because hell go hard on isis also trump fans
socialism,not_removed,the only hawkish thing even pushed about clinton was her desire for a un backed nofly zone in syria lol are we defending clinton now are we going to ignore that as secretary of state she basically catalyzed the civil war in syria
socialism,not_removed,maybe not now today but after a major terrorist attack or a series of them after a year of constant warmongering and saberrattling and even then just flatout pushing it through despite massive protests and the majority of the population being absolutely against it or at very best skeptical if the rulingclass is deadset on doing it theres really almost nothing we can do as a country to stop it
socialism,not_removed,surely not even trump would bring the draft back
socialism,not_removed,she started assad beginning essentially a genocide against his own people
socialism,not_removed,we cannot stop it without a strong left
socialism,not_removed,thats a defeatist attitude comrade if you really believe that then theres no point in being here is there
socialism,not_removed,maybe not now today but after a major fabricated terrorist attack or a series of them ftfy never forget bowling green
socialism,not_removed,surely he cant win the primary based on az surely he wont win the election because of az and surely he wont actually make an immigration ban im not saying its probably or even hinted at but i believe its a real possibility also every male not sure about females signs up for the draft as an year old if they want any help with college from fafsa if we get into a large active conflict and need troops me and any of my friends could get called into active duty
socialism,not_removed,he wont have to if the military is the only job available
socialism,not_removed,in she funded and armed theocratic rebels in syria she did this all knowing that in the secretary of state created a propaganda television broadcast regularly airing to the people of syria against the assad government
socialism,not_removed,understanding where we stand in the power dynamic is the first step to fixing it
socialism,not_removed,thats definitely fair
socialism,not_removed,i think they recently extended the selective service to women
socialism,not_removed,a capitalist country with a reactionary leader its main communist party is also reactionary blerg
socialism,not_removed,far right ethnic nationalists very imperialistic supports farright regimes all over the world more income inequality than the united states
socialism,not_removed,its capitalist like every other country
socialism,not_removed,theyre an oligarchy just like the usa
socialism,not_removed,ultra capitalistic right wing country used to be humanitys bright light too many leftists defend russia
socialism,not_removed,capitalist should not be supported by socialists for any reason russophilia and apologia in the name of antiimperialism is a frequent practice of stalinists but they are more irrelevant than they know
socialism,not_removed,i cant speak much on its economics or politics but i find its laws against the lgbt people to be the most disgusting possible without making it illegal yes you cannot be arrested for being gay in russia but you can be for telling people gay people exist how is that progress
socialism,not_removed,ultra rightwing do not support it neither do i support the former soviet union
socialism,not_removed,reactionary imperialists
socialism,not_removed,i still see the world more or less in terms of the cold war but instead of a socialist party trying to achieve commmunism you have competing bourgeoisies i think russia represents a necessary check against us imperialism but as others have said putin is pretty much a rightwinged reactionary so proceed with caution
socialism,not_removed,ok lemme just chime in here i am a nonsectarian marxist but my views tend to line up with stalinism and maoist thought i defend the legacy of the ussr greatly lemme just say that lenin and stalin would put putin and all the members of his government against the firing squad wall like the rightwing pieces of shit they are
socialism,not_removed,unlike all the liberals here who claim to be socialist russia is a country that needs to be protected against imperialism and needs to be respected yes its a capitalist country but its liberalism to not protect russia against incessant western imperialism
socialism,not_removed,oh yeah said that they wanted to change the ussr into china dude the fuck
socialism,not_removed,youre right the reason many still defend them may be strategic as a counterweight to the western forces which are seen as the primary imperialists and also may be evaluated as a lesser evil argument or for nostalgic feelings and reasoning
socialism,not_removed,whats the antipc answer
socialism,not_removed,those pesky imperialistic ukrainians
socialism,not_removed,your lesser evil anti imperialist bullshit is disgusting if protecting a antiworker capitalist transhomophobic imperialist state like russia makes us liberals then your a god damn fascist why dont you prop up a strongman elsewhere
socialism,not_removed,its a pretty liberal idea to support them because you think they are slightly less evil then the other guy get out of here you liberal fascist
socialism,not_removed,are they really a lesser evil at this point
socialism,not_removed,i can see one big strategic reason to support russia support against the west in the case of a revolution especially if your country is in an important position for usexpansion or a member of nato but other than that there isnt anything else at least not something that leftists would support
socialism,not_removed,you mean the ones who spark fascist uprisings under the guise of independence like with euromaiden holy shit this sub is basically fully reactionary at this point i cant believe what sanderism did to it
socialism,not_removed,agreed this attitude seems to be peddled by the remnants of stalinist groups in the west not much has changed it seems from their proimperialist attitude towards the allied powers in
socialism,not_removed,so your solution to those social issues russia is facing is to invade occupy and mass murder the people we should be supporting imperialism against russia
socialism,not_removed,certainly not but when you think of the confrontation in syria their support for authoritarian but more or less secular regime forces against isis and other islamist reactionaries gain them a certain level of sympathy at least in my country
socialism,not_removed,in the case of revolution are you serious do you really know any country on the brink of a revolutionary situation or crisis ok maybe greece so as to strategically get help from russia in case of a revolution not in the foreseeable future no
socialism,not_removed,ukraine may have fascists in its government but your analysis is incorrect to say that it has imperialist interests at this point in time russia isnt helping eastern ukrain in order to liberate ukraine but is doing it in the name of imperialism if russia really cared about liberating ukraine it could have done so by now instead its just sent troops in to take over a strategically important peninsula and the bordering territory now stop going on about how were all social democrats when youre spouting the most liberal analysis here
socialism,not_removed,the delusion of the left wing of capital is that the possibility of supporting neither imperialism or a capitalist state does not exist not to mention the absurdity of thinking that their personal opinion on the russian state matters much at all or even the opinion of their puny organizations
socialism,not_removed,it was the only thing i could think of as to play the devils advocate i am not really fond of the idea either if i am to be honest
socialism,not_removed,ok so just to set the record straight imperialist mass murder is absolutely ok against russia because its a capitalist country
socialism,not_removed,since you lacked the reading comprehension for my above comment no it is obviously not ok nor does it make any sense to support in your case say good things about them on the internet a capitalist state
socialism,not_removed,lacked the reading comprehension sorry liberalism repels me
socialism,not_removed,your ability to repeat the same word is astounding hopefully one day you might even digest its meaning
socialism,not_removed,your ability to keep repeating liberal views is astounding hopefully one day you might become a communist like you claim to be
socialism,not_removed,hold the phone is that a dreamcast in the background and youre reading luxemburg lets be friends
socialism,not_removed,im currently reading this same book its my first introduction to luxembourg and ive only read the authors introduction so far but im in awe already she was truly a remarkable woman this quote stood out not from luxembourg but from an eye witness to the german revolution what we saw in berlin was perhaps the largest proletariat mass action in history we do not believe that there were demonstrations on this scale in russia from the roland statue to the siegeallee the proletarians were marching rank upon rank there were marchers far away in the tiergarten they had brought their weapons and they carried their red banners they were ready to do anything and to give anything even their lives it was an army of such as no ludendorff had ever seen its a completely pointless exercise but you cant help but wonder what the world would look like today had the german revolution succeeded it would have sent human history in a completely opposite direction
socialism,not_removed,how did you manage that
socialism,not_removed,yes httpsyoutubeqzbmqmyydbk
socialism,not_removed,at my old job i get points for meeting sales goals and i use those points to buy things at party rewards site instead of a cash commission lucky enough they had a book store they actually had left wing books
socialism,not_removed,im glad someone else on this sub loves dreamcast too i was just playing crazy taxi dynamite cop and re on dc a week ago so great
socialism,not_removed,slightly related situation back when george w bush gave all americans an economic stimulus check i immediately bought a plane ticket to attend the socialism conference in chicago thanks dubya
socialism,not_removed,lol sure thats not how they thought that would turn out
socialism,not_removed,so capitalists not only make their own gravediggersbut they also do some of the grave digging themselves
socialism,not_removed,my employer doesnt own the party site im getting some of my surplus labor back and why no use that stolen labor back with books
socialism,not_removed,this guy seems smart and reasonable to me but im totally unclear on what hes actually advocating he wants a unified democratic socialist syria dont we all but doesnt seem to have anything approaching a platform on how to get there what is the group with an army that he wants to take over the country because thats the only way were getting rid of assad or isis military force i dont get the impression that prodemocracy rebels have much of a shot and he doesnt point to any particular groups he approves of so whats the next move its easy to say that both assad and isis are awful its tougher to find other options
socialism,not_removed,both assad and isis are awful im gonna repost something replace saudi arabia with isis as they have the same wahabbi ruling ideology to compare the syrian regime with the saudi regime is whats actual barbarism you deliberately forget atrocities committed by the rebels who are using civillians as human shields in rebelheld areas you deliberately ignore what syrians want because for you it means nothing you like to think that people support the fsa reactionaries fighting each other and backed by the turkish regime into killing right now as we speak people in kurdish areas and torturing them when they dont you forget deliberately that there are thousands of people in the syrian army that come from the popular classes of syria and arent at all comparable to the class nature of the saudi regimes state specifically ideologically these guys are basically putting at the same level a wahabbi us puppet fundamentalist state that has much to do with spreading this ideology that is right now being adopted by jihadists killing kurdish people syrians iraqis afghans libyans and yemeni people with a flawed but de facto constitutional secular regime whose main party against their own interest its constitutional character and is now with obvious flaws due to the depopulation of syria through the war sharing power where there is legal opposition and a national progressive coalition where there are in both cases marxist parties tankies included im gonna tell you what i always say about this you guys just want to believe the comfortable western narrative because it compells you at an emotional level not because you have any actual reason to actually investigate that things arent as simple as evanescent springs and colour revolutions that claim for western liberal democracy in the news
socialism,not_removed,did you read the interview assuming you did not one of the biggest themes is how horrified the syrian socialist activist being interviewed is at the rose colored glasses with which the international left views the assad regime im totally with you that both the saudis and isis are on a whole other level of terribleness compared to assad but dont fall prey to geopolitical lesser evilism the presence of those worse forces does not make assad less terrible
socialism,not_removed,problem is that this is not lesser evil against greater evil the issue in syria at this point is complete destruction of the syrian state which already made reforms that were against the very interests of the baath party removing its constitutional character being a notable one versus a minimal chance of not becoming a constant failed state for a decade or more the job is to secure the existence of something more or less unified in syria that resists control of its markets by several vulturecountries after the end of the conflict and in this outcome the communists must be the step forward in the direction of the popular movement being the war history edit by communists i dont mean the enlightened perestroikasupporter scp unified
socialism,not_removed,is this guy a socialist or even a leftist there is a growing convergence between the views of fascists and the farleft about syria and other issues the reason for this is that perspectives on the left are outdated they are interested in highpolitics not grassroots struggles they are dealing with grand ideologies and historical narratives but they dont see people — the syrian people arent represented they are holding on to depopulated discourses that dont represent human struggle life and death
socialism,not_removed,im fine with your position on the situation being that the assad regime is as good as its going to get for syria in the near term and that we should support it regaining control of the country but i dont see why youre so insistent that assads not so bad i hope the democrats do well in the next american election because theyre better than the alternative but that doesnt mean i ignore all the ways that theyre terrible you can hope that the syrian state does well in the current conflict without being an apologist for them
socialism,not_removed,hes coming up with grand theories and comparing other leftist groups he doesnt approve of to fascists how much more of a classic socialist can you get p
socialism,not_removed,nah this is a religous war
socialism,not_removed,likewise the church its adherents and all their dogma are just another pillar upholding the social order if the church names a target the state will act the opposite is just as true so to draw a line between ideologicalclasspolitical conflict and religious conflict just doesnt hold up
socialism,not_removed,the fact is that he is not properly citing this stuff in context fidel and his communistic regime was under immense pressure from capitalistic infiltration the need for repression of political dissent was for the livelihood of the nation especially after a country miles away tried to invade them using excitizens that were mostly from the upper classes it was disappointing on how the lbgtq were treated but compared to everywhere else during that time no country could say they treated these communities better in all his brutal dictatorship is being pushed by conservatives and passively accepted by liberals who do not acknowledge the struggles of running a communist nation while being infiltrated having an embargo and constant threats of assassinations all with the purpose of returning to a fascistic regime pinochet in chile is a great example of this fidel should be given more credit than the west wants to admit and this guy gets it all wrong
socialism,not_removed,theres also a good documentary about the cuban revolution on netflix called cuba the forgotten revolution
socialism,not_removed,other videos in this thread videocomment i agree with you that i dislike people that deny that problems exist as they very apparently do the guy from secular talk though is not one of those people in the video hes disagreeing with her argument and feminists that try to flip the op im sorry but youre just wrong about his stance on the death penalty this among other videos from back then i havent really watched him since then im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch ill keep this updated as long as i can httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get me on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
socialism,not_removed,love secular talk nuanced and objective approach to things
socialism,not_removed,absolutely marvelous sums up everything nicely all i can say is thank god twitter and facebook didnt exist when che was killed i wouldve flipped my fucking lid edit damn guys im sorry if you hate him but dont downvote a comrade maybe try educating me
socialism,not_removed,it was disappointing on how the lbgtq were treated the cuban government required all men to serve a term in the military but those who would not serve jehovahs witnesses conscientious objectors and those who were not allowed to serve gay men instead did their terms of service in agricultural camps as a part of military units to aid production umap the idea was for noncombatants to still strengthen the revolution domestically things quickly got out of hand and these became downright abusive a mark of the repression lgbt cubans faced even after the revolution those serving in these domestic military camps were beaten worked long hours and for all their service were viewed with the mar of the decadent to describe these as concentration camps would be going too far as their primary function was as a replacement for mandatory military service but they sometimes got dangerously close to that categorization around three years after these camps were established several concerned guards informed fidel castro of the abuses taking place within these camps curious fidel went under cover as a gay man into one of them at night and revealed himself as a guard was about to beat him the next morning following castros visit and the undercover visits of heterosexual communist youth following fidels example the umap camps were shut down however new camps under a similar purpose were established though they did not reach the levels of abuse of the umap camps they were often still unequally harsh in treatment compared to what faced those serving in normal positions in the military while the idea of the domestic support division of the military wasnt to repress gay men that was certainly the effect at the time castro said that while the camps were out of hand they were better than what gay men would suffer in the military however he has since taken personal responsibility for the horrid treatment of lgbt cubans at the hands of the cult of machismo the camps are long since gone in cubas slow march forward in the arena of lgbt rights began today gay cubans do serve in the military there are more equal rights sex change operations are covered by universal medical care and transgender cubans have been elected to the government
socialism,not_removed,the need for repression of political dissent was for the livelihood of the nation ml in a nutshell
socialism,not_removed,exactly what i was thinking jimmy screams capitalism every time shitty stuff happens but he wont take the plunge kyle uses the human nature argument so i imagine he can be converted i suspect chariton of being a closet socialist
socialism,not_removed,youre thinking of jordan chariton btw
socialism,not_removed,i maybe check secular talk about once every month or so but i do remember when he brought up chomsky and while he agreed with chomsky on most things he considers chomsky too far left for him haha yeah left liberals are weird
socialism,not_removed,sounds an awful lot like most people in society damn our country is run by corporations politicians are greedy things are shit hm such a mystery isnt it no idea whats causing all of these problems
socialism,not_removed,i honestly cant stand him since he openly proclaimed his support for assad and the death penalty in the us he is also one of the internets most hardcore antifeminists claiming that women dont have real issues to fight for since they gained the right to vote he really isnt someone that any socialist should look up to you are clearly on skooma jone and jode do not shine brightly on your path walker
socialism,not_removed,hes my favorite liberal maybe
socialism,not_removed,thats how revolution works
socialism,not_removed,would you rather have authoritarian socialism or no socialism at all
socialism,not_removed,well its nice to talk and dream about a perfect socialist society but lets be a little more realistic when it comes to cuba cuba is located at the worst possible geographical location for a socialist revolution right at the backdoor of the worlds most powerful and hostile nation overthrowing the cuban government was top priority for the us it almost lead to a nuclear war having a form of libertarian socialism under such hostile conditions is daydreaming
socialism,not_removed,i think jordan has become more of a lefty as the election season went on especially during his disappearing middle class tour and all the times he is at standing rock same with jimmy also give em time or get someone like r wolff on jimmys show lol
socialism,not_removed,he just didnt agree with his anarchism kyle said he read on anarchism but he settles with a welfare state like sweden
socialism,not_removed,skooma dont joke about skooma comrade it has destroyed the lives of countless poor khajiits
socialism,not_removed,im sorry but youre just wrong about his stance on the death penalty httpsmyoutubecomwatchvsjasemjmieg
socialism,not_removed,what can you provide prof to your statement
socialism,not_removed,hes so close someone just needs to inch himabit forward
socialism,not_removed,if history is anything to go by then there is no such thing as authoritarian socialism every time an authoritarian gets into power with supposedly socialist goals it devolves into a state capitalist program revolving around a personality cult thats why i dont get all this castro circle jerking if he actually ever was a legitimate socialist then it is clear he failed miserably
socialism,not_removed,im confident theyll take the plunge they just need more time my god though can you imagine having an ally in jordan and jimmy and kyle that would be beautiful
socialism,not_removed,maiq once walked the path to true socialism so many steps he lost count
socialism,not_removed,as i said to uomic he has apparently changed his viw on the death penalty which is good he did however state his support for the death penalty in a video from i think early which i unfortunately have not been able to find
socialism,not_removed,i havent seen his video supporting assad so im not sure where hes coming from on that but there are plenty of communists who support him on antiimperialist grounds that are perfectly legitimate so i dont think thats really a problem i remember him praising assads reign in a video about the war in syria back in you cant just go around praising rulers like assads just because their countries have been victims of imperialism assad is a brutal reactionary dictator whithout any regard for the people of syria no matter how much some socialists like to pretend otherwise i also know hes been very clear about being against the death penalty on several occassions so i have no idea why you would say that i dont remember in which video he said it but i clearly remember him speaking in favour of death penalty he may very well have changed his opinion though that video is likely quite old i also cant stand him for his antifeminist views though i could overlook the other stuff but his antifeminism is definitely too much
socialism,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvaqieugeftu among other videos from back then i havent really watched him since then
socialism,not_removed,maybe on some issues but in many ways he is still extremely right wing
socialism,not_removed,if he actually ever was a legitimate socialist then it is clear he failed miserably we failed miserably castro had succeeded in securing and maintaining control of cuba while we sat idly by waiting for others to do the revolution for us
socialism,not_removed,would certainly help spread the message thats for sure jimmy and jordan both have a quickly growing base of people
socialism,not_removed,khajiit has wares if you have labor vouchers
socialism,not_removed,yeah but he often repeats altright talking points about sjws and third way feminists
socialism,not_removed,like he seems to be a socdem all around to me
socialism,not_removed,oh yeah these guys are the definition of up and coming
socialism,not_removed,too much capitalism can be dangerous maiq once owned two corporations and the proletariat burned his factory down
socialism,not_removed,what did you disagree with in that video shouldnt that be pretty obvious i disagree with everything that he says in that video as it is purely made to discredit the womens liberation movement and make feminists seem like idiots fighting problems that dont exist he opposes all progress when it comes to womens rights by denying that any problems exist when they clearly do i despise people like him
socialism,not_removed,see my above comments
socialism,not_removed,if you watch some of his videos on trump youll often see him calling trump a rightwing sjw and comparing him to authoritarian leftist college kids who want to censor people he also mocks safe spaces and trigger warnings pretty often those talking points are pretty similar to those made by the alt right i cant find a video right now but if you watch some of his stuff you probably know what im talking about
socialism,not_removed,but whats wrong with pointing out the blatant hypocrisy of the altright
socialism,not_removed,nothing my problem with those statements is his attacks against sjws
socialism,not_removed,i dont understand the issue sjws to the extent that they exist are pretty terrible the problem is when rightwing idiots wrongly tar actual feminists and leftists with the sjw brush
socialism,not_removed,sjw is nothing but a buzzword for feminists and leftists
socialism,not_removed,depends on the context the altright sure likes to use it that way but i find it greatly amusing when its turned on its head and pointed out that by their own standards its the altright who are the ultimate sjw pc outrage police
socialism,not_removed,this sign would lead to terrible miscommunication
socialism,not_removed,needs single quotes
socialism,not_removed,can someone give a little context
socialism,not_removed,solidarity with our kurdish brothers and sisters
socialism,not_removed,do they mean that fascist party or the state or what
socialism,not_removed,who do they want to smash second though
socialism,not_removed,ura
socialism,not_removed,possibly a stupid question but is this picture real
socialism,not_removed,britain first is a fascist group a sympathizer recently murdered jo cox a politician who supported refugees and remaining in the eu
socialism,not_removed,i doubt these are kurds
socialism,not_removed,both work with the assassination of jo cox in mind however i assume they mean the party
socialism,not_removed,im also confused by this
socialism,not_removed,yes solidarity
socialism,not_removed,just so youre not confused theyre saying crush britain first not britain first
socialism,not_removed,there are british nationals in rojava i recall seeing a video where a fighter with a british accent was reading a statement
socialism,not_removed,start
socialism,not_removed,trotbanned
socialism,not_removed,fascist fuck off
socialism,not_removed,thank you comrade sorry to hear the news
socialism,not_removed,that makes a lot of sense i was sitting here thinking smashing britain first seems like a weird priority for a group surrounding by isis iran turkey and the assad regime
socialism,not_removed,in the us i remember hearing they are considered terrorists by the state not sure though
socialism,not_removed,which is a shame because they are counter revolutionary and are undermining the free syrian army by siding with a brutal oppressive dictator
socialism,not_removed,says the teenage edgelord
socialism,not_removed,yes most people ive spoken to support them though even right wingers
socialism,not_removed,no the us has been supporting them for years only turkey calls them terrorists
socialism,not_removed,i dont think we should shame people for their age it sounds a bit condescending age doesnt mean anything young people have historically been at the head of great social change
socialism,not_removed,apparently some texan veterans went over to fight with them but immediately left to join an assyrian christian militia after finding out the ypg were in his own words a bunch of damn reds haha
socialism,not_removed,assad in syria instead of supporting there oppressed brothers and sisters in syria that take up arms against a tyrant they shoot at them i am all for kurdish liberation but theres a thing called critical support and the left refuse to criticize the pkk of ypg
socialism,not_removed,im actually barely out of my teens its just a fun way to piss off the fashies to point out the majority of their ranks are prepubescent sociopaths
socialism,not_removed,not a teenager what the fuck is with the birdscratches im a fucking socialist theres no quotation to it
socialism,not_removed,looks like we found another person with a world view so narrow and education so deficient that they think anyone who disagrees with them must be younger than them so sad
socialism,not_removed,sorry this is bs they are nonbelligerent towards the regime but they are not allies as we speak there are skirmishes in hasaka between regime supporters and the ypgthis is totally understandable considering they are surrounded by isis and the regime has a ypg enclave held hostage by the balls in aleppo city they are also nonbelligerent towards the fsa and even supportive of fsa joining them so long as they support a secular decentralized and democratic syria and a good number of fsa groups like jaysh al thuwar and liwa thuwar al raqqa are allies of the ypg and founding members of the sdf the fsa groups that the ypg has been in conflict with are mostly islamist leaning rebels who have little interest secularism or in multiculturalism that respects kurdish culture these are the same fsa groups that shell civilian kurdish areas indiscriminately these groups are not comrades they are closer to islamist fascists
socialism,not_removed,its funny when people who cant come up with a legitimate response say something along the lines of people under dont understand the real world i believe that there are plenty of intelligent educated teenagers and plenty of ignorant adults we should really not be so ignorant as to discredit someone opinion based on their age
socialism,not_removed,im on my phone now but when i get home tomorrow ill give you some articles then but the australian newspaper red flag has a lot of good articles on it red flag is published by the trotskyist organisation im apart of
socialism,not_removed,i dont remember calling you a fascist
socialism,not_removed,heres an argument against right wing libertarianism from a libertarian perspective you cant abolish oppressive government institutions just by deregulating the market the reason that the government is so corrupt is that its run by the capitalists for the capitalists the state exists as a tool for the interests of their socioeconomic class if you ignore this and leave the capitalists with their money theyll reverse any well meaning reforms you put into place in contrast socialist want to put political pose in the hands of the workers working class interests fair rewards for labor good education no rentseeking line up much better with the idea of a fair and free society
socialism,not_removed,ask him for actual data because i guarantee that he cannot substantiate his claim in any way and he also said that socialism and by extension communism will always lead to fascism fascism is rightwing nationalism communism is leftwing internationalism
socialism,not_removed,the effect of the concentration of wealth is to yield concentration of power first libertarian was a french anarchocommunist poet joseph dejacqueand he identified himself as a libertarian in a letter criticizing pierrejoseph proudhon for his sexist views on women libertarians stole the word because they needed a more attractive name than conservatives free market fundamentalismpropertarianism isntand it never will be libertarianism how can someone support capitalism and still call himself a libertarian is beyond me a libertarian is someone who upholds liberty as his primary political objectivenot someone who upholds defense of private property as his primary political objective markets cannot exist without states not only to institute physical infrastructures but enforce property rights establish a framework for contracts manage class relations and address the contradictions and crises that markets inexorably bring capital vol chapter
socialism,not_removed,please observe our antiableism rule and not use words like dt here i will reapprove your post when you edit it out
socialism,not_removed,thank you also how can i get through to him that socialism is a voice for the people and not a dictatorship like he thinks it is
socialism,not_removed,is there anywhere to watch this
socialism,not_removed,its actually available on youtube its essentially a dramatization about what couldve potentially happened if tony benn or michael foot became pm
socialism,not_removed,thank you
socialism,not_removed,there was one on my campus too a few weeks back i tore it down and threw it away and i havent seen any more since
socialism,not_removed,tear it down first if the fascists are persistent and put a new one up then you start defacing
socialism,not_removed,that might be what i end up doing actually i decided to sit out near it and see if anyone else something and two older men showed up and started talking to people near it dont think they have anything to do with the poster but you never know they were talking to quietly for me to hear anything as i passed again probably gonna go with this maybe print some stickers for later
socialism,not_removed,how do you pronounce rojava is it a soft j like in spanish or a hard one like the indonesian island
socialism,not_removed,is the us supporting rojava based on my rough knowledge of area geopolitics id guess we probably arent for various dumb reasons
socialism,not_removed,tripped r a j like the s in measure and stress on the first syllable
socialism,not_removed,helping them with air strikes for now the us doesnt have a great history with supporting leftist organizations in the past though so i wouldnt expect that to remain the case forever
socialism,not_removed,the us cooperated with the ussr when it was useful then they became enemies same is going to happen here theyre useful for now then the us will probably fund a coup within their ranks to make them harmless go into war against them because theyre terrorists or simply try to contained them and make the world forget about them
socialism,not_removed,poem by eman lacaba we are tribeless and all tribes are ours we are homeless and all homes are ours we are nameless and all names are ours to the fascists we are the faceless enemy who come like thieves in the night angels of death the ever moving shining secret eye of the storm the road less traveled by weve taken and that has made all the difference the barefoot army of the wilderness we all should be in time awakened the masses are messiah here among workers and peasants our lost generation has found its true its only home
socialism,not_removed,what are you talking about
socialism,not_removed,the new peoples army are actual maoists not third worldists
socialism,not_removed,get this fake news out of here
socialism,not_removed,does david harvey always wear red for a reason
socialism,not_removed,city dev guy is seriously out of his element deadweight harvard guy is moderately interesting and at least understands what harvey is talking about and can carry on a conversation agreement or not though its always interesting to note how the productive aspect of capitalism has almost entirely left the ideology of its supporters im surprised harvard guy didnt realize harveys point about google as a rent seeking organization lol city guy thinks the cycle of investment increasing tax revenue is something david harvey is going to be stumped on this is embarrassing they should have set up a better panel of people who could actually interact this guy is a laugh and doesnt answer the questions hes asked hes more politician than anything else my takeaway david harvey is very polite and patient
socialism,not_removed,minutes in and i feel like im being set up to watch dudes dogpile dude oh and none of them seem to be able to understand a damn thing harvey is saying like theyre all so locked in about this connection between the creation of physical things and parasitism they dont see even a little bit about how what hes talking about isnt what is being made but who is doing the work that is generating profit edit holy crap these guys are misrepresenting harveys words at every chance this is a room of people that are now dumber for having attended geeze edit to harveys credit he has really influenced the conversation the moderator keeps trying to steer the conversation into a new york is so wonderful everything is great rosy picture of the city but harvey doesnt even have to say anything for the tone of the conversation to immediately become well actually thats a load of shit and this place sucks it has major problems and none of them are being addressed even a little bit for anyone that isnt a billionaire
socialism,not_removed,my thoughts exactly
socialism,not_removed,love this whole russia thing i mean the us needles in elections all the time and topples governments if it doesnt like the way an election turned out even if russia meddeled in the elections it doesnt even add up to a fraction of what the us does every single fucking day
socialism,not_removed,doesnt mean we should ignore it or claim that it did not happen a lot of comrades keep insisting it never happened but yet there seems to be a ton of signs pointing to it having happened yes america has done similar things but this is still a sign of escalation from the russian federation if this actually happened
socialism,not_removed,i think the claims of russian involvement are legit but i dont think the involvement itself is all that important yes the russian federation is resurgent anyone with half a brain could see that by how quickly theyve been snatching up middle eastern nations into their sphere any meddling in foreign elections being the most minor manifestation of russian imperial ambitions all the drama built up around whether or not the russians helped tip the scales in trumps favor is largely a distraction i think
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately too many people here will deny it ever happening to be clear i dont want further escalation from the us on this matter only for replacement of trump and a blow to the gop but im afraid russias imperial ambition is going to cause war the world doesnt need that kind of conflict
socialism,not_removed,were cutting regulations massively for small business and large business so that soon there will only be a couple of large business lording over us unopposed by any law
socialism,not_removed,well well well this may come as a surprise to everyone the bourgeoisie using its monopoly on violence to clear out dissenters acab
socialism,not_removed,much love to comrade pink shirt
socialism,not_removed,did that asshole at seriously spray down people walking down the stairs away from him
socialism,not_removed,here is another reminder that cops arent our friends its funny seeing the liberals over in rpolitics starting to complain about it now that liberals are the ones getting beaten
socialism,not_removed,acab especially seattle pd
socialism,not_removed,also they arrested up to individuals who were holding the line in a nonviolent manner most were released with no charges one or two received assault charges
socialism,not_removed,utterly ridiculous police are given too much freedom to do these things
socialism,not_removed,and you could see his overseer watching it and doing nothing about it
socialism,not_removed,and he was the deputy chief
socialism,not_removed,absolutely proletariat
socialism,not_removed,its very obvious to see under anarchocapitalism that ludicrous oxymoron that it would turn into a worse dictatorship of the wealthy than we already have
socialism,not_removed,are anarcho capitalists actually stupid what would they do without a state and tons of ministates wed just crush them one by one and socialism would be way easier strategy right there
socialism,not_removed,isnt anarchocapitalism just a form of modern day feudalism
socialism,not_removed,it also wont ever happen so theres that
socialism,not_removed,obviously ancaps suck but the argument your ideas would result in a violent dictatorship alone doesnt discredit the perspective many attempts at socialism have resulted in power vacuums where fascists authoritarians and plutocrats seized power
socialism,not_removed,are ancaps really this fucking stupid and misguided or are they just rich assholes who are perfectly aware of how their ideas would function
socialism,not_removed,i think that because they keep the ability to exploit labor for accumulation of capital they would either end up back at this stage of corporatism as they call it or if the capitalists that accumulate the most wealth are too stupid to instigate their own personal state to stabilize the capitalist system it would just be utter chaos and the socialists would eventually take over to stop that nonsense
socialism,not_removed,i actually think if ancaps had their way it would very quickly lead to a socialist society under the horrible and brutal conditions of ancapistan the workers wouldnt tolerate that shit for very long also without a state to protect the capitalists and their private property they would have a difficult time defending themselves when the workers finally got fed up and seized the means of production i firmly believe the capitalists who back the ideas of right wing libertarians ie koch brothers would never allow them to create an anarchocapitalist society they only let people play around with these ideas in order to present the illusion of a viable alternative to the current system thus distracting people from looking into the ideas of libertarian socialism anarchocommunism marx ect
socialism,not_removed,what is a pacifist socialist im not sure there can be such a thing thats akin to saying i want revolution but i dont want to have to do any of the work
socialism,not_removed,at least for all its sins there are some restrictions on the power of the wealthy in liberal democratic systems you take that away and we have warlordism with century efficiency its chilling to think of i dont know how these people have deluded themselves into believing that signing a contract under threat of force makes everything legitimate
socialism,not_removed,you say that as though ancaps even try to do anything
socialism,not_removed,former ancap here in their perfect society everyone would be willing slaves to the capitalist system and everyone would abide by the nap so there wouldnt be any violent revolutions also im sure many of them would love to have their own pinochet so that they could kill all those statist cucks are anarcho capitalists actually stupid yes
socialism,not_removed,i think that it varies i remember one from a summer camp in highschool and i think that there was some kind of emotional problem underlying his views if one wants to be reactionary there are so many better ways to be it in than to just fix oneself on property seize northern syria and a piece of turkey and create yourself prince of antiochaleppo and subdivide the territory creating yourself some counts become alexander more feudalism some kind of futuristic space fascism i suppose that a certain type of petty bourgeoise idiots can get together and like an ancap fantasy though when they get together they cant all be the prince and while theyd be happy being counts i imagine that they fear that they wouldnt be thus ancapism where every selfowning farmer has a country i suppose that they could also be cowards without any real revolutionary character but still want this kind of thing and settle for what theyve gotten
socialism,not_removed,isnt capitalism just a form of modernday feudalism
socialism,not_removed,the end goal of ancapism has never been the frightening thing about it as you point out its an impossibility the frightening thing about it as well as right wing libertarianism in general which i cant help but notice has just been recently discovered by the media as a conservative alternative to trump is that it will be used to conduct a more open and brutal class war it wont succeed in limiting the state or in shrinking the military or ending monopoly control but it will succeed in being the narrative by which the gains made by organized labor will be placed back decades at a time
socialism,not_removed,while it is true that any revolution can lead to violent dictatorship it is important to note that the argument being put forth here is that an ancap utopia will unavoidably lead to one which is an entirely different argument
socialism,not_removed,based on anecdotal evidence which i recognize isnt necessarily accurate the average ancap is drawn to the idea of maximum liberty and theyve uncritically accepted the idea that freedom necessarily leads to improvements in most facets of life the more welloff ancapsright libertarians the koch brothers eg like to parrot the mantras of economic freedom benefiting all humanity but id wager they would accept government intervention should their property and profits ever be under threat
socialism,not_removed,both
socialism,not_removed,the latter
socialism,not_removed,my views have changed a lot since i made this account im still generally against unnecessary violence but i recognize it as an unfortunate necessity that may need to be used as a last resort
socialism,not_removed,i had the same reaction when i came across anarchopacifism but ive learned that apparently most of them happen to agree with the anarchosyndicalist method of seizing the mop
socialism,not_removed,well being against modern imperial wars will get you labeled as a pacifist by many people
socialism,not_removed,but force doesnt exist in an ancap society everything is perfectly consensual s
socialism,not_removed,total unaccountable private tyranny
socialism,not_removed,come on now your being unfair sometimes they buy things online with bitcoin
socialism,not_removed,but were slaves to the capitalist system anyway its basically the same but instead of having a unified liberal state theres private company military so mini states
socialism,not_removed,also im sure many of them would love to have their own pinochet warning cringe
socialism,not_removed,it is but ancapitalism would be even worse
socialism,not_removed,correct the few times libertarianism has managed to slither into political halls of power theyve trampled the poor mercilessly and this is a political ideology that was created entirely from scratch with money and effort something worthy of study in itself
socialism,not_removed,also democratic socialism inherently resists tyranny where as ayncraps both facilitate and encourage it
socialism,not_removed,its the exact same argument made by antisocialists
socialism,not_removed,thanks for the explanation
socialism,not_removed,i dont understand what is the connection with ancaps and bitcoin
socialism,not_removed,because we all know from history having thousands of city states competing with each other for resourcesgold leads to a peaceful utopia
socialism,not_removed,well i dunno capitalism without a state would do one of two things degrade into state capitalism due to the need for protection from the lower classes hasten a socialist revolution the only thing holding the system together is the state trying to strike a balance between capitals need for expansion and capitals survival no state means no barrier between the workers and the capitalists
socialism,not_removed,dont forget us actual anarchists we resist tyranny as well
socialism,not_removed,well sure but that doesnt make it invalid
socialism,not_removed,why would individuals who own themselves be any more tyrannical than individuals who are owned by the community the fuck does that even mean do you really think communismsocialism means individuals are owned by the community
socialism,not_removed,your descriptions can go both ways individuals who own themselves workers who own the means of production own the labor they produce and have a say in it thus they own their own hard work and whatever it results in this is socialism individuals who are owned by the community change community with bourgeois and you have a capitalist society where workers are bound by the contract they sign and all their work is owned by their boss protected by the police
socialism,not_removed,why would individuals who own themselves be any more tyrannical than individuals who are owned by the community communism people owned by the community i think your understanding of communism is flawed to say the least
socialism,not_removed,watch ops video
socialism,not_removed,this would be even worse like company states for every private enterprise a damn state eventually monopoly would reappear even if they did and so centralized state fucking sense i swear
socialism,not_removed,yeah im not claiming ancapitalism could ever work in practice i was merely argumenting about the hypotheticals here i always like to use this point when argumenting against ancaps aswell they always fail to understand why capitalism cannot work without a state
socialism,not_removed,empirical evidence does
socialism,not_removed,so the entire point is just going off the record
socialism,not_removed,snow crash
socialism,not_removed,you ever play shadowrun thats basically the premise
socialism,not_removed,welcome to century india
socialism,not_removed,rpunintentional
socialism,not_removed,thats not how ownership works ownership is simply a legal construct enforced by the state dysnomi owns y is just a different way of saying the state violently enforces disnomis claim to y no state no property law
socialism,not_removed,we dont need an example of an ancap society we already had something close to it in the earlier days of the united states entire towns were owned by individuals citizens who having no economic capital of their own would be forced to rent themselves as miners and labourers they had no labour laws such as minimum wages safety regulations or unemployment insurance they would go home to their rented housing that was owned by the landlord they would shop in the stores owned by the landlord if they tried to form unions which they struggled endlessly to do they would have union officials assassinated by hired guns and strike demonstration broken by private mercenaries those workers had the same freedom as workers in an ancap world would have none
socialism,not_removed,an optimal ancap society with private courts would mean of productive hours are spent in arbitration trying to get stuff done arguing over which court should handle the issue who has the rights to ownership damages and externalaties etc and who enforces the contract if its not upheld and then who holds the enforcer accountable if they try to enforce even if the contract is upheld there just isnt any time to do anything useful given how many civil services we take for granted in modern society
socialism,not_removed,do you think ancaps are anarchists just because they stole the term anarchism from the left what is a private defense agency that violently enforces private property if not a privately run state this is pure semantics ancapistan is just a bunch of ministates but they dont use the term state so therefore they must beprofreedom this is what happens when stupid people focus exclusively on the words that are being used not the actual content
socialism,not_removed,publicly notices relevant flair
socialism,not_removed,good old uncle enzo
socialism,not_removed,except shadowruns cool as fuck
socialism,not_removed,yea i had actually done a small research on it to prepare a writeup which never finished i do support the concept to an extent though
socialism,not_removed,so do you see why it doesnt make sense to speak of selfownership when there is no state to enforce this ownership
socialism,not_removed,but the kurds are socialists not ancaps you are using a socialist movement to defend anarchocapitalism dont you see how absurd that is
socialism,not_removed,i was halfjoking communism and capitalism are incompatible the fact that you dont even get that is ridiculous
socialism,not_removed,actually you cant because ownership is a legal construct and there is no inherent legal dimension to you simply violently excluding others it only makes sense to speak of legality in the context of law and thus the state
socialism,not_removed,you sure could is that really useful though
socialism,not_removed,but thats not even the point you are speaking of ownership when there is no state no property law and no legal authority to enforce this ownership claim again ownership is a legal construct you simply defending yourself has nothing to do with ownership stop being so fucking dense honestly
socialism,not_removed,how is that a troll im trying to explain to you that it doesnt make sense to speak of ownership when there is no state property law or any legal authority enforcing that law and if there is a legal authority enforcing property law its not a stateless society by definition the only stateless society that could possibly exist is full communism a moneyless stateless and classless society as long as there are social classes there is going to be a state in one form or another
socialism,not_removed,the individual is the legal authority your ownership is derived from your use of an object not from the state nor from a private defense contractor thats not how ownership works have you never looked into property law and how it actually works the state literally decides who owns what
socialism,not_removed,we live under statism under anarchism the individual decides thats a meaningless platitude whenever two or more people claim ownership over a resource or a thing you necessarily need a state or some statelike legal authority to ultimately decide who owns it the only way to get around this problem is to have resources owned collectively in other words communism private property is fundamentally incompatible with a stateless society
socialism,not_removed,if a successful socialist revolution occurred in britain in the would it have fared better economically and than the russian and chinese socialist governments or create a more true socialist state it very well might have im inclined to believe a revolution in more industrialised societies would make socialism work better in contrary to russia and china both of which were extremely poor and rural societies with little industrialistation
socialism,not_removed,it would have fared slightly better than russia or china since it was a wealthy and industrialized country however it would face problems being the first and only socialist country in the world namely economic manipulation by the rest of the capitalist world embargoes and funding of reactionaries within the country britain also doesnt have a whole wealth of natural resources like russia and china didstill do and it would be difficult to achieve selfsufficiency
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,but for me by far the worst and most unforgivable thing he has done was to skip fidels funeral this is why the left continue to be marginalized because most of us prioritize meaningless symbolic gestures over actual effective action going to a funeral is a formality it doesnt put bread in anyones mouth make anyone safer or protect our civil liberties why should we care if trudeau were doing the right thing on pipelines the terrorism bill and all that then he could urinate on castros grave and i wouldnt care much
socialism,not_removed,im not disappointed its entirely what i expected
socialism,not_removed,its because its
socialism,not_removed,i think you need to set your priorities straight if youre only annoyedslightly angered by like real and important political reform and fulfilling promises or the lack thereof and then enraged because he didnt attend a funeral of a former head of state
socialism,not_removed,has he legaiized marijuana yet
socialism,not_removed,some people really thought a party that won using the current electoral system would change it all up trudeau has a weathervane where his principles should be like most of his party historically
socialism,not_removed,saudi beheads gays never heard of that i thought it was a public humiliation through gentle lashing or whatever eitherway he should be ashamed of him self because of the otherstuff in op
socialism,not_removed,are those mutually exclusive
socialism,not_removed,liberals gonna liberal
socialism,not_removed,hes actually been able to surprise me i thought even trudeau wasnt cynical enough to go back in voting reform i mean he would benefit most from it thered never be another conservative government again but of course trudeau has no principles
socialism,not_removed,that will be in spring
socialism,not_removed,nobody was talking about batistas funeral
socialism,not_removed,conservatives gonna conservative libruls gonna librul and it should come as no shock that they will all kowtow to their overlords when the time comes it doesnt disappoint me so much as i know its just the oppositions natural state just like a newtons cradle the marble at the middle wont move unless the ones on the fringe give it a good slap in the face
socialism,not_removed,there is no such thing as authoritarian socialism and every socialist wants democracy the question is how exactly that democracy is scaled and where you would want direct versus representative democracy
socialism,not_removed,all revolution is authoritarian to those who lose power
socialism,not_removed,because i believe that we need a strong entity to hold off imperialists during the early stages i understand the dangers of that such as how in the ussr the vanguard just became a new bureaucracy however i am not convinced that we can properly resist in the early stages without a strong vanguard party that being said i think the authoritarian party needs to be temporary and step down as soon as it is able to do so safely after that i believe we should have an anarchocommunist society
socialism,not_removed,what is authoritarian socialism thats just a slander used towards marxistleninists to discredit us marxismleninism is inherently democratic
socialism,not_removed,democratic socialism doesnt mean a socialism that is democratic but socialism of any kind achieved through a democratic legislative framework
socialism,not_removed,all revolution is authoritarian what revolution is a class pressing its authority against another democracy is a failed concept created just for the bourgeoisie an illusionary form of government which is to represent the interests of some mass known only as the people the interests actually being represented are that of sections of the bourgeoisie which hope to maintain class rule
socialism,not_removed,political and economic control belong to the people via socialist economy and direct democracy yes generally authoritarian socialists desire this as well what exactly is your question
socialism,not_removed,i personally dont like democracy in general as it lets to many people who are uneducated in politics and political ideology make decisions i only want people with an education in politics making our decisions i mean look at how trump came to power and does he have any experience or education in politics
socialism,not_removed,why not libertarian socialism thats the real question
socialism,not_removed,there is no such thing as authoritarian socialism
socialism,not_removed,sure but thats a woefully trivial way of looking at things is the revolution going to continue to be authoritarian after the fact when it comes to the nonbureaucratic group or not every iteration of leninist revolution to date has suffered from this turns out that absolute power is a bit difficult to manage relinquish once held by a supposed dictatorship of the proletariat that is conveniently not actually comprised of all that many proletariat
socialism,not_removed,im referring to direct power
socialism,not_removed,apologies i was lacking a better term again sorry
socialism,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikidemocraticsocialism
socialism,not_removed,social democracy is a mix of capitalism and socialism to say that the only way to socialism is via violent revolution is an insult to marx himself who would disagree
socialism,not_removed,which has nothing to do with the context of ops post nor the semantics behind the word authoritarian in political conversations read the actual links youre sending
socialism,not_removed,no big deal it happens i got a little defensive tbh no worries
socialism,not_removed,luxembourg was killed by the farright with the implicit support of socialdemocrats kronstadt and the ukrainian free state attacked the soviets when they were in the middle war defending oneself isnt authoritarian its a matter of self preservation
socialism,not_removed,what are you talking about i like marx and engels advocate for the creation of a totalitarian state how is that not authoritarian
socialism,not_removed,marx had expressed belief that the working class could achieve power through democratic elections but that working people had the right to revolt if they were denied political expression
socialism,not_removed,thats nice and all but it has nothing to do with what op is talking about and what they mean behind the word authority
socialism,not_removed,a totalitarian socialist state would have two classes the ruling class and the other class orwellian in nature i much like orwell am a democratic socialist believing that politically and socially we must be equals or there will never be true socialism
socialism,not_removed,on kronstadt island which strategically guards entrance to saint petersburg in the middle of a war it had to be done the bolsheviks actually succeeded in having a revolution something neither anarchists nor democratic socialists have ever done
socialism,not_removed,op is talking about and what they mean behind the word authority perhaps you can enlighten me it seems like theyre referring to opposition to democracy and socialist economy whatever that is
socialism,not_removed,no real socialist advocates for that type of system people of the more leninist or maoist persuasion advocate for a proletarian state in the transition to socialism but the goal would be to end up at a classless stateless and moneyless society ie communism democratic socialists advocate ushering in socialism through parliamentary means rather than overtly revolutionary ones however all socialists advocate for democracy and equal rights for all the disagreement you are attempting to ask about is not a matter of goals but of tactics
socialism,not_removed,classes arent determined by political power theyre determined by ones relationship with the productive forces of society which would be the same for everybody regardless of political standing
socialism,not_removed,yes and engels doesnt oppose democratic decision making anywhere in that article hes talking about the imposition of will of one class upon another op is talking about the word authority in the context of democratic decision making under a socialist society
socialism,not_removed,yes but you mix the two i believe in a direct democratic socialist state not a communist state a stateless society is subject to invasion as well as coup without the state we have a hard time pursuing sciences building infrastructure and eventually going into space without a means to coordinate human effort a classless society is just another word for anarchy which is fine as human nature would eventually lead to the eventual power grab if we dont rule ourselves someone else will
socialism,not_removed,but still the government controls production so if that government cannot be controlled by the worker than we arrive at the same class system where the worker and the government and its official are ruling class because they control the means of production not the worker
socialism,not_removed,of course there were problems with the soviet union but it was still a step in the right direction and the first real attempt at socialism no one else has shown a viable alternative route to power
socialism,not_removed,how can the imposition of one class over another coexist with democracy are you suggesting that we should allow reactionaries and counterrevolutionaries take part in revolutionary decision making
socialism,not_removed,yes but you mix the two i believe in a direct democratic socialist state not a communist state since communism is classless ill assume you mean a worker or proletarian state a proletarian state is democratic so i dont really know what your qualms about it are a stateless society is subject to invasion as well as coup stateless does not mean no authority or no organization without the state we have a hard time pursuing sciences building infrastructure and eventually going into space without a means to coordinate human effort state in this context is defined as a machine for the oppression of one class by another the state is used to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority if governance is used instead as an organizational tool to benefit all of society then that society is stateless in your example in an anarchistcommunist society a classless society there is nothing prohibiting society as a whole from organizing production to be able to go on space missions in fact many would argue that scientific discovery would be a higher priority in such a system a classless society is just another word for anarchy which is fine as human nature would eventually lead to the eventual power grab anarchy is classless but anarchy doesnt mean chaos no rules disorder etc anarchism is a tendency within socialism that also advocates for a classless and stateless society again stateless meaning no ruling class operating the bureaucratic functions of government to maintain their own power and classless as in everyone collectively owns the means of production you should check out the socialism httpswwwredditcomrsocialismwikilistofideologies if we dont rule ourselves someone else will classless and stateless doesnt mean disorder it means that society as a whole collectively owns and gets to make decisions about the organization and functioning of society anarchism and communism aim to remove class rule and instate collective rule for the benefit of all which necessitates direct democracy
socialism,not_removed,the dictatorship of the proletariat means that the proletariat is the state why would it be something different from the proletariat from the start if the state is something separate form the working class and it owns the means of production but the workers have democratic control over the state then it is just capitalism
socialism,not_removed,are you suggesting that we should allow reactionaries and counterrevolutionaries take part in revolutionary decision making no im not im talking about the working class collectively making decisions in their lives democracy like in workplaces and political offices that mechanism would need to be safeguarded from the counterrevolutionaries you mention who would want to return to capitalism an undemocratic system
socialism,not_removed,so if workers control the the means of production via a unified system that relies on their input direct democracy it is capitalism but if this vanguard party and its members control the means of production by way of forcing legislation down everyones throat because we know better that is a few strokes shy of fascism and exactly what orwell warned about big brother the vanguard party knows best without the workers overseeing the transition it will always result in tyranny because to much power in so few hands is always bound to the same result everytime humans have tried to impose their will on other humans it has always failed
socialism,not_removed,education the more educated a population is the more likely it is to be socialist and marx was born a long time ago and could only account for what he saw then and he agreed that democracy lead to socialism so its our duty to educate and allow things to happen naturally without violence once we force things down peoples throats you better be ready to destroyed the populations that disagree or prepare for inevitable demise of the party it watch it turn into russia or china or north korea clearly attempting to force such things are doomed to fail if socialism is elected we must remain ready to defend to prevent foreign or domestic interference with the democratic process
socialism,not_removed,im talking about the working class collectively making decisions in their lives why should the course of my life be decided collectively does the working class get to decide what i eat for lunch tomorrow and the direction i part my hair communism is about free association of conscious producers not the bourgeois mode of organisation that is democracy
socialism,not_removed,thats not what a vanguard is the vanguard is just a way of organizing its still suppose to consist of revolutionary proletarians the ussr and so on arent good examples because they kept all capitalist relations and the contradiction between the state and people was too big there are more ways to organize the vanguard than democratic centralism jesus christ lay of the fam orwell was an aggressive homophobe and police informant
socialism,not_removed,does the working class get to decide what i eat for lunch tomorrow and the direction i part my hair yes clearly when people refer to proletarian democracy theyre talking about other people deciding your lunch and hairstyle also socialism is about stealing your toothbrush
socialism,not_removed,lol you advocate for the working class collectively making decisions in my life and then mock m for giving you an example of what this might look like why cant the working class decide those things wouldnt that be their collective will
socialism,not_removed,this isnt a debate sub go somewhere else with this bullshit
socialism,not_removed,so now noones allowed to disagree with one another on this sub
socialism,not_removed,well this is a sub for socialists if you wanna argue with socialists go to a debate sub
socialism,not_removed,but im also a socialist
socialism,not_removed,arguing with other socialists isnt acting like a socialist have you ever read the german ideology or on authority or critique of the gotha programme
socialism,not_removed,there will still be people who find a way to use this fact against cuba
socialism,not_removed,sorry to break the circlejerk here but the unicef link embedded in the article doesnt actually say that they do not have enough data to make a conclusion edit there is data but its not
socialism,not_removed,honestly im disappointed with how the anarchists in ranarchism are responding to his death he did a lot of really good things to decolonize cuba and lift people out of poverty yes he was an authoritarian who suppressed anarchists and gays and we should be critical of him and all rulers but the wrongs does not negate the good that he did
socialism,not_removed,anyone got statistics on countries like america or antisocialistcommunist also does cuba count as world im not sure what the specifics are to be world
socialism,not_removed,ive heard libertarians complain that this creates dependency on the state from birth like dude theyre children fucking feed them and shut up about it
socialism,not_removed,how many free speeches did castro murder to feed those children
socialism,not_removed,in the united states for over a hundred years the ruling interests tirelessly propagated anticommunism among the populace until it became more like a religious orthodoxy than a political analysis during the cold war the anticommunist ideological framework could transform any data about existing communist societies into hostile evidence if the soviets refused to negotiate a point they were intransigent and belligerent if they appeared willing to make concessions this was but a skillful ploy to put us off our guard by opposing arms limitations they would have demonstrated their aggressive intent but when in fact they supported most armament treaties it was because they were mendacious and manipulative if the churches in the ussr were empty this demonstrated that religion was suppressed but if the churches were full this meant the people were rejecting the regimes atheistic ideology if the workers went on strike as happened on infrequent occasions this was evidence of their alienation from the collectivist system if they didnt go on strike this was because they were intimidated and lacked freedom a scarcity of consumer goods demonstrated the failure of the economic system an improvement in consumer supplies meant only that the leaders were attempting to placate a restive population and so maintain a firmer hold over them if communists in the united states played an important role struggling for the rights of workers the poor africanamericans women and others this was only their guileful way of gathering support among disfranchised groups and gaining power for themselves how one gained power by fighting for the rights of powerless groups was never explained what we are dealing with is a nonfalsifiable orthodoxy so assiduously marketed by the ruling interests that it affected people across the entire political spectrum
socialism,not_removed,probably people saying shit like theyre able to be fed because of all the people that were forced out of cuba or manipulating reports
socialism,not_removed,clearly they are brainwashed into being not hungry
socialism,not_removed,i didnt see that in the unicef article but i did see that the infant mortality rate in cuba is the lowest of all of latin america and the caribbean
socialism,not_removed,i think theyre getting that because the report was published in the of underweight children in cuba is listed as the report says that latin american countries are reducing their of underweight children by an average of per year the author is assuming that is a definite and not of last years of underweight children i have no idea how theyre calculating it the article was written in if you make those assumptions you come up with malnutrition in cuba thats just my theory and i personally wouldnt be comfortable making those assumptions the httpdatauniceforgtopicnutritionmalnutrition revision has cuba at but it also says the information is from
socialism,not_removed,im on mobile and cant easily check but if what youre saying is true we really need to either get this post removed or get a misleading title flair or something
socialism,not_removed,eh ranarchism by and large acknowledged that he did some decent things for cuba and fought imperialism they also acknowledged that he was an authoritarian who suppressed anarchists and gays which is something some on this sub handwaved away wrongs dont negate the good but the good doesnt negate the wrongs either
socialism,not_removed,castro is like a case study in why anarchists dont trust mls why would we mourn a guy who imprisoned and repressed anarchists
socialism,not_removed,we should be critical of him this many news outletspeople are only seeing him from one side castro was a complex personality who did both good and some no so good deeds
socialism,not_removed,i think first world refers to countries that chose a side during the cold war im probably wrong though
socialism,not_removed,cuba would be second world because it was soviet aligned
socialism,not_removed,httpscommonswikimediaorgwikifilehumanwelfareandecologicalfootprintsustainabilityjpg this is a relevant statistic
socialism,not_removed,world world is apparently not commonly used to classify countries anymore theyre now classified on a sliding scale from lessdeveloped to moredeveloped
socialism,not_removed,everyone knows that hungry children are more motivated to try never mind all that sociological data showing they do better in school when fed
socialism,not_removed,ive heard libertarians theres your problem right there comrade
socialism,not_removed,the children of cuba are fed exclusively on the freeze peaches taken from the capitalists
socialism,not_removed,wont somebody think of the freeze peaches
socialism,not_removed,many peaches were thawed in the process
socialism,not_removed,that was a great read where is it from
socialism,not_removed,i looked at the report cited the report says cuba is making very good progress and is doing far better than a lot of latin america but it has a rate of children being underweight i dont see anything that says cuba has zero child malnutrition
socialism,not_removed,that you didnt see that in the unicef article is exactly the point
socialism,not_removed,reducing by would be
socialism,not_removed,are underweight different from malnutrition
socialism,not_removed,if im correct didnt he later change his views on homosexuality and apologise for his past views and actions against them
socialism,not_removed,this is something that all sects of socialism should consider there were good and bad aspects of castro and nether side should be ignored
socialism,not_removed,sucking che guevaras cock and calling stalin your sugar daddy how did you get into my diary
socialism,not_removed,id call young stalin daddy tbh fam
socialism,not_removed,im not saying mourn him just that not everything he did was bad always be critical and vigilent of authoritarians but dont dsicredit the things he did to benefit the cuban peple
socialism,not_removed,tankies like to accuse us of being liberals as soon as we dare criticise the regimes of anyone labelling themselves a communist if youre not in support of the dprks glorious stand against western imperialism then youre a filthy liberal who supports capitalist proxy wars and loves nato dialectics not even once
socialism,not_removed,yes and no yes cuba had close ties with the ussr and was effectively a soviet ally but no cuba wasnt in the warsaw pact and was a member of the nonaligned movement from onward
socialism,not_removed,forget adderall just starve your kid theyll focus right up all the cool parents are doing it
socialism,not_removed,well i think you should at least page collected by the united nations unicef and if youre actually interested in how they collect this data their httpswwwuniceforgstatistics neither of them suggest that cuba or any other country on the list are simply making shit up this doesnt come directly from the cuban government this report which is what the post references is from more updated numbers appear httpswwwuniceforginfobycountrycubastatisticshtml when they are available and cuba has continued to improve also cant say ive ever met a libertarian that wanted children to starve but your story sounds cooler this is all about phrasing isnt it of course nobody wants the children to die think of the children but they would like to cut the programs that feed them so who really cares how you skew it
socialism,not_removed,libertarians may not want children to starve but theyre certainly not willing to trust the government to prevent it which is basically the only way thats going to happen private charities have never been enough in any modern society to stop child malnutrition just because they mean well doesnt mean theyre not wrong
socialism,not_removed,i heard they also use meat harvested from all billions the innocent fascists castro personally killed s
socialism,not_removed,castro fed them with the stolen peaches
socialism,not_removed,from michael parentis
socialism,not_removed,is that rate betterworse than the us
socialism,not_removed,i looked through it but couldnt find what youre saying im not saying youre wrong i just didnt see it
socialism,not_removed,he did that doesnt change that he did it but yeah he apologized and changed his view
socialism,not_removed,they legalized homosexuality years before the united states did
socialism,not_removed,true for a lot of historical figures in this sub
socialism,not_removed,pretty enough papa che was sexy af
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,most behave otherwise
socialism,not_removed,i dont support dictators just because it occasionally benefitted the working class i get why vanguardist marxists might support him but im an anarchist i dont care if you declare it national blowjob day if its done from the other side of a gun
socialism,not_removed,world is nato member states specifically
socialism,not_removed,yep thats it
socialism,not_removed,wow what a great article i am now getting the book
socialism,not_removed,according to the report the us has a rate of children being underweight but it also looks like theres a lot of data missing from the us so take that with a grain of salt im not sure underweightness alone is a good measure of the availability of nutrition anyway we know people can be overweight but getting insufficient nutrients also i was medically underweight for a lot of my childhood because of long term complications from being very preemie not because of diet
socialism,not_removed,oh yeah it definitely doesnt change what he did but it is important to acknowledge that he did change his view
socialism,not_removed,shit its been a while since i listened to them ill have to pull them up on my way home tonight
socialism,not_removed,yeah just look at this horrible quote by castro about political prisoners held under his regime the weeds must be torn out by their roots there cannot be and must not be pity for the enemies of the people but their rehabilitation through work and that is precisely what the new ministerial order creating work camps seeks oh wait nvm that quote was by the cnt minister of justice in anarchist catalonia fucking totalitarian pricks
socialism,not_removed,i just get the feeling that you didnt read any of that before your initial claim and in general have an unrealistic view of how these types of statistics are gathered or did you just think that a fleet of un doctors swept the globe making house calls and check ups for billions of children every few years i mean honestly what do you think would be a good method for collecting this data if you just reject all information coming out of the nation and did you notice that a lot of oppressive countries have pretty bad scores as well what do you make of that that they trashed themselves and the un just accepted it
socialism,not_removed,being underweight can have a lot to do with body type as well i have a friend whos only an inch or two shorter than me and weighs about pounds less definitely underweight but the guy eats like a bear btw im tall and lbs so not overweight at all
socialism,not_removed,they put out an album back in called this packed funeral thats pretty good if you havent heard it
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,no bleating in an identical fashion to liberals about totalitarianism and how great nato and its proxies are doesnt exactly inspire confidence however not ml for the record
socialism,not_removed,what makes you think i have any more respect for that person than castro youre right he sounds like a prick and i wont try to convince you otherwise
socialism,not_removed,cool sounds like we have a noncntsupporting anarchist over here thats novel if you denounceignore proudhon and bakunin for being nazilevel antisemites then well know you are a real anarchist anyhow my point was that its always better to have nuance in understanding history for example i mourn castro as a dead icon of a better world and understand that hindsight is as castro himself put it a revolution is not a bed of roses while it might now be obvious that castros way of doing things isnt the way we want to go going forward i think its important to understand thats definitely not how a cuban in the would have seen things its also important to understand that the choice was pretty much castro or batista as far as guys with armies goes i also think even though i consider anarchists comrades you might even understand why castro was imprisoning them he was trying to make things better for cubans in an authoritarian way for sure but then these guys kept saying that he wasnt doing socialism right and that the state needed to be destroyed anyhow after that i just want to say as a disclaimer that imprisoning anarchists is bad and i like dont support it going forward we need to have revolutionary movements that contain all sorts and ask for their imput postrevolution tldr nuance is good
socialism,not_removed,totalitarianism is not a real thing real anarchists wouldnt support nato or its proxies heres hoping
socialism,not_removed,was he an evil monster no he just holds no relevance for me or for what i consider to be a revolution
socialism,not_removed,its just nonsense slander against socialist projects by imperialist propaganda organs everything characterizing totalitarian is either false or could also apply to conditions in capitalist nations
socialism,not_removed,could also apply to conditions in capitalist nations its fair to say that an anarchist a real anarchist would acknowledge this capitalist and supposedly communist nations are all tyrannical in their own ways
socialism,not_removed,totalitarianism is not into real wtf are you actually a troll or
socialism,not_removed,a real anarchist would acknowledge this agreed
socialism,not_removed,probably talking about the theory of totalitarianism not that no authoritarian regimes have ever existed communist or otherwise because the theory of totalitarianism is pretty highly contested in historical circles and most socialists that i know anyways lol reject it because it pretty much exists to paint the picture that communist regimes can be equated to fascism and that theyre actually following this same monolithic generalization of essentially anything antiamerican it was relevant during the cold war and a pretty legitimate propaganda tool since it was a really easy way to compare the ussr to the third reich and all communists to nazis and of course this was never applied to capitalist puppet dictators or anything like that so yeah its actually pretty shit and id hope no anarchist would resort to that
socialism,not_removed,literally nothing ever stops one from saying whatever they want but freedom doesnt mean other people have to accept the things one says if one says things which dont respect the freedom of others then calling a black person the nword and other such instances necessarily takes away any freedom in the situation that either parties had for instance if someone calls a homosexual person a faggot and that person calls them an httpiimgurcomgugspqljpg both people are in a sense acting freely however they are also simultaneously in a sense taking away the freedom of the other to be free means to be acknowledged and treated as such by all his fellowmen the liberty of every individual is only the reflection of his own humanity or his human right through the conscience of all free men his brothers and his equals i am truly free only when all human beings men and women are equally free the freedom of other men far from negating or limiting my freedom is on the contrary its necessary premise and confirmation it is the slavery of other men that sets up a barrier to my freedom or what amounts to the same thing it is their bestiality which is the negation of my humanity for my dignity as a man my human right which consists of refusing to obey any other man and to determine my own acts in conformity with my convictions is reflected by the equally free conscience of all and confirmed by the consent of all humanity my personal freedom confirmed by the liberty of all extends to infinity mikhail bakunin to talk about freedom in a strictly individual sense is nonsense freedom can only be social a person living alone in the woods is neither free or unfree because they have nothing that acknowledges their freedom they are simply alone
socialism,not_removed,it doesnt exist period you will be hard pressed to find a time where it did existed imagine declaring loyalty to stalin during the red scare expressing fascist views in the us during expressing pro monarchist views after the murican revolution and today pledging loyalty to isis it doesnt exist it never has to say so is delusional if someone decided to pledge loyalty to isis as of now would liberals chock it up to frozen peaches i dont think so also there is someone in solitary confinement all for the crime of possessing anarchist literature where are those liberals crying over his frozen peaches when it comes to frozen peaches liberals dont have a leg to stand on what about the frozen peaches under pinochet the khmer rouge nazi germany the indonesian occupation of east timor the batista regime all of these backed by the united states although the us later betrayed the nazis with the suppression of frozen peaches of views threatening to the us socialism during red scare fascism during isis now liberals are full of shit freedom of speech doesnt exist
socialism,not_removed,a telesur production wow good job telesur clear concise and without any tinfoilhat appeals
socialism,not_removed,wow this is a really interesting video i didnt know that zionism started off as a fringe movement without popular support among european jews is there something that happened in europe during the that changed jewish attitudes towards returning to their homeland im a little unfamiliar with global history and the video doesnt mention anything
socialism,not_removed,quit with your sarcasm the holocaust is mentioned at secondly its not their homeland to return to its the palestinians who were forced out who know the villages towns and houses that they their parents their parents parents etc lived and were expelled from
socialism,not_removed,the problem isnt jews going to israel the problem is palestinians being kicked out
socialism,not_removed,if its not their homeland where did the jewish people come from
socialism,not_removed,was zionism a thing before the holocaust and just took a stronger hold afterwards or did it just develop afterwards
socialism,not_removed,and the solution isnt kicking anyone out either
socialism,not_removed,its their homeland as well as palestenians the jews just spread and immigrated after several empires rolled through
socialism,not_removed,the zionist movement started in the late and zionist jews were going to palestine since then but the holocaust made it stronger and served as a justification
socialism,not_removed,the zionist movement started in response to the pogroms in eastern europe primarily ukraine
socialism,not_removed,memes go on rfullcommunism
socialism,not_removed,its pretty boring to have art style and only art style for over years in my opinion
socialism,not_removed,much posters no socialism
socialism,not_removed,🙄
socialism,not_removed,i agree with the articles main point but i dont believe that richard wolff believes that socialism can be achieved solely through the creation of coops i think his main point in promoting coops is just to point out that such an alternative is possible
socialism,not_removed,the use of co ops is only useful to provide a living for decenting workers and to form an auxiliary in a dual power scenario for example socialism cannot be achieved by co ops but they are one of the many tools at our disposal to support a revolution
socialism,not_removed,no
socialism,not_removed,i see the wolffster get some grief on here sometimes for not advocating revolution but i think as an economist that is not his job that is the job of the mass of people i think his job is to show alternatives to capitalism and that a better system can be achieved
socialism,not_removed,hes pointed out before that he is not proposing cooperatives as an endall beall solution and that he would be wrong to do so his whole point on focusing on coops is to add to future socialisms what was left out in the past namely economic democracy
socialism,not_removed,yes but were getting really good at dismissing people who dont explicitly or vocally advocate revolution as unimportant or social democrats so why stop now s
socialism,not_removed,i just love how much this offends the type of people that complain about people being offended too often
socialism,not_removed,colin kaepernick is righter than you know freaked me out for half a second p
socialism,not_removed,how long until liberals make changing the lyrics of the national anthem their next pet cause
socialism,not_removed,comrade kaepernick flair pls
socialism,not_removed,maybe its all ancient meaningless history or maybe its not and kaepernick is right and we really need a new national anthem i agree i recommend
socialism,not_removed,uk citizens here feel the same way about our anthem god save the queen athiest save our oppressors flag waving morons belting this out without thinking what it means sends me head mental 😩
socialism,not_removed,and genocide dont forget genocide
socialism,not_removed,honestly i dont think this is what those words mean
socialism,not_removed,as a teacher i am met with criticism from my students because i mentioned how i appreciate kaep even more they kept lambasting him about not standing we are an alternative school where we dont say the pledge i asked them if they go home and take time out of their day to say the pledge they said the last time they said the pledge was when they were at their old school i went on about how come we have to listeningsing the anthem at every single sports event i mean cmon a ford truck month lasts days and every sports event is a nationalism enema was i this infatuated with my country when i was their age
socialism,not_removed,patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel oscare wilde
socialism,not_removed,the line in question is referring to the british not actual slaves
socialism,not_removed,so glad he is not backing down does no one else see that these little controversies pop up on a daily basis he should just ignore the attention and in a few days when the season starts everyone will have moved on to feigning outrage over something else
socialism,not_removed,twitter then went predictably nuts with at least one fan burning kaepernicks jersey that is late stage capitalism on so many levels
socialism,not_removed,righter is not an adjective does anyone read anymore
socialism,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment maybe its all ancient meaningless history or maybe its not and kaepernick is right and we really need a new national anthem i agree i recommend this one on a serious note having a different anthem would be so cool maybe its just since i grew up singing the star spangled banner every morning in school im tired of it but tbh its just an ugly song lol solidarity forever robesons march of the vo id like to nominate this as appropriate why not this one imo this one would make a wonderful us anthem im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
socialism,not_removed,til thanks this is a great post just another reason that america the beautiful should be our national anthem
socialism,not_removed,but youre all getting offended about stupid stuff like protecting other peoples cultures and heritage this is something that really matters protecting my culture and heritage s
socialism,not_removed,stupid commienazi sjws tramplin muh freezepeach right to be politically incorrect on a totally unrelated note lets drum kaepernick out of his job andor his country for expressing political views i consider to be hold on while i search for the right word here incorrect
socialism,not_removed,this is literally canada
socialism,not_removed,i would wear that with pride
socialism,not_removed,or this land is your land by woody guthrie easy to sing rails against private property written by an american communist
socialism,not_removed,i was about to say fuck you and your empire
socialism,not_removed,not the billy bragg version
socialism,not_removed,on a serious note having a different anthem would be so cool maybe its just since i grew up singing the star spangled banner every morning in school im tired of it but tbh its just an ugly song lol solidarity forever robesons march of the volunteers or with appropriate words for a red republic would be so much nicer
socialism,not_removed,id like to nominate as appropriate
socialism,not_removed,imo httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkhscylvsvna would make a wonderful us anthem
socialism,not_removed,god save the queen the fascist regime
socialism,not_removed,where in god save the queen does it talk about saving oppressors i dont know much about the song so maybe theres something im missing
socialism,not_removed,to be sure but genocide per se isnt explicitly called out in the lyrics only the killing in battle of slaves who joined the british invasion force in exchange for their freedom one could definitely interpret the bridge of the fourth stanza then conquer we must when our cause it is just and this be our motto in god is our trust as celebrating the ethnic cleansing of the nonchristian indigenous peoples of north america but its not explicit in the same way as the third stanza is explicit about saying nice try thinking you could free yourselves by joining the british you goddamn ners
socialism,not_removed,i remember having a similar discussion with somebody who said that being loud and confrontational just alienates bystanders being loud and confrontational is bad apparently and so is quietly sitting anything other than active enthusiastic support of the entire state is enough to get you branded a wildeyed maniac in the eyes of the media
socialism,not_removed,well francis scottkey was a slave owner and rabid antiabolitionist with that context the meaning of the third verse seems pretty indisputable
socialism,not_removed,actually you could well be right the stanza could just as well be presenting a comically overexaggerated ideological contrast between freenbrave real muricans and the hirelings and slaves who make up the rest of humanity including those in the british army the beautiful thing is you wont hear this counterargument from anyone who isnt already a socialist because key makes the ideologically unfortunate for capitalists decision to directly conflate hirelings ie wage laborers with slaves granting that keys disdain for wage labor is presumably coming from a jeffersonian idealization of settlercolonial homesteading rather than from any socialist critique the stanza still presents a bit of an ideological live wire for modernday real muricans committed to the thesis that capitalism equals freedom
socialism,not_removed,i just politely remind people that if were going to say we stand for freedoms like the freedom of speech then we have to stand for it all and that if kaep exercises his speech in this way which that anthem is supposedly to stand for then really we should be applauding the act and not dismissing it with older adults who are getting bent out of shape over it i just say why do you hate freedom because thats what youre doing right now
socialism,not_removed,that was samuel johnson
socialism,not_removed,i dont know how that twitterer can be so confident that blackburn is wrong do you know of any other instance of british soldiers being referred to as hirelings and slaves heres a good summary of the controversy
socialism,not_removed,the article is talking about the slaves that worked with the british can you explain a little further how its incorrect im not parsing it from that twitter conversation and the guy seems to be talking about the civil war at this point not the war of
socialism,not_removed,nope nobody but you
socialism,not_removed,thank god someone mentioned it i thought i was going crazy
socialism,not_removed,still never got a good answer on what american culture is besides gun festishists and fried twinkies
socialism,not_removed,thats the thing with the right side of the linear spectrum irony can literally bitch slap them in the face and theyll never feel it
socialism,not_removed,i dont think they are comparable
socialism,not_removed,regionally i like his roll on columbia roll on for the pnw find myself singing it often when im missing home
socialism,not_removed,lol i just grabbed the first video i could find not sure why it has a british flag
socialism,not_removed,whats wrong with the billy bragg version
socialism,not_removed,goddammit ashokan farewell makes me tear up every time appalachian music makes me weak in the knees
socialism,not_removed,hint its right in the title
socialism,not_removed,monarchy oppressors
socialism,not_removed,referring to the british and their impressed soldiers impressment being the real cause of the war canada was definitely a side issue for hawks as slaves was common then thats also why the revolution constantly referred to them being slaves of england it is definitely disputable
socialism,not_removed,most people are profree speech until someone actually uses it nice username by the way
socialism,not_removed,this is not a good argument because then youll have to stand up for the freeze peach of racists and fascists which genuinely needs to be suppressed and fought wherever possible the best way to put it is to differentiate reactionaryracist speech and revolutionary speech not standing for the anthem is revolutionary speech while standing for it is reactionary and nationalistic
socialism,not_removed,his twitter feed actually has a bunch of other examples of writing from that period referring to the british as slaves
socialism,not_removed,his point as i understand it is that at that point in time american republicans often used the word slaves to refer to anyone who fought or laboured under a monarchy the british fit that definition particularly their army so its quite likely that that line in the song is referring to the british army
socialism,not_removed,european culture is worse what the fuck is european culture i wasnt aware the uk albania norway and belarus all shared a single culture
socialism,not_removed,guns jesus bald eagles bud light merica
socialism,not_removed,you cant be so obtuse as to think that america legitimately doesnt have a unique rich cultural and artistic history right certainly we shouldnt say there is a monolithic american culture but there are plenty of prominent cultural traditions that have their root in america
socialism,not_removed,to be fair some of your fried food is miles ahead of the rest of the world
socialism,not_removed,its because america was a melting pot not really but a better term doesnt exist i digress it hasnt existed long enough to have a culture of its own
socialism,not_removed,i meant the latest liberal party push to use gender neutral language in the national anthem
socialism,not_removed,we can use that as our anthem when we finally get an independent cascadia
socialism,not_removed,its just not as good
socialism,not_removed,ohh yes my granddad had a military burial in the lexington cemetery and one of his korea friends played the song on the harmonica and it was haunting i could talk bluegrass music all day
socialism,not_removed,when i was a frosh in high school i remember being so disgusted that this loser drop out kid would turn his back to the flag i judged him and assumed he was trashystupid it really is quite easy to fall into the reactionary crowd when looking at people who oppose something you love
socialism,not_removed,yeah somebody else also mentioned the fact that british were known for impressment and forcing citizens into military service given the context its actually pretty likely its referring to the british then at least officially why risk stirring up internal resentments when you have a perfect outsider to villainise
socialism,not_removed,european culture roughly translates from stupidese to english as things that white people do
socialism,not_removed,wearing scarves and complaining about immigrants while drinking expensive coffee on fancy public transportation fuck if i know
socialism,not_removed,im a canadian and went road tripping to vermont and upstate new york one thing i noticed about vermont burlington is that there are a surprisingly low number of american flags around then when i entered new york it was the american flag festival or something i like vermont
socialism,not_removed,yeah im not even american and i can recognize that a ton of the most important works of art of the last century or two have come out of america film literature music etc have all been hugely influenced by american works
socialism,not_removed,i hate the america has no culture circlejerk america has plenty of culutural roots and fascinating things to come out of it the antiamerican counterjerk is just really annoying
socialism,not_removed,of course it has a culture the people who mostly say it doesnt have a culture are americans who have never left america
socialism,not_removed,agreed
socialism,not_removed,i dont think making it gender neutral is comparable to trying to conceal the imperialism of the past
socialism,not_removed,cascadia represent
socialism,not_removed,but only the right white people as provided by the historically everincreasing definition of what a white people is
socialism,not_removed,yeh i find that americans are very fond of symbolism to the extent that the symbol or idea of something is more important than what is actually happening hence the major meltdown over a football player not standing and saluting the flag during the national anthem because disrespecting a piece of fabric and music is the most heinous of sins
socialism,not_removed,vermont is pretty awesome tbh although we have our fair share of crazies and a weird amount of people who weardisplay the confederate flag for whatever reason like people whose families have lived in vermont for generations
socialism,not_removed,its interesting because it used to be this heavily republican type area also it was around when bernie started winning shit that they stopped it all not saying he had any influence over all of that because i have no fuckin clue
socialism,not_removed,well i know the north country of new yorkits the deep south with snow and freezing temperatures went to plattsburgh state
socialism,not_removed,well you do looks like everyone else just wants to down vote and leave without discussing anything which is lame for this sub which constantly changes my views
socialism,not_removed,i dont either and i dont wish to imply that discussion of past imperialism or gender equality are not fundamentally important however tinkering with national anthems is the epitome of liberal nationalism a vapid timewaster for social liberals and thin gruel for those that need more from their politicians besides the only national anthem worth having has already been written sorry i didnt do intext im on mobile
socialism,not_removed,this is best emphasised by the assertations of some that muslims dont belong in europe oh alright then i guess youll be going then albania and bosnia and azerbaijan and turkey none of you are europe because youre muslims bye
socialism,not_removed,the flag cant touch the ground is that something which other nations do seems impractical
socialism,not_removed,i live in pennsylvania the confederacy literally invaded my state still rebel flags on half the pickups in my county most belonging to people whose ancestors likely volunteered for the union
socialism,not_removed,as an american living abroad i would have to argue against that perhaps the culture is not as welldefined and entrenched as say japanese culture but it is equally distinct in my opinion theres a kind of lifestyle and attitude which is american to the point that i feel suffocated by it when i visit my family because i no longer share most of it
socialism,not_removed,i live in norway and i recently saw a pick up truck with a confederate flag that was as a first
socialism,not_removed,their heritage clearly
socialism,not_removed,ive found recently that trudeau is only different than harper in terms of style not substance both of them are in favor of building pipelines despite the potential environmental repercussions both are in favor of placing troops in foreign countries both are in favor of mass surveillance both have shown support for the saudi regime and the israeli apartheid trudeau is a textbook neoliberal
socialism,not_removed,this is not good i support all first nation communities who are fighting to get rid of this we are having a similar problem here in the us with standing rock dsa stands with all first nations
socialism,not_removed,if you are in the area and hoping to get involved please go to the climate convergence facebook page or website which as i am on mobile cannot link to atm there will be a rally tonight at pst at the cbc building downtown
socialism,not_removed,curious american here what do you think is the best left counter weight or voice in opposition to trudeau the ndp greens or some other mechanism like local gov the ndp are a mystery to me also whats going on with the committee to change the voting system there
socialism,not_removed,thank you for your solidarity the protests at standing rock will definitely be a role model for us going forward as we mobilize direct action which has already begun they will not lay a foot of pipeline down
socialism,not_removed,easy on the slurs comrade but i hear ya its all for money as far as i can tell and short term gains at that too trying to hit the growing asian markets but with the rates of decline on pipelines and wells i doubt there could be any long term profits not that wed see any of the cash flow anyways theyre propogandizing the fuck out of bc too so it could help the libs provincially but i have faith in our activists and people
socialism,not_removed,do most people in bc support the pipeline i was under the impression that this would totally help the bcndp of course i thought that there was no way clark could get reelected last time around
socialism,not_removed,it really depends on the area but overall more than one would expect or hope the libs got office on a campaign of putting bc first which focused a lot on jobs especially in fossil fuels it really is tricky sometimes because you have people who may be relatively left but because of our shit housing market job market and so on are forced into these jobs or find appeal in our elite saying everything will be fixed if we can just export this oil of course our shit economy is due in part to our brazen oil subsidies and project spending and investing in renewables would launch our job market revenue etc however that was never the issue we are up against the companies whose drive for profit overshadows any sense of ethics our politicians just happen to be in their pockets in summary pipelines here are a major source of reaction and right now our biggest challenge is getting support from the working class until then while definitely being a swing issue could continue to be a draw for the libs
socialism,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpbaxjtohk about the great depression keynesianism and the postwar boom not that it matters but the speaker is a trotskyist socialist appeal capitalist crises are crises of overproduction fyi which is why wars world war specifically thought world war obviously had a similar effect were historically used to overcome crises of overproduction by destroying productive forces and thus allowing capital to be reinvested creative destruction war is no longer an option though given that nuclear weapons would result in the destruction of the human race so i have no idea how capitalism could solve future crises of overproduction or really even get out of the current recession
socialism,not_removed,while its not directly about the great depression i would strongly recommend the work of andrew kliman he has several books one addressing more directly the great recession and there are a number of videos on youtube
socialism,not_removed,check out richard wolff he occasionally talks about that in his podcasts dont have a direct link though heres a youtube video where he brings up the great depression but doesnt talk about it at length
socialism,not_removed,perpetual imperial conflict has filled this role to a significant degree breeding working class disparity in the form of eg terrorism and islamophobia along the way also the story of debt is much different than it was in wwii era introducing a whole new set of tools to hide the phenomenon of capitalist overproduction
socialism,not_removed,would a marxist view keynesianism as a positive progression towards socialism or merely an attempt by capitalists to placate the workers
socialism,not_removed,perpetual imperial conflict has filled this role to a significant degree breeding working class disparity in the form of eg terrorism and islamophobia along the way i dont think imperialism can really solve the problem of overproduction because overproduction theoretically requires the destruction of productive forces in countries all over the world or at least in many of the more productive nations and i dont think thats a realistic option whats interesting about debt is that it is only a permanent solution aswell so in order to solve the problem of overproduction people were loaded up with debt they cannot possibly repay which will inevitably lead to a massive debt crisis in the future i mean if you think debt is a problem now just give it another or years
socialism,not_removed,indeed overproduction requires the destruction of productive forces not that mass unemployment is internationally coordinated or normally distributed of course on the other end of the pole war can be seen as a massive consumption of commodities that serves to match the inevitable overproduction certainly perpetual conflict does not have the same consumption profile as a world war but the two do have some obvious similarities agreed on debt my friends here are making minimum payments on their student loans and talking about their in the same breath and im just sitting here like uhh good luck with all that
socialism,not_removed,but didnt marx believe that capitalism was a necessary step and indeed an improvement from feudalism on the way to socialism
socialism,not_removed,this scene never gets old
socialism,not_removed,currently living in illinois this is relevant
socialism,not_removed,i dont know what to say what is wrong with these people i work in an office next to a libertarian propertarian here are some quotes from him today propertarians are not libertarians property is despotism libertarians are socialists
socialism,not_removed,to be honest these american libertarians scare me more than anything else in american politics now where i live in texas they are growing in popularity mainstream media portrays gary johnson and the libertarian party as a safe alternative and as fiscally conservative and socially liberal and not as capitalist extremists which is what they are they desire openly to end entitlements minimum wages education repeal the voting rights act basically have a type of judiciary as the only real form of any government to protect private property my worry is this and other forms of the right are going to use the current situation to their advantage and mix that with american pro capitalist propaganda and they could gain ground
socialism,not_removed,sounds like my brother when people struggle its their fault because they didnt prepare or work hard enough when he has to struggle its the world out to get him
socialism,not_removed,most poor people are in poverty because they dont work hard just inherit your parents rich estate duh
socialism,not_removed,typical im not a republicanconservative im a libertarian proceeds to spew forth quintessential republican bullshit dogma but muh weed should be legal
socialism,not_removed,at one point he brings up that he grew up poor his parents made a year depending on where he grew up that might actually be poverty level my friends parents probably make about and they can barely afford their house at reduced rent
socialism,not_removed,are you taking requests for questions we can ask him through you op that would be greeat
socialism,not_removed,libertarianism is just a bullshit ideology only promoted by a tiny section of the middle class who have the most skewed fucking insane ideas about the world theres a reason why big capitalists arent libertarians because they understand that capitalism existing without the state is an absolutely ludicrous proposition the best thing you could do is to argue to them to join the union on a selfish basis i suppose as a kind of insurance on their job contract as is the reason many professional and managerial staff join their unions
socialism,not_removed,some people seem to have empathy surgically removed
socialism,not_removed,cool i know ive heard that libertarian used to be a purely socialist word but somehow it was grabbed by some other folks and has since been turned into a completely different meaning whats this propertarian term you use this is the first time ive heard it should i be using it to describe those people who call themselves libertarians is this a strike to take back the word libertarian to its original leftist definition
socialism,not_removed,okay ill say this again for the time take that shit up with all the morons infecting your party first and dont get mad at all the people who think that some ideal form of libertarianism is what is being practiced in the first world on any meaningful level
socialism,not_removed,i prefer lolbertarian
socialism,not_removed,theyre hardly even socially liberal theyre authoritarian as fuck and think the government should be able to regulate your religion your ethnicity and your political beliefs
socialism,not_removed,classic
socialism,not_removed,but you know im not a republican because i think the dopers should be able to smoke weed and fags should be able to have sex without going to jail flawless logic
socialism,not_removed,okay but based on everything else i know about this guy id say he was getting by fine
socialism,not_removed,sure go for it
socialism,not_removed,theres a reason why big capitalists arent libertarians actually one of the koch brothers ran for vicepresident in the on the libertarian ticket
socialism,not_removed,looks like one of them found his way into the comments here and is downvoting anyone who shatters his and its almost certainly a him delusions
socialism,not_removed,i know ive heard that libertarian used to be a purely socialist word but somehow it was grabbed by some other folks and has since been turned into a completely different meaning yes it was first used in a political sense by a french communist anarchist joseph dejacque whats this propertarian term you use an accurate description of their beliefs propertarians are worshipers of private property in classical liberalismwe had lifelibertyproperty when it comes to propertariansit would be propertypropertyproperty for these peopleall rights are actually property rights
socialism,not_removed,but somehow it was grabbed by some other folks and has since been turned into a completely different meaning only in the usa though theres a whole world out there where the term libertarian libertaire still holds its original meaning
socialism,not_removed,they are propertarians because they value property more than they value liberty for actual libertarians its the exact opposite liberty property
socialism,not_removed,i am a socialist and i am not an americanand even if i was an americani would never join the socalled libertarian party
socialism,not_removed,yeah for fun ask them to give you their thoughts on institutional racism or something else that ostensibly would cause them to be upset according to their ideology but you just see that look in their eyes where you know they have absolutely no conviction or passion on any level okay now tell me what you think about the flat tax pupils dilate and color rushes back to face
socialism,not_removed,true just sayin theres such a thing as houserich cashpoor
socialism,not_removed,what do you think is a more embarassing moment in us history slavery or the new deal being created and enacted
socialism,not_removed,imagine the look on his face as a surfs through comments and reads somebody find an appropriate zesty reaction gif for that
socialism,not_removed,lolbertarianism is a right wing deviation of classical liberalism
socialism,not_removed,ben carson already said that obamacare was the worst thing since slavery
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,lets be honest he probably think its worse hes just smart enough or narcissistic enough to know not to say it out loud
socialism,not_removed,perfect
socialism,not_removed,post it in the
socialism,not_removed,as a century worker and socialist why should i still be interested in building a parliamentary political organization instead of building new economic organizations among my workers inside the workplace to fight for control how is building parliamentary organizations that have sustained the capitalist state and social relationship for hundreds of years going to help me build the commune and communist social relationship in my community
socialism,not_removed,why should i still be interested in building a parliamentary political organization have you read the article the parliament isnt even mentioned once its not about parliament at all besides leftcoms are pretty much antiparliament anyway
socialism,not_removed,we absolutely need political organizations so long as we build those organizations alongside revolutionary ones and so long as both political and revolutionary organizations work in lockstep together politics is a human behavior both sociology and anthropology show us that humans have a predilection towards forming complex social structures regardless of their environment i hate to delve into naturalism but i think a case can be made that as humans we naturally tend to create groups and other social structures politics is simply the process by which groups coordinate their activities make decisions and allocate resources i absolutely loathe the kind of communists who make the ludicrous claim that a communist society would somehow be apolitical just because we have eliminated private property and classes there will still be political questions in communist societies and political organizations such as parties will naturally tend to form as a way for groups to find solutions to those questions if we arent politically organized the revolution is doomed before it even starts
socialism,not_removed,labor organizations are incredibly vulnerable without political protection
socialism,not_removed,youre correct and i jumped the gun before reading the entire article thank you for the clarification its been a long day
socialism,not_removed,i dont disagree but i dont think the political body that offers the most amount of protection to worker orgs is a political parliamentary party i think the best political body is an organized community formed into some kind of participatory body like a council or assembly that can provide material and social support to the worker orgs
socialism,not_removed,with any topic at all liberals usually believe themselves to be incredibly profound
socialism,not_removed,woah woah woah im on the left but im not that far left have you ever heard of the horseshoe theory s
socialism,not_removed,i think i know this guy is his name todd and does he work in sale
socialism,not_removed,yeah i was the same way when i was a liberal now i just avoid political discussions unless theyre one on one because most people just dont care to actually discuss rather they just talk at you
socialism,not_removed,twitch
socialism,not_removed,i do know one thing and thats that his hands are gigantic
socialism,not_removed,im sorry who are you talking about the guy in the picture
socialism,not_removed,i agree with that sentiment more and more each day
socialism,not_removed,you think thats worse my friend is part of a grassroots movement but yet wants no part in politics and then goes on talking about society i told him that the movement he is a part of is a political movement but he insists it isnt and if it was hell leave it i was in pain my friends brotherwho im grooming to become a comrade whos younger then him tried defending it but quickly realised that he was in the wrong i swear i actually think that if you put a liberal in a nazi party heshe wouldnt know uhh these are kinda racist but i respect their opinions
socialism,not_removed,i believe hes asking about the local liberal man facetiously
socialism,not_removed,it sucks too i hear people say shit and theres something deep down in me that wants to call them out every time but the effort is never worth the reward
socialism,not_removed,so love me love me love me im a liberal
socialism,not_removed,silly me
socialism,not_removed,hear hear
socialism,not_removed,shh shhh its ok we can be more more than comrades
socialism,not_removed,as gorbachev bluntly said while he was leader of the ussr the soviet union was not communist and had only managed to create a crude his word form of socialism did socialists just give up trying to fight it we should never forget that leftists in russia were under constant attack this started in when western powers invaded russia to overthrow the bolshevik regime a young churchill famously saying he wanted to strangle the baby in its cradle these attacks went on all through the ussrs history the type of skulduggery used by the uswest ranged from outright military attacks to things like the us creating an industrial explosion so large that it still ranks as one of the top nonnuclear explosions of world history thus one could understand if russians tired of the fight soviet communists tend to readily admit that they did not sufficiently push the ideological struggle which left them vulnerable to western attack or do you just see communism as a stepping stone to socialism no the above is backwards socialism is a stepping stone to a communal society i feel betrayed by the west the opportunity we seized on behalf of peace has been lost former ussr leader mikhail gorbachev from a interview
socialism,not_removed,it depends what concept you are trying to communicate with the term socialism i dont think anyone is under the illusion that the law of value etc ceased to function in the ussr and class and state were abolished many people use socialism to describe this scenario but i am totally comfortable in saying that throughout the world various proletarian revolutions took place and certain states were under proletarian control at times it even looked like certain groups of proletarians in various regions were leading the way to a classless stateless valueless society
socialism,not_removed,this should be a fun thread it really depends on who you ask and how youre defining the terms if you define socialism as the workers directly controlling the means of production mop then the ussr and china arent likely to be called socialist states does the party or the state controlling the mop count as socialism depends on who you ask one thing we can all agree on i hope is that none of them were communist states for obvious reasons there are also debates about what kind of transitional state or dictatorship of the proletariat marx envisioned a lot of communists disagree with the idea that the transitional state has to be the way it was in the ussr and they clamor for a more direct democratic state httpslibcomorglibrarykarlmarxstate discusses marxs conception of the state in detail you might find this useful
socialism,not_removed,lots of debate there i think that the ussr yugoslavia china vietnam etc were socialist in a fashion but just because they were socialist does not mean they are above criticism as for the difference between communism and socialism basically communism is the end result of socialism no socialist country has gotten close to it its a misnomer to call places like the ussr and china communist even though they were run by communist parties
socialism,not_removed,some people say it was some people say it wasnt but does it really matter if they were socialist theres nothing stopping you from calling yourself a socialist and wanting something different if they were socialist and you believe they were terrible that is no reason to support capitalism there are other things to consider here aside from labels
socialism,not_removed,lol this is the one question that guarantees a sectarian shitshow
socialism,not_removed,us mls mlm define socialism as the dictatorship of the proletariat the transition between capitalism and communism as an mlm the ussr was socialist until the death of josef stalin imo china was socialist until maos death as well imo
socialism,not_removed,yes i would say they were socialist i think the great mistake that was made was that they reached about where complete and total state ownership was becoming a drag on the economy but werent sure how to proceed
socialism,not_removed,no the state owned the means of production not the people
socialism,not_removed,richard wolff and others have a paper on this that discusses what they believe it was state captialism workers did not own the means of production we disagree with this conventional understanding of the last centurys tensions and con flicts between nations aligned in the contending capitalist and communist blocs we find that the struggle did not pit capitalism against communism this conclusion flows from the fact that communism – if understood as a distinct noncapitalist class structure – was never a significant nor a sustained part of the history of any of the nations conventionally labeled communist using the ussr and prc as exemplars we will argue below that those nations actually displayed capitalist and feudal not communist class structures we do not doubt the sincere marxist consciousness and anticapitalist commitment of the revolutionaries who inaugurated the ussr and prc however notwithstanding their battles to establish and defend socialism and to move toward communism they could not and did not install communist class structures as the prevailing social organi zation of production in either country instead they established particular state forms ofcapitalism and stateforms of feudalism as means to improve their nations economic and military strength and their citizens standards of living thus by the second half of the century the dominant conflicts occurred among mostly private capitalisms the us western europe japan etc a state capitalism in the ussr and eastern europe and first a state feudalism and then a state capitalism in the prc
socialism,not_removed,no russia was never socialist it wasnt in a transition to communism httpwwwmarxisthumanistinitiativeorgtagtransitionalsociety the idea of a transition is just a later excuse dreamt up to cover the capitalist and counterrevolutionary nature of the russian state which they then try to pass off with the excuse of material conditions ask them about revisionists and be amazed when they unironically tell you about how they revised theory in order to say how the states they ruled over were socialist workers were stripped of power strikes were broken up and their political organs devoid of proletarian content there was a constant struggle with the workers like in any capitalist economy to get them to be more productive in order to extract from surplusvalue from them draconian labour laws were introduced and management skills from the more advanced capitalist states were imported in russia the economy was driven by profit the state ran enterprises were encouraged in fact they were legally obliged to make a profit and a capitalist enterprise makes a profit by exploiting the proletariat which was then taxed by the state and then the commodities being bought were also taxed with the actual burden of tax being on the proletariat in the form of necessities being taxed more than industrial items the development of russian capitalism followed the outlines of other capitalist developments the creation of a majority proletarian class with the combined generalisation of wagelabour and commodity production the law of value determined the economy evening affecting the price of commodities and what was produced in the country you had the situation of property being legally enshrined the collective farms were ran as private businesses and you got the situation where collective farmers were becoming millionaires the collective farmers were also entitled to their own private plots which they of course paid more attention to and were free to sell the produce from them tax free where they could speculate on the market and invest on their own plots it got to the point where private plots while accounting for a very small proportion of the land accounted for a huge chunk of the agricultural output sometimes exceeding here are some easy to read texts on the subject from raya dunayevskaya and one from il programa comunista httpwwwsinistranetlibprowhyrusnsochtml and theres also a list of other works the other countries that people call socialist have even less reason to call themselves socialist in comparison to russia
socialism,not_removed,this is a topic of much hatred debate among those who call themselves socialist anarchist or communist marxistleninists tend to defend countries like cuba ussr and dprk although we realize that there are valid criticisms and we should be frank about them however most critiques leveled at socialist countries are based on misinformation and sometimes outright lies often created by imperialist and reactionary forces who are directly invested in maintaining global capitals grip on property and land unfortunately in the west most of what you learn in schools about socialist countries is simply not true id encourage you to check out rcommunism and their debunking anticommunism master post
socialism,not_removed,in my opinon no if a socialistsocial revolution breaks out the result isnt automatically socialism this is why we so often talk about building socialism the rsfsr in its early years and parts of the russian republic were trying to build socialism meaning workers control abolition of private property and so on this evolution came to a brutal halt when war communism was declared and the party itself began organizing crackdowns on striking workers and saboteurs a ruling bureaucratic caste formed they held political power trotsky claims that they were not a true ruling class at this point as they did not hold control over economic life the soviet union in his view was a workers state until stalin gained full control of the party and the bureaucracy began casting out dissidents accusing them of factionalism in some cases the country then became a degenerated workers state a kind of political limbo that would either be put back on the path to socialism by the workers or would collapse back into capitalism through a capitalist revolution which is bascially what happened in the final days of the ussr revolutions that strived towards a stalinist model implemented a deformed workers state a system that seeks to transition to this form of state immediately after the revolution seeing this as socialism disclaimer this is the orthodox trotskyist view other trotskyists and many other marxists hold that the soviet union became state capitalist but i have a serious problem with the word capitalist here as markets were basically nonexistent in the ussr or that they had a system of bureaucratic collectivism which i think is a pretty bad description of the ussr but may well apply to north korea
socialism,not_removed,a copy pasta i made for this question in lenins words the state capitalism which is one of the principal aspects of the new economic policy is under soviet power a form of capitalism that is deliberately permitted and restricted by the working class our state capitalism differs essentially from the state capitalism in countries that have bourgeois governments in that the state with us is represented not by the bourgeoisie but by the proletariat who has succeeded in winning the full confidence of the peasantry the soviet never became socialist or communist if you want to go to mars you should probably land on the moon first in the same way you need to achieve capitalism before you can achieve socialism state capitalism was supposed to be a transition from semifeudalism to socialism that wasnt as exploitative as bourgeois capitalism state capitalism would be a step forward as compared with the present state of affairs in our soviet republic if in approximately six months time state capitalism became established in our republic this would be a great success and a sure guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a permanently firm hold and will have become invincible in this country socialism never took hold in the su lenin never called the su for socialistat least not what i can find it wasnt before stalin came to power that the su openly declared themselves to have achieved socialismmostly too boost moral its not exactly shameful to think that the su was socialist or communist considering the two greatest propaganda superpowers both called the su for communist but for two totally different reasons it started off as a state capitalist nation with a ruling party whos ideology was communism and it never evolved beyond that
socialism,not_removed,in a word no i dont think i can put it any better than chomsky so ill just leave it to him it is clear enough why both major propaganda systems insist upon this fantasy since its origins the soviet state has attempted to harness the energies of its own population and oppressed people elsewhere in the service of the men who took advantage of the popular ferment in russia in to seize state power one major ideological weapon employed to this end has been the claim that the state managers are leading their own society and the world towards the socialist ideal an impossibility as any socialist — surely any serious marxist — should have understood at once many did and a lie of mammoth proportions as history has revealed since the earliest days of the bolshevik regime the taskmasters have attempted to gain legitimacy and support by exploiting the aura of socialist ideals and the respect that is rightly accorded them to conceal their own ritual practice as they destroyed every vestige of socialism as for the worlds second major propaganda system association of socialism with the soviet union and its clients serves as a powerful ideological weapon to enforce conformity and obedience to the state capitalist institutions to ensure that the necessity to rent oneself to the owners and managers of these institutions will be regarded as virtually a natural law the only alternative to the socialist dungeon the soviet leadership thus portrays itself as socialist to protect its right to wield the club and western ideologists adopt the same pretense in order to forestall the threat of a more free and just society this joint attack on socialism has been highly effective in undermining it in the modern period
socialism,not_removed,لا
socialism,not_removed,it is socialism at the beginning and it is operated as a socialist state for a long timebut it dose have a lot problems inside the government by the time goes on those problems like a snowball become bigger and bigger finally drive this country into a authoritarian regime one of the biggest problem i think is this country do not have a powerful and self organized working class marx said a socialist state should like a union of freemen every union and factory were found and control by the state when state run the factory socialistic and democratic it is a socialist factory but when the government decided not to do this workers have no choice but to follow the order
socialism,not_removed,they were more socialist than the west at least after stalin who in my opinion was more of a fascist than anything but it was crude socialism the ussr china and there little buddies have likely actually set back leftist movements by a couple decades
socialism,not_removed,well of course gorbachev would say that he was was trying to transform the ussr into a social democracy
socialism,not_removed,not trying to defend krushchev but i dont feel its necessarily correct to describe his rule as capitalist who owned the means of production did workers bust out and demand his hanging the way the chinese workers did with deng i mean yeah hes a revisionist but at least he didnt allow for the whole return of capitalism which the kosigyn reforms of practically did i mean a lot of the stuff mao did was revisionist his domestic polives were rocksolid under his leadership the landlords and other parasites were expropriated and destroyed but a lot of his foriegn policy was hypocritical he proclaimed the right of every people and every nation to selfdetermination as every good marxisleninist does however in between allying with bhuttos pakistan or the bangladesh people who did mao align with thats right pakistan even as their army killed up to million bangladesh people in a campaign of genocide during the liberation war no this was a completely incorrect solution of the national question revisionist even does it make him a capitalist every revisionist is not necessarily a capitalist
socialism,not_removed,well technically speaking the ussr and china had democratic elements yeah the average worker couldnt decide how mao or krushchev is running the five year plan but they could vote for representatives in their local soviet dunno what the chinese term for this was in maos day who would then participate in the state not perfect but certainly not wholly undemocratic
socialism,not_removed,i hated my old comments so ive replaced them all using the reddit overwrite tampermonkey script
socialism,not_removed,but just because they were socialist does not mean they are above criticism very true but still we must learn to prioritize our criticism given the wanton crimes of the west and the immoral imperial basis for our society criticizing socialist countries while not verboten should be way down on the list of our priorities considering the routine atrocities committed by the usnatowest
socialism,not_removed,its a pretty important distinction when making your point that you support socialism to be able to accurately describe what that entails the op thinks he might support socialism but he clearly doesnt know the definition of either communism or socialism the same way we dont want detractors misrepresenting socialism we should apply the same standard to would be supporters misrepresenting socialism as a supporter can also be damaging
socialism,not_removed,oh but its so fun
socialism,not_removed,i mostly agree but i should point out that its somewhat coincidental that socialism and the trajectory towards communism ended with stalins and maos deaths if they lived years longer socialism wouldnt continue years longer
socialism,not_removed,i guess the proletariat are not that important
socialism,not_removed,is the state a magical being is it a classless body which class controls the state at any given time period in ontario the state controls liquor sales but there should be no ambiguity liquor sales are a capitalist enterprise under control of the bourgeoisie
socialism,not_removed,by that logic our current government isnt owned by the bourgoisie
socialism,not_removed,the historian in me wretches a bit when i read that post it uses unreliable and iirc rather outdated sources to string together an argument against an imaginary strawman worse the way its presented leaves a lot of room to make completely ahisotrical leapseg from the position that the holodmer wasnt strictly intentional a shaky position albeit one that some mainstream historians still hold to the position that the state wasnt responsible for the holodmer a position easily disproven through primary sources things get worse when you scroll down to the north korea section like counterpunch worse while there are myths flouted about stereotyping the people of north korea in racist fashion its really not a nice place to live while i agree that most of what we learned in high school is propaganda rcommunism really isnt the best source for historical information
socialism,not_removed,my greatest influence is george orwell you mean the guy who ratted on communists to the british government
socialism,not_removed,to quote myself from another comment i posted on this same thread while some point to the nep as proof of state capitalism these claims are disingenuous the nep was a policy change not a systemic one like the revolution or a shift in political power from one class to another its best described as a strategic retreat that was seen as necessary to build and rebuild industry destroyed in the civil war
socialism,not_removed,or how the us caused the most monumental nonnuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space in the summer of in order to disrupt the soviet gas supply its hard currency earnings from the west and the internal russian economy the pipeline software that was to run the pumps turbines and valves was programmed to go haywire after a decent interval to reset pump speeds and valve settings to produce pressures far beyond those acceptable to pipeline joints and welds mr reed writes the project exceeded the cias wildest dreams its interesting to note that the siberian gas line explosion used to be covered by wikipedia in most of the pages you expected it to be written about not any more though which is not surprising given wikipedias anticommunist libertarian political leanings and its importance as a propaganda platform
socialism,not_removed,thats mostly true but the fact remains that no matter what russia did including breaking their country up into over a dozen countries and converting their economy to capitalism nothing would stop the angloamericanwestern empires aggression one could honestly say gorbachevs move to end the cold war was bold and daring naive and based on moral logic sure but still bold daring and ultimately fruitless
socialism,not_removed,well most of them were state socialist that is a workers state was in charge of the means of production rather than the workers themselveswell yugoslavia is an outlier on that list however the problem then becomes how democratic that workers state is which is usually not enough
socialism,not_removed,criticizing socialist countries while not verboten should be way down on the list of our priorities considering the routine atrocities committed by the usnatowest i see what youre saying but i think we should be very cautious about this kind of mentality for a number of reasons thats the exact same mentality westerners use to justify the atrocities committed by their countries hey sure it was bad but we had no choice do you want the commies to win we should strive to be much better than just not as bad as just because were doing better doesnt mean were doing as well as we could and should be selfcriticism is an essential tool to the success of our movement obviously no country is perfect and obviously difficult conditions force countries into difficult situations and tough choices but that doesnt mean that we should be making excuses just because the atrocities are being committed in the name of our ideology and not theirs
socialism,not_removed,socialism has been redefined so many times its ridiculous to talk about misrepresenting it on top of that different socialists will tell you it means different things mlms will tell you its the dictatorship of the proletariat left communists will tell you its the same thing as communism democratic socialists will tell you a variety of things conservatives and liberals will tell you its state ownership whos to say whos right and whos wrong better to focus on what you believe and what you want than to defend a label
socialism,not_removed,i cant help but read these weekly threads
socialism,not_removed,sorry but can you reword that i dont really understand
socialism,not_removed,i should point out that its somewhat coincidental that socialism and the trajectory towards communism ended with stalins and maos deaths lol just coincidental huh so what do you consider the immediate post stalin period to not be socialist is socialism only a matter of who is sitting in the kremlin
socialism,not_removed,i dont believe that there death caused the end of socialism rather that it marked where it roughly ended
socialism,not_removed,after some discussion i believe a number of things caused socialism and the dotp to end the threat of invasion from liberalcapitalist countries class struggle not advanced under socialism in the su in china the cultural revolution not going far enough in china the conflict with the soviet union under corn lover in the su lack of movements from the masses and relying on top down purges
socialism,not_removed,but they didnt though the cpsu had control over the state
socialism,not_removed,im not sure why you are trying to get people to give you exact definitions when you give this it depends what concept you are trying to communicate with the term socialism i dont think anyone is under the illusion that the law of value etc ceased to function in the ussr and class and state were abolished many people use socialism to describe this scenario where you have just effectively described a capitalist economy and called it socialism
socialism,not_removed,the state didnt represent the people it only claimed to
socialism,not_removed,i disagree there are some lessthanreliable articles on that masterpost but then again there are a few articles which are incredibly wellresearched and take the position of disproving anticommunist claims grover furr yes i know most historians think he has no credibility does this by actually looking for the primary sources in russian and finds that many of them simply dont exist or are based on shoddy evidence the claim that the holodomor was intentional or even a result of collectivization policies also lacks much evidence to support it one thing i notice even from historians is that they tend to dismiss the fact that there were famines occurring regularly in ukraine well before and in fact the famine was the very last until after because nazis destroyed much of the soviet countryside and infrastructure in addition to the soviets being under sanctions was also the year that stalin started collectivization in ukraine i find it interesting that famines ended after collectivization as far as the dprk goes there is much to say about it they are obviously extremely poor but why are they poor they have a militaryfirst policy but why they have tough labor prisons but who goes there and why i find that nobody really takes the time to actually analyze the material conditions of a society before critiquing the society itself when it comes to socialist countries the massive and incredible gains are ignored in favor if a distorted view influenced by imperialist propaganda and bourgeois media both of which are directly invested in destroying socialism wherever it arises we need more nuance in our analysis and just because a few defectors had some wild things to say about the dprk it does not mean we should take them at face value remember that many defectors actually choose to return to the dprk their side of things is often ignored the same can be said of cuba only the dissidents point of view is given any credence in the west and we have been exposed to an incredibly distorted view of how things really are
socialism,not_removed,so what caused the ussr to become socialist in your opinion the five year plan
socialism,not_removed,so after lenin died and stalin took over you are saying that the five year plans where a systematic change or what is your point that my argument is invalid because the ussr suddenly achieved socialism after lenin died
socialism,not_removed,unless hardcore marxists managed to seize the state in the and had popular support decades of economic warfare western infiltration pretty sure yelstin was funded by the west like milosevic and general strife would have certainly led to capitalisms restoration
socialism,not_removed,as far as i know there is only one definition worker control of the means of production how thats accomplished may vary but it doesnt change the definition
socialism,not_removed,i know exactly whats going to happen but i click anyway
socialism,not_removed,so socialism ended approximately but if stalin lived until socialism would have still ended in if stalin died in socialism would have still lasted until
socialism,not_removed,this is specifically what im saying is not true socialism ends whether stalin lives longer or passes away sooner im literally saying that socialism is not a matter of who is sitting in the kremlin
socialism,not_removed,the real end of socialism in these countries wasnt the death of this or that leader it was the failure of the socialistproletarian line to win out within the party andor state as a whole leading to the victory of the capitalistbourgeois line
socialism,not_removed,orkers in the city which had supposedly suffered at least as much as any other in the great terror were still able to criticize a director to his face and apparently to get a job back after cursing a supervisor while sane calm and sober no worker would have dared to say that socialism was a poor system or that stalin was an idiot but such bounds allowed a great deal that was deeply significant to workers including some aspects of production norms pay rates and classifications safety on the job housing and treatment by managers robert thurston reassessing the history of soviet workers and for a more in depth example throughout the summer of the unions held multicandidate secretballot elections at every level from the factory to the central committees the workers took up the campaign for union democracy and swept out the old apparat in one election after another a report from the woolen workers union to the vtssps optimistically noted work in the factories has completely changed its face for the first time in years woolen workers actively participated in large noisy accountability meetings of the more than people elected to factory committees in the woolen industry percent were new and percent had never participated in union activities they voted out about half of the old factory committee chairmen and elected more than people to shop committees and another as shop organizers the sheer numbers of new participants pointed to a major overhaul of the union in the red weaving factory about onesixth of the workers were elected to shop committees an unprecedented level of voluntary participation paid officials were eliminated from the shops and replaced with volunteers the factory committee began meeting regularly to discuss living conditions in august the woolen workers held their first congress with delegates after sharply criticizing the members of the unions central committee for their phony performances poor leadership and deep violations of union democracy the delegates voted them out of office only four previous members were reelected stakhanovite workers from the shop floor composed almost half of the new central committee it promptly created labor protection commissions to improve ventilation record accidents provide work clothes and monitor overtime work the electoral shakeup in the woolen workers union was replicated in other unions through the fall of and into the winter unions held congresses attended by more than delegates they were turbulent affairs using the language of democracy and purge the delegates strongly criticized the existing central committees and unmasked an entire series of individuals in leadership positions who were politically blind and careless as well as a number of corrupt elements idlers and bureaucrats the blame game spread like wildfire at the congresses each layer of leadership criticized the one above it delegates from the railroad construction union criticized their central committee the central committee of the union of central cooperative employees criticized its presidium union members from electric power stations peat bogs schools and dining halls denounced their officials for bureaucracy separation from the masses and ignoring the needs of their members wendy z goldman stalinist terror and democracy the union campaign so democracy in the ussr certainly wasnt the best it couldve been but as far as workers control went it was by far the most advanced society in the world consider the stance international workers movement in the where in america the democratic alternative httpsenwikipediaorgwikiharlancountywar were being fought just for the right to organize workers into unions the main qualitative difference between capitalist countries like the usa and socialist ones like the ussr was that in the ussr with proletarian politics in command production was centered on creating usevalues over exchangevalues while in the usa with bourgeois politics in command production was centered on creating exchangevalues with usevalues being considered only so that commodities would actually be sold in other words the ussr during this time focused on production for the needs of people and society as a whole not profits for a select few of course as a maoist i believe that the albeit minimal socialist construction that occurred in the ussr was ultimately overturned and reversed after when khrushchev backed by the petitbourgeois classes still existing in the ussr gained power effectively through a coup but thats besides the point i also believe that china during the cultural revolution made it much further than the soviet union in regards to workers control and democracy mostly because of the ability to learn from the soviet experience but ive probably spent enough time talking about the ussr here besides the things i cited here i would recommend checking out soviet democracy by pat sloan state and society under stalin constitutions and elections in the by j arch getty the stalin era by anna louise strong life and terror in stalins russia by robert thurston soviet communism a new civilization by beatrice and sidney webb if youre having trouble finding any of these online message me and i can give you a pdf from drive also sorry that this was so long i wanted to be thorough lol
socialism,not_removed,these are partially transformed by the existence of a workers state through the action of a ruling workers party and in particular through the role played by the workers party and the trade unions within the enterprise however this rule can only be partial since a real transformation requires among other things the substitution of new ideological and political relations for the old relations that is an ideological revolutionization of the workers which makes them assert themselves as the masters of production charles bettelheim economic calculation and forms of property a workers state for our purposes the ideological and repressive state apparatuses which serve the proletariat in its longterm goals of abolishing class society is necessary not only for its repressive apparatuses against the bourgeoisie defending from foreign imperialists internal counterrevolutionaries and stamping out emerging capitalist forms such as black markets and ideological apparatuses education politicslegislature propaganda etc but as the first leap forward in revolutionizing social relations of course the creation of a workers state with concurrent state control over production and distribution is not the only step necessary in building communism there is a need for further changes to occur both on the level of factories and farms and throughout society as a whole these transformations were insufficiently developed in the ussr yes but that doesnt mean there was no worker control over production in other words nationalization of the means of production by a proletarian state results first and foremost in the creation of politicojuridical conditions favorable to the socialist transformation of production relations and to the socialization of the means of production but it is not to be identified with this transformation charles bettleheim class struggles in the ussr pg the ussr probably experienced the greatest amount of direct unadulterated workers control in the years immediately following the revolution before war communism really took effect and reinstituted management in enterprises in an effort to increase productivity for the war this doesnt mean that workers control in this period was especially good however since private enterpriseproperty was still in the process of being nationalized and taken over by peasants workers and the red guardsred army which was pretty much entirely made up of peasants and workers except for the royalist generals who were training them in these early days under careful watch of course second production was almost entirely concentrated in cities and the soviets were scattered and atomized with no connecting body the soviets that did exist were still incredibly inefficient as well the efforts of workers control never spread much to other industries either since soon after the revolution governing bodies like the sovnarkom advocated for less control of the soviets and more control in the hands of the trade unions again in efforts to increase production these efforts unsurprisingly to us now didnt do much to actually increase production and exemplified the first major error of the soviet government putting production over the revolutionizing of social relations of course this was during a time of civil war and famine so its understandable why this error was made while these moves were understandable at the time they were implemented they werent reversed in the period after war communism the new economic program and moves against management and the bourgeois forms which still existed in the ussr werent made again until the first five year plan after the soviet union abolished the nep and while some point to the nep as proof of state capitalism these claims are disingenuous the nep was a policy change not a systemic one like the revolution or a shift in political power from one class to another its best described as a strategic retreat that was seen as necessary to build and rebuild industry destroyed in the civil war this was drawn out for too long and led to a sharpening of class struggle after the nep ended and i would argue not incredibly necessary in the first place since it increased power of kulaks and managers but we cant change history and hindsight is workers control in the ussr especially the early ussr was incredibly difficult to maintain due to the problems in society the few scattered factories before the revolution the destruction of industry agriculture and communication during the civil war the lack of education and low literacy rate of many workers and the necessity of a plan to build industry and defense against capitalist powers seen as imperative after the civil war were all more imperative at the time we have to analyze the soviet union as it really was after all and not how it failed to live up to fairly utopian standards that being said the ussr wasnt some democracyless wasteland with no workers control for example in the government abolished the existing national department of labor and turned its functions over to the allunion central council of trade unions it being taken for granted in a socialist regime that no group in the country is more competent or trustworthy to administer the nations labor laws than those persons most directly concerned the workers themselves william z foster american trade unionism p workers participated in the hundreds of thousands in special inspectorates commissions and brigades which checked the work of managers and institutions theses agencies sometimes wielded substantial power the stakhanovite movement was not a crude bludgeon used to beat all workers into vastly greater production despite the drive to raise norms however it did accomplish something else for the industrial labour force which was of grave importance the movement provided new status for workers in voicing criticism urging and even demanding changes in production processes and getting supervisors attention in general new forums appeared in which stakhanovites could speak out while some old and weak mechanisms for input now revived worker enthusiasm was essential to boosting productivity in order to help whip up zeal the party leaders were quite willing to encourage workers to speak out workers needed to feel that the stakhanovite movement was theirs in a meaningful way
socialism,not_removed,the state and class dont magically vanish after the proletariat gains political power that takes a much longer and more active struggle against both the bourgeois class and bourgeois forms in society such as the law of value commodity production and private property the struggle against these economic forms relations and classes and for the revolutionizing of social relations towards communism is best defined as the dictatorship of the proletariat or the first stage of communism or socialism really at that point it becomes a semantics thing more than anything
socialism,not_removed,yes it did
socialism,not_removed,i actually agree with a lot of the masterposts claimsmost of the articles on cuba for example are wellresearched as you say but that doesnt excuse the ludicrous and offensive holodomor denialism on that sub of the contemporary historians who have studied the topic and here i am defining contemporary as since roughly the vast majority agree that stalins policies turned what would have been a shortfall into a massive famine mark tauger and grover furr make the understandable but ultimately damning errors of failing to account for population fluctuation and misrepresenting the scale of prestalinist shortfalls leaving them with a holodomor that if the numbers are fudged a little and the right sources called into question looks natural rather than an obvious result of soviet economic policy as for the dprk i will say this i agree that we need more nuance that does not change the fact that their government routinely commits acts and admits to doing so which far exceed the immorality of those committed by other noncapitalist states
socialism,not_removed,no like the implementation of the nep the abolition of the nep and start of five year plans were also policy changes not systemic ones or ones that constituted a shift in the political power of a particular class bourgeoisie to proletariat or vice versa the ussr was a dictatorship of the proletariat throughout the nep it was state capitalist in that the state acted as a capitalist in relation to rich peasants but it still had proletarian politics in command that is the state still had a genuinely proletarian character like i said it was a strategic retreat in order to rebuild infrastructure and production destroyed in the civil war this has a very different quality than state capitalism in which the state acted as a capitalist in relation to society and had bourgeois politics in command such as when khrushchevs clique took over and the capitalist line effectively won the struggle within the state another clearer example of this would be the difference between the new democracy period of history in the prc and the history of the prc since the postmao economic reforms socialism is not something that is achieved it is the transitory society during which capitalist relations and forms are destroyed and revolutionized into communist relations and forms this depends on the twoline struggle within society between capitalists reactionaries and the proletariat revolutionaries httpwwwprisoncensorshipinfoarchivebookscapitalistroadershtml is a good read on the theory and history of twoline struggle with a focus on china
socialism,not_removed,is this a meme or something
socialism,not_removed,i gave you three groups who define it differently the french socialist louis blanc in called socialism the organization of labor bakunin called socialism justice and he called justice equity so no there is not only one definition
socialism,not_removed,but i click anyway what a savage
socialism,not_removed,i think if youre looking for a date that marks when capitalism has been restored in the soviet union its the party congress of the communist party in where chruschtschow and his followers really took power there has been a series of strikes and protests against that capitalist coup détat but they were suppressed very violent of course this date has a long history
socialism,not_removed,why did stalin abandon socialist goals ten years before his death
socialism,not_removed,im just sitting here not thinking that it ended until the
socialism,not_removed,thank you very much for the indepth well researched response
socialism,not_removed,and these practices increased under khrushchev and brezhnev
socialism,not_removed,in what ways do population fluctuation affect the famines in what way does the lesser scale of previous famines affect the greater scale of the famine there were other factors involved besides just stalins collectivization policies remember during that time there were many sanctions enforced on the soviet union some of which included only allowing them to trade grain for agricultural machinery from a completely objective standpoint and taking into considerations the biases of both sides of this argument it seems more likely that the soviet government just wasnt wellequipped enough to handle the famine of during the time it happened but once collectivization was fully implemented by we didnt see another famine until the late which was in large part thanks to the nazis destruction of soviet infrastructure and farms as far as the dprk goes i dont think theyve actually admitted to committing any seriously horrible immoral crimes the only evidence we have are defectors which considering how deeply impoverished the country is and how desperate some of those people are to find some kind of prosperity and stability should be viewed with skepticism i wonder how much money some of these defectors make in making such statements to western media vilifying socialist countries is a timehonored tradition of capitalist and fascist states its how weve been able to justify every military intervention since in postrevolution socialist states collectivization and policies similar to it have resulted in an end to hunger in as far as i have researched every socialist country to ever pop into existence we can see this in the dprk itself who after the collapse of the soviet union suffered from a horrible famine which lasted for some time it was only after a reinvestment in agriculture and full collectivization that the people of dprk are no longer starving yes they may not be getting all the necessary food they need to live a healthy prosperous life but this could be easily remedied by the lifting of trade sanctions even china enforces some restrictions against the dprk this only reinforces how important internationalism is to building socialism when a socialist country is left on its own they can get by but only just when they can trade and share scientific knowledge with the rest of the world they can prosper as for the militaryfirst policy which deserves criticism its a lot more tricky and as you said requires more nuance its important to understand how devoted the us has been to destroying them since theyre still technically at war as a peace treaty was never signed given that the us has a long history of infiltration and sabotage it makes sense that the dprk would be extra tough on ensuring no such activities take place are they always moral no and they arent always right this is a valid criticism but it must be taken into full context with its relation with global capitalist superpowers
socialism,not_removed,hmm wasnt aware of those definitions they seem to nebulous to represent an ethos though fair point regardless
socialism,not_removed,the absolute madman
socialism,not_removed,im pretty sure krushchev didnt completely consolidate his power until
socialism,not_removed,because class struggle is bigger than stalin
socialism,not_removed,i would say worker control is just as nebulous reactionaries and some socialists have taken this to mean that state ownership with governmental democracy is worker control and therefore socialism but many would still disagree that state ownership is consistent with socialism certainly if the state is exploiting the working class than the outcome is the same regardless of how much control the workers have
socialism,not_removed,ah because stalin didnt advance class struggle under socialism
socialism,not_removed,in leninism the workers control the state so
socialism,not_removed,i mean he helped like most of the progressive people did but hes just one man
socialism,not_removed,in theory anyway not so much in fact but whatever if you read when i wrote youll notice that i already mentioned that reactionaries and some socialists have taken this to mean that state ownership with governmental democracy is worker control and therefore socialism emphasis added
socialism,not_removed,ah the great man theory my apologies comrade may i ask for insight on what leads to revisionists taking power like what material conditions what do you believe we can do to stop it
socialism,not_removed,so soviets workers councils dont real
socialism,not_removed,yeah i wasnt being clear but you get it oh man thats such a huge topic im not totally convinced by any of the typical answers but i think theres a lot of truth to many of them i mean cold war russian nationalism lack of cultural revolution
socialism,not_removed,their existence doesnt mean much if theyre dictated to by the state
socialism,not_removed,they werent statecontrolled workers could vote for representatives to make decisions in the supreme soviet as well
socialism,not_removed,is that what wikipedia told you
socialism,not_removed,no jackass thats what researching the subject told me
socialism,not_removed,ajamu
socialism,not_removed,if anyone is interested ive met and talked to jill stein she signed my copy of the communist manifesto when she came to my city a few weeks ago
socialism,not_removed,baraka is the most hilariously open marxist without ever labeling himself a marxist
socialism,not_removed,thanks for posting this really hoping he and jill stein can get to so the green party gets funding next time
socialism,not_removed,did he talk about how he thinks everything is a cia false flag
socialism,not_removed,sounds good his foreign policy is a little conspiratorial but thats not rare on the left
socialism,not_removed,hey guys can we discuss a little bit the ama by jill stein from yesterday i think on many issues she showed to be far superior than her neoconneoliberal alternatives now the amount of people coming out and debunking her nuclear fission positions was astonishing and even if you assume that of these are shilling redditors who watched too much daily show or last week tonight there was still a lot of detailed negative responses from apparent science insiders on top of that i am not too familiar with the history of nuclear power and safety issues in usa as far as france and germany go i know that french reactors every now and then have to run emergency protocols that make it to the press in some foggy way and that the german storages are leaking and by no means undisputed i would like some neutral perspective on which of her views are righteous concerns and which are unscientific esoteric hippybeliefs
socialism,not_removed,did you ask him why he hangs out with holocaust denialists and when prodded by one radio host agreed with him that theres a jewish conspiracy that runs the world
socialism,not_removed,jill stein and co are still better than the opposition but i think we should be wary shes said some cooky pseudosciencey things that kind of scare me
socialism,not_removed,it appears like there is a huge divide in the green party where no one really seems divided between those who are more liberal in their way of thinking and those who place the blame on capitalism it really is though although the gpus passed an amendment to become anticapitalist and somewhat antistate early this year there was still opposition to it i dont even think it passed by that large of a margin i just hope those liberals really open themselves up to real solutions rather than biding the time with current bourgeoisie politics
socialism,not_removed,amaju baraka is much more interesting and a much better speaker than jill stein imo
socialism,not_removed,i voted for steinbaraka while understanding that our twoparty institution makes it nigh impossible for a third candidate to win i just went with it to add some kind of boost to the alternative voice stein is certainly not the perfect candidate i find her views on biotech and nuclear power to be problematic but hell it wasnt like i was expecting a victory
socialism,not_removed,sounds like a good time i had never heard of him before this election still relatively new to all of this but i really enjoy hearing what he has to say i voted for jill stein but i always thought that she needed a really good speech writer though her positions in and of themselves are very radical to the average american voter i think a writer like chris hedges would really have helped her campaign but im just some random person on the internet with an opinion haha
socialism,not_removed,what were your thoughts on her she really rubs me the wrong way i guess its because she is a politician and is always trying to garner support but she really just seems like a liberal to me i do of course recognize that political consciousness revolves around presidential elections so i guess it makes some sense but i often think that she compromises in the wrong areas
socialism,not_removed,is that not a reasonable thing to think
socialism,not_removed,can you elaborate a little on this
socialism,not_removed,i saw those replies in that ama and for the first time saw some credence to her caricature as an antiscience panderer i think a fair amount of posters were not shills as well its nonetheless strange how people fetishize science so much that a slightly objectionable position like we shouldnt use nuclear power becomes their one criteria for voting in a race against trump and hillary i can rationalize her socalled pandering as a necessary evil to retain a base of support from the loony fringe i think shell correct these positions as she gains steam
socialism,not_removed,arent the mining of radioactive materials and the storage of waste much bigger problems than rare catastrophic failures anyway edit was already mentioned oops
socialism,not_removed,nuclear has problems which make it pretty unnecessary imo when compared with making renewable energy a priority if the government could be made to make this a priority which obviously it should then nuclear isnt really something we should be bothering with see nuclear waste finite quantities of uranium the ecological impact of uranium mining high start up cost etc
socialism,not_removed,i personally would support the kind of nuclear power that france uses as a transitional pull back from fossil fuels not to say that this kind of power generation doesnt come along with substantial risksobviously it does however it seems like virtually all green and socialist parties who over the years have constituted endless committees to investigate the issue and their voters prefer to avoid nuclear power because of its risks they prefer to focus on renewable energies that dont pose an existential risk thats pretty much all that is going on here if fission is a real alternative and its safe then sooner or later it will be part of the socialist agenda but if activist committees investigate fission and continue to conclude that its not safe then it will be tough for democratically organized parties to support it
socialism,not_removed,link
socialism,not_removed,personal opinions and political positions should not be viewed as one
socialism,not_removed,didnt marx talk about transitional demands
socialism,not_removed,she means well and is at least very liberal if not outright socialist but she is not a very good politician public speaking in particular is not her greatest strength
socialism,not_removed,shes really more of an activist than a politician there are hardly more than a handful of actual socialist politicians in the united states im really quite appalled that youd belittle a person running for a political position for being a politician and a socialist politician in a capitalist state at that she has run for office several times mostly based in california ive seen her california gubernatorial debates on cspan id recommend watching them she was taken off the ballot in florida so i wont be voting for her editfor some reason i thought you were talking about gloria la riva for jill stein basically the same except shes from massachusetts she has some strange medical views but otherwise she is fine if she hadnt picked a complete nobody for vp i probably would be voting for her in she strikes me as a professor more than a politician she should be a history professor at an ivy league or liberal arts college not president
socialism,not_removed,might decry young turks as liberal
socialism,not_removed,why support eugene v debs its not like he has any idea whatsoever what to do with it other than ya know run again in four years the answer is that american political consciousness centers around election campaigns and ignoring those campaigns completely is idiotic
socialism,not_removed,lol did you seriously post a sam seder video on rsocialism the last time i remember listening to sam was this closely related discussion with matt stoller years ago where stoller utterly destroyed seder and his pathetic lesserevilism pretty much all of stollers arguments remain more viable today
socialism,not_removed,i dont know the extent of ajamus accusations of false flag but no its not reasonable to think everything is a false flag false flags happen but sometimes people do boneheaded things all on their own is standing rock a false flag was the malheur standoff false flag part of the power in cointelpro is spreading uncertainty and distrust making opponents of the status quo jump at their own shadow and auditing for loyalty instead of spending that moneytimeeffort organizing and agitating
socialism,not_removed,in a word jooz
socialism,not_removed,is she going to gain steam though theres only ten days til the election and she hasnt had spectacular momentum thus far
socialism,not_removed,jill stein is already in the third party fizzleout period unless youre speaking of
socialism,not_removed,i agree i think science has changed a lot and the way research is done funding is given away opinions are accepteddismissed one cant deny negative capitalist influence on minds that ideally ought to be independent freethinkers so yesterday we saw field insiders who exploded when somebody dared to critisize their comfort zone of single chanelled mainstream thinking which for several reasons aligns with corporate interests that aside science still is a objectivity driven community of intellectuals who nethertheless often posses the creativity and mindset to consider outlandish ideas and confront them with facts and jill stein didnt do well when confronted with that i am not saying it is reasonable to vote for trump clinton or johnson simply because jill stein fears wifi and nuclear power plants she is still far better than any of these alternatives and a push for parties is needed i just came to realize that jill herself provides no reason for me as a science major to favor her aside from foreign policies and progressive financial politics but the context of her alternatives
socialism,not_removed,as far as that goes it has been addressed yesterday that the quantity of uranium and start up costs have been demystified nuclear is without subsidies cheaper than renewable and modern methods of cleaning the uranium allow reuse of of the material if i remember correctly as far as the waste goes us territory apparently offers much safer geological storage options than europe and the damages of mining have only been mentioned by jill stein but i am totally uneducated on this take and she doesnt even give a link dont get me wrong i think nuclear should be a transition technology tops but including the wifi the way her vp was depicted and the vaccines popping up again this ama was a desaster and replies likes yours which only give vague lists of topics were confronted yesterday with elaborated fucking essays by professionals no offense comrad i simply feel unrepresented by someone who is so clearly running against scientific common sense and seems to be unable to make clear statements that convince people to vote for her i agree on all her social issues so her analysis is what appeals and makes her the only reasonable candidate but some of her treshild funding and opinionsnuclear is unsafe are objectively irrational
socialism,not_removed,i agree plenty of solarwindwater etc options out there we do not need more nuclear powerplants mile island chernobyl fukashima yeah you can say technology has made them safer but in the end its going to be up to humans to monitor them and humans fail we usa cant even get our failing infrastructure fixed bridges all over the country ready to fall etc and we think its ok to build new nuclear power plants no go with alternative energy we have elon musk making solar roof tiles etc hell im scared to eat fish from the pacific now only reason to go with nuclear is someone making money off selling uranium
socialism,not_removed,i personally would support the kind of nuclear power that france uses as a transitional pull back from fossil fuels so leaky waste barrels put under protected land via the use of discarded mines directly putting at risk natural water reservoirs the running of extremely old power plants with regular emergency situations the refusal to address the rise of cancers in nuclear industry lowerend workers and the extraction of uranium via fucked up canadian mncs and neocolonial relations with subsaharan states france can be fossil fuel free by with a use of renewable energies excluding nuclear energy but the state still puts all its eggs in the nuclear basket because they make a lot of money exporting plants no thanks
socialism,not_removed,he was on the guys radio show twice before appearing in a book he edited thats close enough for me in one of these interviews at the end of some rambling zog conspiracy bullshit baraka says oh exactly or something similar not an emphatic declaration of agreement but again thats enough for me and im really not sure what to think about your claim inre ukraine nazis and zionism which is literally straight out of antisemitic conspiracy websites which are the sources of this claim as far as i can tell
socialism,not_removed,kevin barrett what do you think of this plane malaysian plane shootdown the us media is putting out the possibliities of this being done by the russians or by the prorussian ukrainians but president putins plane was flying through there shortly before this plane was shot down it looks like putins plane may have been targeted if so obviously that wouldnt have been done by the russians or prorussian separatists quote unquote that would have been done by the kiev zionazi government which is what it is these zionist jewish oligarchs billionaire criminal dons are funding nazi street thugs these are the people who overthrew the legitimate democratically elected government of ukraine and created a fascist junta and they are the ones who would be the suspects at least in my opinion somebody shooting at putins plane and yet the media doesnt even raise that as a possibility ajamu baraka and when its raised its raised as a conspiracy i think that this is a i was trying to find the citation i remember reading i cant remember who it was someone wrote about three weeks ago that we should expect false flag a major false flag operation thats going to be blamed on the russians and thats exactly what has happened
socialism,not_removed,shes highly against nuclear energy and has taken a very antiscience position that will effect her policy and thats concerning
socialism,not_removed,i stand corrected but the liberals are still there although a minority are against the socialist stance for now and i was aware about the ygus being all for it theyre part of the reason why the gpus brought up that proposal as the ygus already had the anticapitalist stances
socialism,not_removed,least very liberal um do you mean very social democratic because very liberal means something very different
socialism,not_removed,are they still denying the armenian genocide
socialism,not_removed,jill stein is no eugene v debs
socialism,not_removed,yep ive heard some cringey shit from leftists about worldwide banking conspiracies i hate the bourgeoisie as much as the next guy but the language and tactics used border on antisemitism
socialism,not_removed,hardy har har but seriously are you saying his point is the enormous influence of the israel lobby on us foreign policy
socialism,not_removed,well i think she was at last cycle compared with roughly this cycle so thats actually quite a pronounced difference if she crosses this year next cycle will be a very different race
socialism,not_removed,yeah exactly obviously she cant win this cycle and almost certainly cant next either but you have to start somewhere
socialism,not_removed,the interviewer kevin barrett comes off as a bit of a tool and the other guys interviewed in the segment came off as rightwingers but like other gotcha media links of this type after having listened to the segment i have even more respect for ajamu than i did beforehand i would encourage everyone to listen to this interviewvery educational
socialism,not_removed,antiscience position link also wanting more research on certain things you disagree with is not antiscience that is proscience you may disagree with it but its not antiscience
socialism,not_removed,um if you prefer sure
socialism,not_removed,no cenk recanted that years ago
socialism,not_removed,i meant that your criticisms of her liberalism apply to salt also
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,no i am not i am saying that he believes in antisemitic conspiracy theories
socialism,not_removed,her and gary johnsons success this election is probably thanks to voters who are displeased by bother major candidates both of whom are very unpopular the election will probably have two lesshated major candidates clinton who is very likely to win probably will become less hated during her time in office assuming she doesnt do anything that the public absolutely hates her for though im not sure what to expect out of the next republican nominee to be fair though this election has probably given thirdparties a decent amount of exposure that will give them better chances in elections in the nearfuture
socialism,not_removed,id rather we focus our attention on promoting an actual socialist rather than a milquetoast social democrat whose anticapitalism is green rather than red
socialism,not_removed,they could start by trying to get a single us senate seat before worrying so much about an impossible presidency bid
socialism,not_removed,also i feel the antiscience label depicts a manichean relation between science as necessarily good and critique of science as necessarily bad scienticism is a real thing additionally the researchers subjectivity always influences both research and production of new technology when that subjectivity is heavily shaped by the social structures in todays case capitalism and all the other social hierarchies of oppression research focus and research production will tend towards capitalist needs capitalist goals and capitalist structures and we gotta critique that
socialism,not_removed,taken straight from her ama and i believe ive heard lots of antivaccine things from her although i could be wholly wrong i dont really see her as being skeptical or calling for more research in these fields in fact she simply seems to have a history of making very very strong claims that directly contradict very wellestablished science seriously wifi radiation what the fuck seriously though im not trying to come off as hostile if you can point me towards these very strong beliefs being even slightly reasonable i will gladly change my opinion she seems to be spitting in the face of very very well established research with no real basis however
socialism,not_removed,not really he now basically says im not a historian so i dont know what happened which may sound modest but mostly is just an excuse to refuse to acknowledge the genocide
socialism,not_removed,such as
socialism,not_removed,clinton probably will become less hated during her time in office ha totally disagree with you on this as people find out what they really voted for i think theres going to be more disillusionment and resentment than from the utter lack of delivery on obamas most transparent administrationhope change etc promises
socialism,not_removed,i agree with you but i think that major parties and their financiers are unlikely to go through with major reforms i think theyre in a deathspiral thats unlikely to reform itself consider theyve been on this trajectory for years it is possible though given sanders relative success in a short amount of time clinton may just become more hated since her controversial policies will now be somewhat properly scrutinized and republicans will doubledown on their animosity
socialism,not_removed,i suppose their rationale might be that getting on the debate stage would be a more effective way toward that goal or maybe theres something to the charge that they should focus downticket id be curious to know their reasoning
socialism,not_removed,to be fair to the us green party they do run a lot of local candidates
socialism,not_removed,first off great username secondly i completely agree i think the main takeaway should be that science is a methodology it can be applied by anyone doing anything for example some yogis have a very experiment record repeat sort of way of doing things that methodology lends itself heavily to scienticism and scientific materialism the ideologies should be removed from the methodology and critiqued in that way i have no problem with science i have a problem with dogmatic behaviors edit not that science itself as a methodology is immune to critique but they should be separated
socialism,not_removed,the antivaccine things are honestly opposition propaganda against her shes never been an antivaccer shes a medical doctor for crying out loud the wifi radiation thing has also been blown out or proportion and it seems it may have actually been started by correct the record
socialism,not_removed,her issue with vaccines is the cozy relationship between manufacturers and the fda she wants a more robust independent researchqa and approval process nothing wrong with that imho edit a word
socialism,not_removed,she has rescinded in part her antivaccination statements
socialism,not_removed,it really is you see it all over this site when and wherever she is mentioned and its always people parroting the exact same thing that she has really ccccrrraaazzzyyyy∆ views on vaccinations and thinks wifi is dangerous and they always link her ama
socialism,not_removed,there was nothing to rescind those statements never existed in the first place
socialism,not_removed,it honestly amazes me how people just parrot this bullshit so easily without actually reading what she thinks
socialism,not_removed,people who lived in yugoslavia especially working class people were very fond of the social and economic system that prevailed during titos life and are generally still today supportive of socialism very critical of the us and do not support the splitting up of the country in reality the marketsocialist economy of yugoslavia relied on large loans from the imf which is a situation no country ever wants to find itself in typically when the imf wants to collect on those debts the indebted country is forced to chose between accepting neoliberal economic reforms or be bombed in yugoslavia it was both
socialism,not_removed,better than being bombed back to capitalism by nato after being reasonable with them
socialism,not_removed,uhippicac is an older serb who identifies as a yugoslavian and had good things to say about the country
socialism,not_removed,social democracy at the barrel of a gun but at least the guy holding the gun is pretty cool and knows how to funnel money out of the ussr and usa
socialism,not_removed,bombed back to capitalism and being terrorized by literal nazis and islamic militants armed to the teeth by the us
socialism,not_removed,i prefer to id as yugoslavian socialist heritage not useles national ethnic
socialism,not_removed,its impossible to tell if this is a leftcom viewpoint or a hoxhaist one
socialism,not_removed,oh yes add that up to the list i mean
socialism,not_removed,im a left gommie
socialism,not_removed,thats an utter waste of time comrade nothing will be accomplished besides more social media drama
socialism,not_removed,thank god revisionism doesnt exist where i come from probably thanks to the wonderful socialist system we have here in sweden s
socialism,not_removed,oh for the love of lenin have some fun post some revisionist horseshit
socialism,not_removed,not as such no some socialists advocate for httpsenwikipediaorgwikilabourvoucher which are representations of performed labour and as such reflect the maxim to each according to his contribution they are distinguished from money in that they are not able to circulate as with in a market they are destroyed once exchanged they are not transmutable into capital they can not buy means of production they are not able to build up interest the case for them from some socialists is that under socialism which most of the socialists who support labour vouchers distinguish as a separate mode of production from communism is that they retain remuneration for work done and can sort out temporary shortages and scarcity not all socialists probably most do not agree with labour vouchers you can see some criticisms here httpsenwikipediaorgwikilabourvouchercriticisms
socialism,not_removed,from žižeks jokes did you hear the one about hegel and negation in the a debate is raging in the politburo of the bolshevik will there be money in communism or not the leftist trotskyites claim that there will be no money since money is only needed in the societies with private ownership while the rightist partisans of bukharin claim that of course there will be money in communism since every complex society needs money to regulate the exchange of products when finally comrade stalin intervenes he rejects both the leftist and rightist deviations claiming that the truth is a higher dialectical synthesis of the opposites when other politburo members ask him how this synthesis will look stalin calmly answers there will be money and there will not be money some will have money and others will not have it
socialism,not_removed,many propose using some form of currency likely labor vouchers which uarcaness did a god job of explaining in their comment during the transitional period but most of us agree that the eventual goal is to get rid of currency altogether
socialism,not_removed,there can be money with socialism just not communism
socialism,not_removed,how else would you exchange the fruits of your labour for that of others money is just a token anyway
socialism,not_removed,of course yes it is a need for calculate values of things in exchanging
socialism,not_removed,a good way to put it is communists prefer gift economies for abundant goods and labor voucher economies for scarceluxury goods
socialism,not_removed,thanks comrade this was very informative
socialism,not_removed,someone on here argued that labour vouchers are no good as they create a power structure open to abuseoppression basically along the lines of the fact there would need to be some central authority for issuing labour vouchers and enforcing the correct use of them
socialism,not_removed,getting downvoted for this people using socialism interchangeably with communism i swear its like as they understand libertarian socialism communism they just make out socialism to be a classless and moneyless society
socialism,not_removed,could you explain how this would work in a world without the law of value
socialism,not_removed,i highly suggest reading httpricardoecnwfueducottrellsocialismbook for a good view of how a socialist economy would work but in short abundant goods would be free ie gift economies and production for those goods would simply be filled based on how many people are scanning it through as they leave the store pretty much just as its done now for scarceluxury goods we would use labor vouchers economies where that thing would be valued based on the embedded labor in it and all the embedded labor within its sub parts so a car cost hours labor voucher economies would moderate demand for scarce goods
socialism,not_removed,i dont really support labour vouchers but i dont know if a central authority is made necessary to issue them i can think of plenty of nonhierarchical and democratic ways to distribute them
socialism,not_removed,people using socialism interchangeably with communism i swear you mean like marx and engels did
socialism,not_removed,i dont think value would ever go away part of socialism is valuing people their labors their fruits et cetera you need a metric for that also some materials are rarer than others and sometimes materials become rarer through events were talking about a socialist society not communist
socialism,not_removed,no marx and engels didnt use them interchangeably they described communism as a classless society which would come about after socialism which is a society in which the workers are the ruling class after overthrowing the bourgeoisie and stablishing their own state to ensure a transition towards communism
socialism,not_removed,yes they did use them interchangeably the transition between capitalism and communism is called the dictatorship of the proletariat the resulting society is socialismcommunism
socialism,not_removed,between capitalism and communism is called the dictatorship of the proletariat the dictatorship of the proletariat is a stage in which the workers stablish a state to repress the bourgeoisie and reactionary classes and maintain power after the revolution this is done in to be able to hold political power to expropiate private property and stablish a planned economy marxists dont use two different terms for one single definition for no reason we use socialism to define this historical period of hegemony of the working class collectivization and transition towards communism communism is the latest stage of human society in which there are no classes nor class contradictions there are still class contradictions in socialism the bourgeoisie and its supporters can still exist though weakened but with transnational ties and allies and socialist countries can exist at the same time as capitalist countries plus in socialist societies specially in lowerstages of socialism money can still exist just an example communism would be achieved as the class contradictions in society disappear httpwwwmarxmailorgfaqsocialismandcommunismhtm
socialism,not_removed,the existence of money presupposes private property wage labor surplus value c if your country has any of these things its capitalist full stop the idea that class contradictions can still exist under socialism that there can be socialism in one country or that there can be money and everything that entails in a socialist society are excuses created so the ussr could call itself socialist when it really wasnt httpwwwmarxisthumanistinitiativeorgalternativestocapitalvideotheincoherenceoftransitionalsocietyhtml
socialism,not_removed,capitalism isnt a collection of symptoms feudalism and the asiatic mode of production had all of those listed symptoms yet they were not capitalism money presupposes nothing capitalism can easily exist without it marx called himself a communist and not a socialist for very specific reasons as well to blanket state that they used the terms interchangeably isnt very accurate the incoherence of a transitional society is abjectly ahistorical and completely lacks a knowledge of the growth of human economic production transitions are incoherent yet here we are with a wealth of human knowledge on how we have transitioned from previous modes of production into this one it is an observable and measurable phenomenon and theres no reason to expect it to not be going forward socialism is a movement and a negation of capitalism it is not simply an end goal
socialism,not_removed,capitalism might not be a collection of symptoms but if you have those symptoms you are still capitalist law of value private property commodityform at this historical stage if these things still exist youre in a capitalist society money implies these things because money is a measurement of value which would not exist postcapitalism money implies that the law of value is still in effect which must be abolished in the supersession of capitalism the article doesnt say that transitions are incoherent the argument is that transitional societies are incoherent that a partially capitalist partially communist society is impossible since capitalism is a totalizing system the only possible transition is a destruction of capitalism a revolution and a dictatorship of the proletariat because of this denoting a socialist society as a sort of capitalist but soon to be communist society is ridiculous because youre either capitalist or youre communist not a little bit of both if your society operates according to the law of value youre still capitalist and calling yourself anything else is disingenuous
socialism,not_removed,at this historical stage in this current historical stage yes because capitalism is the primary mode of production yet feudalism existed wholly for decades under capitalism money implies these things because money is a measurement of value which would not exist postcapitalism money implies that the law of value is still in effect which must be abolished in the supersession of capitalism money implies that the rule of exchange value still exists but exchange value does not cease to exist if money ceases to exist also i assume that you specifically mean exchange value here and not use value as use value will never cease to exist the argument is that transitional societies are incoherent that a partially capitalist partially communist society is impossible since capitalism is a totalizing system and yet in the reality of our history symptoms of different modes of production have existed in others commodity production money wage labor and exchange value existed under feudalism and existed under the asiatic mode of production capitalism was the negation of feudalism and then political movement for privatization bourgeoisie rights mercantile rights etc existed and grew under feudalism to the point where it was the dominate economic system and feudalism was no longer able to satisfy the economic process why would socialism as the negation of capitalism not follow the same historical and material precedent set before it this is not an endorsement to the stereotype of socialism in one country as the world revolution is a necessity for socialism but it is an endorsement of the concept that the political movement for socialism and the economic character of socialism can exist within global capitalism just the same as the movement for capitalism and the economic character of capitalism existed within feudalism since capitalism is a totalizing system feudalism was total socialism will be total
socialism,not_removed,money implies that the rule of exchange value still exists but exchange value does not cease to exist if money ceases to exist yes thats what i said if there is money then there is exchange value the law of value is operative and youre under capitalism i wasnt arguing that exchange value necessarily entails money if a then b if b then a but it is an endorsement of the concept that the political movement for socialism and the economic character of socialism can exist within global capitalism just the same as the movement for capitalism and the economic character of capitalism existed within feudalism right but any society with these things exchange value c cannot be called socialist there can be a movement for the abolition of these things and that movement can be called socialist but in a socialist society money would not exist because the law of value private property commodities c would be abolished and with these things abolished money would be just so much paper or lumps of metal or bits of data in a computer server
socialism,not_removed,yes thats what i said if there is money then there is exchange value the law of value is operative and youre under capitalism i wasnt arguing that exchange value necessarily entails money but this also isnt exactly true for example the ussr still saw the use of currency but operated outside of both exchange value and surplus value and there was never a surplus of anything in the ussr as evidenced by its chronice shortage economy the ussr economy was never geared toward or dependent on the law of exchange value and instead currency was a method of regulating what was still an economy dealing with scarcity no amount of potential exchange or surplus value ever superseded the necessity of use value and the distribution of production based on necessity relevant marx secondly after the abolition of the capitalist mode of production but still retaining social production the determination of value continues to prevail in the sense that the regulation of labourtime and the distribution of social labour among the various production groups ultimately the bookkeeping encompassing all this become more essential than ever right but any society with these things exchange value c cannot be called socialist there can be a movement for the abolition of these things and that movement can be called socialist but in a socialist society money would not exist because the law of value private property commodities c would be abolished and with these things abolished money would be just so much paper or lumps of metal or bits of data in a computer server so at what point in time does a feudalistic society with capitalist elements become a capitalist society with feudalistic elements what is the demarcation there and who gets to decide it its easy to look at history and feudalist states and see the rise of capitalism in the form of mercantilism and see capitalism become the dominate political and economic form even though the feudal class relationships were still politically significant powerful and lordlandvassalserf still dichotomy existed the symptoms of capitalism existed yet the states were not capitalist and later on the symptoms of feudalism remained in place but the states were not feudalist these states did not become capitalist when all traces of feudalism ceased to exist and it is through this historical example we apply to socialism my position is that socialism is not an end game that socialism is not the mythical end of history because there will always be the possibility of social antagonisms in which socialism is the movement that will abate and abolish them to assume that socialism is only socialism once capitalism is completely abolished is ahistorical and not materialist socialism stands to ebb and flow throughout an epoch the same way other modes of production have done as long as the socialist movement continues along a progressive arch and solving the problems of antagonisms socialist politics and superstructure are in command and as long as the capitalist class has been expropriated and no longer holds power then a state is socialist until it ceases to be a state more relevant marx the capitalist as capitalist is simply the personification of capital that creation of labour endowed with its own will and personality which stands in opposition to labour but if one eliminates the capitalist the means of production cease to be capital relying on symptoms to claim a mode of production is a red herring a fetish those symptoms of capitalism readily existed in societies that were not capitalist nor were those symptoms the instigator of capitalism in those societies it was the rise of a political class and a monopolization of power
socialism,not_removed,the ussr still saw the use of currency but operated outside of both exchange value and surplus value and there was never a surplus of anything in the ussr as evidenced by its chronice shortage economy of course there was surplus value in the soviet union surplus doesnt refer to a surplus of goods produced but to the value produced by a worker over and above what they are paid in wages which is taken from them and becomes capital in the ussr capital was accumulated by the state instead of an individual capitalist capital is whatever value is alienated from its producer it doesnt matter if the capitalist is an individual or a corporation or a state they still had wage labor in the ussr they still paid the workers for the exchange value of their laborpower and their wages were then used to purchase commodities this is not socialism socialism insofar as it is a moneyless classless stateless society cannot coexist with these things social antagonisms if by that you mean class contradictions and not simply personal differences do not exist under communism because classes have been abolished which was not the case in the ussr a new capitalist had replaced all the individual ones and it was the state i dont think the transition from capitalism to communism can be compared to the transition from feudalism to capitalism because whereas feudalism shares certain features with capitalism as you pointed out communism does not share fundamental features with capitalism because communism isnt just the coming to power of a new class but the abolition of classes because its not just new forms of exploitation but the elimination of exploitation the transition the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be anything but the active destruction of private property the law of value wage labor c it cannot be gradual and it cannot involve those features of capitalism or else capitalism will not disappear but reassert itself as it did in the ussr
socialism,not_removed,capital was accumulated by the state instead of an individual capitalist the state can not accumulate the state is not a capitalist the state has no form or function or being and is merely the organization of a class but even more so the soviet economy rarely accumulated accumulation and a shortage economy are mutually exclusive and per marx the elimination of the capitalist eliminates the means of production as capital a new capitalist had replaced all the individual ones and it was the state name one person in the ussr that owned the means of production and privatized its surplus the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be anything but the active destruction of private property the law of value wage labor c it cannot be gradual either it is the active destruction or it is gradual it cannot happen immediately and if it did then there would be no need for the dotp to put it into action social antagonisms if by that you mean class contradictions and not simply personal differences do not exist under communism some form of antagonism will exist why else would marx suppose the need for free association or else capitalism will not disappear but reassert itself as it did in the ussr we agree capitalism was restored in the ussr but only after years of attempting to abolish it this is not socialism socialism insofar as it is a moneyless classless stateless society cannot coexist with these things and regarding regarding your final paragraph as well the end all be all full communism socialism yes but the socialism as it comes to power must coexist because it is governed by a material world socialism and its economics are a material thing to presume that it will operate outside of our material existence and historical knowledge is contrary to both material and empirical observation and is subject to our material existence and historical outlook it is the politics of the proletariat not some nebulous utopian concept as the end of history
socialism,not_removed,i mean i would be ok with that so much free time to make music and go hiking
socialism,not_removed,being completely separate from the global economy would not be the goal the goal is to partake in the world in a happier and more sustainable way to be completely anti to anything except for physical and emotional violence would be a mistake yea we would have a scientist in every field and yes this would be a large community think medium sized town we would have people from every field working for our town in exchange for a quality life yes we could sell all types of goods from the farm using aquaponic systems we could yield high quantities of produce and also have all types of trees and fabric produce most farmers subsidized by governments only grow one crop or a few crops this farm would need to build to have everything we would need honestly im not quite sure how it could all work because im not an expert in agriculture but im sure there could be a way also hunk of this town as a company itself where everyone is an equal shareholder so employees get everything for free but outsiders would pay for goods produced here we would be continually searching for ways we could make our own technologies and what not now i dont know exactly how we could connect to the internet but if big companies can provide the service there must be a way we could provide our own
socialism,not_removed,this seems like an incredibly ungrounded utopian though admittedly nice dream its not at all clear to me why you think a small society youd mentioned the size of just a small city would be able to achieve all of that with each member working only ten hours a week lets start small do you think you could live sustainably off of the land by yourself if you worked only hours a week even if you started with a house and existing farmland and were educated in good health and had reasonable farming equipment given to you for free to start that seems like a very tall order farming is notoriously labor intensive even with the tools we currently have if you concede that running your experiment with a community size of is impossible then at what size of a community do we start to see the additional human labor suddenly increasing efficiency to the point that the group could not only provide the lifestyle you enjoy today but also do it with significantly less time spend doing work how did you arrive at that number taken another way if you hold the quality of life constant between todays reality and your scenario and assume that an adult works hours per week on average youre underlying assumption is that we spend of our time on work that is fundamentally unnecessary for society to thrive thats a bold statement unless youre willing to write off whole industries and unnecessary i dont see how you could possibly justify that assumption
socialism,not_removed,i think you might require two different spheres the ruralnatural vs the dense urban cities with lots of parks and no motorized transportation except for the disabled if one also had a high carbonecotax and grew foods required for cities with intensive aerohydroaquaponics tended to by machines or humans then it might work the responsibility of the people in the rural communities would also be to produce their own food and also maintain facilities for people to enjoy the great outdoors and house amphitheaters and other cultural spaces i think one of the largest hurdles to ecosocialism is the automobile and personal mobility it reinforces the nuclear family and is just too expensive for individualfamily ownership it perpetuates the consumerist culture by physically enabling it and allowing people to move out to the burbs in the us and commute in to avoid taxes it is also a large employer with highpaying desirable jobs i think sharing the proceeds produced by robots and giving all quality education child rearing science philosophy culture sports medicine and agriculture would provide plenty of jobs and hours of work i think is fine
socialism,not_removed,i lived in something of the sort but we all worked hours a week but washing clothes cleaning the house and childcare or your own children counted as work
socialism,not_removed,such is the life for rural communists life is communing with the earth therefore the toys and creations of man lose a lot of their pleasureful qualities certainly the urban metropolis would continue to maintain their technological superiority but such is their nature above all we must maintain a symbiotic relationship with the earth regardless
socialism,not_removed,why couldnt we have internet and phones and computers one time purchases would need to be calculated into the startup of the community im talking about a high tech sustainable community we could have our own internet connection without a monthly cost we would have our own scientists and only make one time purchases for things that can reproduce like antibodies for vaccines and machines that make many of one product since wed have an abundance of food from our farm we could sell the overflow and make a profit for the community which we could use to make more one time purchases
socialism,not_removed,my favorite things too
socialism,not_removed,you work out what you want and need as a society educate people and divide labour to meet those needs this means you spread only necessary work as socially determined among all who are able to work cutting work hours per person drastically rather than having a high rate of unemployment constant crises of overproduction and the product of your labour taken away from you so youll be compelled to keep selling your labour all technology that increases the productivity of labour means shorter work hours as opposed to layoffs please direct beginner questions to
socialism,not_removed,why would we need to give up technology why not have internet to stay connected so we could have power over our image in the media and stay connected to family and friends and complete strangers why not have clean electricity from sun corn and or water that could power smart cars and lights and the rest of our technology not a disconnected rural community a sustainable technological haven
socialism,not_removed,so continue the exploitation of the third world do you realize how much stuff goes into building computers and phones from mines in africa to sweatshops in asia its not something that can be made in a small community you cant use future noncurrently available technology as an argument
socialism,not_removed,my response wasnt a question it was a critique of the op dont be a an asshole note that nowhere in my response was i defending the problems with capitalism in any way just pointing out that saying we can have a society with the exact same amenities as today with of the total labor input seems a bit bold of a claim without any data behind it this means you spread only necessary work as socially determined among all who are able to work cutting work hours per person drastically rather than having a high rate of unemployment constant crises of overproduction and the product of your labour taken away from you so youll be compelled to keep selling your labour that may make sense if youre willing to define necessary work as some subset of the work that is done today maybe you decide hey banking as an industry shouldnt exist and thus you free up a tremendous number of workers to focus on other tasks thats all fine thats not a constraint the op specified though
socialism,not_removed,so are you not on a phone or computer right now if we want to change how this stuff is made we have to change it im sure there could be a way to make this stuff locally if we tried im not an expert but there has to be a way to figure it out and this way of living would eventually reach out to those parts of the world realistically robots should and will take over all high risk dirty jobs humans have to do we should have a way of life that is a net working ten hours a week overseeing those robots in exchange for needs being met with high quality is a great deal
socialism,not_removed,it was a critique of the op consider it a response to your critique ill be clearer youre either a beginner or a troll
socialism,not_removed,perhaps its best to end the year with some inspiration to look forward to promote our movement as one of compassion and solutions as well as an objection of not only the establishments statusquo but also the rise of hatred and violence that merely work to protect the system of oppression youre are not machines you are not cattle you are men solidarity for and heres to a movement that will provide a new world for the people by the people
socialism,not_removed,this speech while inspiring is also a criticism you see how he moves over the space of three different framings his descent from humble and hopeful to a full on populist figure he recognizes following his own heil like gesture that the crowd is cheering for war based on his anger and call for violence against another other rather than simply following his argument which is more and more angry relying on christianity and calls for war this is a criticism of american fascism which is super but it also drives our emotions in the last through populist and fascist rhetoric everyone else oppresses you but i wont they treat you like cattle so lets form an army gain at them etc
socialism,not_removed,now ive never seen this movie but this speech the only words that come to my mind are damn
socialism,not_removed,im not sure how its a criticism of american fascism though he sounded more like a leftist populist by the end in calling for soldiers to stop being controlled by those in power by calling for internationalism and by calling for unity against bigotry and oppression
socialism,not_removed,beyond adornos criticism that the group which engineered the seizure of power in germany was also certainly a gang but the problem is that such elective affinities are not extraterritorial they are rooted within society itself that is why the buffoonery of fascism evoked by chaplin as well is at the same time also its ultimate horror if this is suppressed and a few sorry exploiters of greengrocers are mocked where key positions of economic power are actually at issue the attack misfires the great dictator loses all satirical force and becomes obscene when a jewish girl can hit a line of stormtroopers on the head with a pan without being torn to pieces for the sake of political commitment political reality is trivialized it is an amazing movie and as with all chaplin films a gut busting comedy
socialism,not_removed,its more at the level of form for me if you notice how the sequence is structured how he is framed in reference to the microphones and medium shots or closeup a where his eyes go how his body reacts the tone of his voice who he addresses mewe soldiers mankind he drifts towards unity through violence from a more utopian beginning in the end hes simply utilizing anger to rile up the crowd i think it is a criticism of american fascism by means of being made in the us in the chaplin biopic he is inspired to make this movie after attending a dinner party where a nazi in attendance is treated as a remarkable and witty guest for whom everyone has questions and who has charming answers for nazi ideas you can see chaplins sympathy for leftist causes in the first of the speech but the microphones and the crowd corrupt him into becoming the ruler he begins by claiming he doesnt want to be he overturns nearly all of the leftist sentiments he starts with becoming the vey leader who promises freedom for everyone while elevating himself it is no doubt a liberal criticism rfullcommunism would take chaplin at his word and declare war on oppression through violent means but like most of chaplins work it comes down to the last gesture even if we agree with most of his ideas at the level of content this is pure rhetoric and the massive audience in attendance and listening on the radio pervert chaplin into the heil and the recognition of sameness between himself and hinkle hitler and you can see the life drain out of his face as he comes to that realization hitler too with an enemy to blame promised freedom and prosperity against former modes of oppression that satisfied the hurt of their economic depression and national humiliation following
socialism,not_removed,were fucked beyond hope
socialism,not_removed,wow thats a shitload of bordiga just what i want
socialism,not_removed,im a writing and english major at florida state university in the us and a good old fashioned dirty commie would love some more info on how to write for you guys
socialism,not_removed,do we just apply on the contribute part of the website if so then ive applied
socialism,not_removed,if youd like to be involved that would be great drop me an email at editorattheredtopcouk
socialism,not_removed,any pay
socialism,not_removed,sounds great 👍 drop me an email at editorattheredtopcouk and well chat some more about it 😎
socialism,not_removed,thank you
socialism,not_removed,hmm i find it terribly ironic that a proclaimed leftist magazine is offering voluntary unpaid interships
socialism,not_removed,and asking democrats to write for them
socialism,not_removed,thats not ironic so long as no one is earning but i dont know if they are
socialism,not_removed,also that they invited democrats in colorado i like the wolff stuff that red top puts out but the labour love is ridiculous
socialism,not_removed,havent you heard obama is part of the left so is hillary
socialism,not_removed,its still ironic time and labor writing are two things people cannot afford to give out in exchange for exposure or experience we need to pay rent and food even if nobody is earning in the traditional monetary sense the company is still earning free labor that promotesbenefits their business in one way shape or form and a leftist arguing for that under capitalism is highly ironic
socialism,not_removed,i just reckon that if it runs at a loss for the sake of improving the poor state of affairs that is leftwing media it doesnt seem wrong to me that they dont pay contributors if they themselves arent paid either so long as theres attribution but i suppose thats only really true if they would never be paid — otherwise the contributor would deserve a share of any eventual profit so okay if theyre just an ordinary business and theyre asking for unpaid contribution i can see how that might be ironic
socialism,not_removed,sadly you are correct the red top does indeed run at a loss currently i cover the server and marketing costs while we work toward breaking even and then eventually repaying our contributors for their work 👍
socialism,not_removed,no baathism may not be fascist per se but its alarmingly similar in a couple of ways its founded on nationalism and their socialism is really closer to class collaborationism in which all classes are united and subservient to the statenation theyre always authoritarian something approaching half a million people died he persecuted both shiite muslims and kurdish people for example saddam attacked the shiite marsh arabs by destroying their land once a significant wetland the marshes in southern iraq were devastated by a government drainage plan that left behind a wasteland in marsh arabs lived in the region now percent of the area is in ruins and only an estimated people remain tens of thousands live in refugee camps in iran efforts are now underway to restore the marshes human rights watch calls the campaign against the marsh arabs a crime against humanity and other rights activists call it genocide there are claims chemical weapons also were used httpwwwredflagnewscomheadlinesiamyourpapamoammarkhadafysexslaverevealsnightmareofrapefearandcaptivity is responsible for the brutal rapes of hundreds of women and girls all while masquerading as a feminist bashir alassad is the guards hung me by my wrists from the ceiling for eight days after a few days of hanging being denied sleep it felt like my brain stopped working i was imagining things my feet got swollen on the third day i felt pain that i have never felt in my entire life it was excruciating i screamed that i needed to go to a hospital but the guards just laughed at me these are states which humiliate suppress degrade and torture the people they rule im deeply disgusted with socialists who throw away important principles commitment to liberating working people from capital egalitarianism a world free of oppression and support any one of these states in the name of antiimperialism i dont consider them my comrades
socialism,not_removed,no thread
socialism,not_removed,give this thread a read
socialism,not_removed,examples
socialism,not_removed,who would have guessed that a billionaire would take great interest in the wellbeing of billionaires and not the working class
socialism,not_removed,thats not a surprise
socialism,not_removed,what is the surprise people are fucking dumb and the system is fucked
socialism,not_removed,what a shocker s
socialism,not_removed,is vox moving to the left now
socialism,not_removed,when asked for comment watson confirmed that there was no fecal matter to be found in the immediate area
socialism,not_removed,horray
socialism,not_removed,amazing isnt it
socialism,not_removed,i cant really call anyone stupid well actually i can the working class people have been so far indoctrinated that many of them actually idolize bourgeoisie but i think more and more people are becoming aware of the deeprooted oppression caused by capitalist america just look at how much popularity that bernie sanders obtained despite getting almost no attention by the mainstream media i have a strong belief that had bernie been given the nomination he would have demolished trump thats why the corrupt democrats gave clinton the nomination despite bernie being significantly more popular as long as the top have someone to protect their special interests it doesnt really matter who is in charge
socialism,not_removed,i feel your pain comrad i live in a deep red part of my state and i am currently the only socialist i know of within the next miles cant even talk about my beliefs without being bashed about them and how itll never work
socialism,not_removed,im a christian communist but yes you are correct of course religious persecution was a thing in those countries unfortunately but we can look back on that and say it was bad not that it had anything specifically to do with communism all true communists even atheists are opposed to religious persecution and bigotry this does not mean that certain reactionary churches and organized forms of hate bigotry and the defense of capitalism should not be combatted but that they should not be combatted solely because they are religious institutions
socialism,not_removed,i feel i must point out that liberation theology is a thing what oppression has been wrought by the organized institutions of bourgeois religion is best not reflected on the concept as a whole even as an atheist myself
socialism,not_removed,thats a bit of a simplistic argument in medieval europe at least the institutions of organized religion often advocated for the interests of peasants and other commoners certainly by the dawn of the modern era and the birth of capitalism organized religion was mostly seamlessly integrated into the ruling class so in the most relevant portion of history ie when communismsocialism was on the rise the church was almost always solidly in the camp of communisms ideological opponents
socialism,not_removed,i feel your pain comrad i live in a deep red part of my state and i am currently the only socialist i know of within the next miles cant even talk about my beliefs without being bashed about them and how itll never work automod removed last post for having the word spid in it or its still there i dont know how this automod works
socialism,not_removed,there are lots of reasons why theyre all anti church and most are anti religion
socialism,not_removed,if you think school is bad wait till you enter the workforce
socialism,not_removed,marx said that religion is the opium of the people giving hope to alienated worker
socialism,not_removed,easy solution burn down the churches and the oppressors with them glorious russia did it before it was cool
socialism,not_removed,more likely it is because the church was heavily involved in the already existing hierarchy that was just overthrown lets be honest tsar nicholas ii was the orthodox church
socialism,not_removed,eh little column a little column b
socialism,not_removed,okay this is my first comment on reddit ever and im commenting as an atheist democraticsocialist professor with a phd who teaches century literature and specializes in feminist theory cultural theory marxism and literary satire your professor is not wrong and im not sure your quote from class is an example of the daily ideology found in school im specifically wondering about the context of the lecture and the use of communist regimes and i can only guess based on the statement was your professor explicitly speaking about the possibility of marxist socialism in action or are we talking about communist regimes a regime is usually understood as an authoritarian form of government and a communist regime would have a specific historical context if speaking of say stalinist communism these totalitarian regimes were antireligion because the governing body was meant to act as a kind of standin and yes all faith and loyalty were meant for the regime if you study any of the popular works of fiction depicting this relationship obviously would be one as well as the handmaids tale for a more contemporary take youll find clear examples of how the government would take the rituals and traditions of the peoples religion to instill a heightened sense of nationalism aka loyalty to those in power and purpose what better way to control a population of people than by shifting their everyday beliefs and faithful acts from one institution onto another im afraid many on here are confusing communist regime with socialism but i cant say for sure without the context of your professors statement stalinist russia and other fascist dictatorships of the and regimes that were selfproclaimed communist or socialist were anything but
socialism,not_removed,meanwhile when they talk about socialism never working they have no slightest idea what socialism even is besides when they go and chip in for someone in need in their churches for example it is ok but the same idea happening on a large scale when the whole society works so everyones needs are met then oh my freaking god its awful makes no sense
socialism,not_removed,deep red you say
socialism,not_removed,im a canadian and the only person who reacted negatively when i told people i was a communist was my american exgirlfriend the way she reacted youd think i told a junobeach storming relative of mine that i was a nazi and going to join the ss i empathize
socialism,not_removed,im a christian communist one or the other
socialism,not_removed,thats why i mentioned churches rather than actual beliefs
socialism,not_removed,i feel i must point out that liberation theology is a thing what oppression has been wrought by the organized institutions of bourgeois religion is best not reflected on the concept as a whole religion is a lie and liberation theology is a bad joke our mission is not to lie to the proletariat and obscure the reality of our society and the universe we should not preocupuy ourselves with disproving religion thats already been done but be stalwart in our position that there exists nothing in the universe but matter and motion
socialism,not_removed,dont worry ive been in the construction industry for years i know whats out there
socialism,not_removed,socialism is the guberment wants all yer money
socialism,not_removed,we must reappropriate the peoples color from the vile clutch of the bourgeoisie and their cheerleaders
socialism,not_removed,a different kind of red
socialism,not_removed,conservatives
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,ah i see now thats an interesting valid point you are making i think its important that theres now this clarification because if you read the comments after your post theres a lot of circlejerk going on about how people often use examples of failed communist regimes for the purpose of proving that socialism could never work or even more myopic rants about religion in general none of that offers anything useful to the conversation with the added context i see that you were trying to complicate what you felt was a simplistic explanation from the professor and thats certainly worth the debate with that said i dont think the professor was forcing a certain ideology on the class hes sticking to a popular narrative that tells only part of the story im not proreligion by any stretch of the imagination quite the opposite although i keep my opinions to myself when i teachor at least try but the required readings probably give me away but we cant discount the fact that religion is incredibly important in the lives of the everyday people and history does demonstrate that we have experienced several mass movements on a global scale that were instigated by the suppression of religion by institutions of power forced secularization is just one of the major factors of totalitarianism that is easy to analyze across the board so its perhaps too easy to teach only that angle during a lecture besides regimes of any sort are naturally repressive and use oppressive measures and communism is no different im guessing this is a traditional lecture course that doesnt welcome class discussion i know some professors are traditionalists but most welcome the challenge to the narrative if students present it in a respectful manner during discussion and if your professor is any good hed then mention a few credible sources for you to explore that could also further challenge normalizing narratives that would take an undergraduate course to more of a graduate level theres just so much out there and scholarship is a conversation amongst knowledgeable peers socialism at its finest when done right
socialism,not_removed,thats right to give everyone healthcare education housing and pensions how do they dare freaking bastards no morals whatsoever
socialism,not_removed,its sad that a principled marxist stand is edgy
socialism,not_removed,those selfless sons of bitches
socialism,not_removed,go fuck yourself id love to see you say that to the men and women currently fighting in rojava while youre likely sitting in a nice leather computer chair doing nothing thing is you wouldnt because you know you would be wrong so maybe think before you say such ignorant shit
socialism,not_removed,godless creatures and if this is not enough they will take away your freedom to get in debt too
socialism,not_removed,calm down there dude it seems your angry im not sure what rojava has anything to do with this other than score some cheap points you sound like one of those god save our troops losers lol
socialism,not_removed,the federal guverment impeded my rights to own a slave bastards
socialism,not_removed,i am angry i thought that was obvious i am in support of fellow communists and it pisses me off that their sacrifices are being invalidated by some armchair socialist your fraudulence is noted and rojava has plenty to do with the majority of them are christians and muslims which you would know if you pulled your head out of your ass
socialism,not_removed,i am in support of fellow communists theyre not communists and it pisses me off that their sacrifices are being invalidated by some armchair socialist armchair incomparison to what nonsocialist national liberation projects that make first world socialists feel good about themselves and important the majority of them are christians and muslims which you would know if you pulled your head out of your ass i dont see the relevance
socialism,not_removed,theyre not communists really and you are armchair incomparison to what nonsocialist national liberation projects that make first world socialists feel good about themselves and important i suggest actually reading up on this topic before you actually try to refute that they arent communists your blatant ignorance is actually embarrassing i dont see the relevance wow okay
socialism,not_removed,lol explain how in anyway rojava is communistic
socialism,not_removed,im not here to do your homework for you if i could remember a post of yours that i had seen that didnt scream lul ur a liberal or some other nonconstructive bull shit i would be more inclined to humor you further truth is you post just to be antagonistic and anyone who doesnt agree with your despotic view of what communist is cant have a constructive conversation with you my personal ideology aside i think you are just an annoying person with nothing better to do so feel free to have the last word
socialism,not_removed,im not here to do your homework for you ive done mine rojava is a capitalist state the communal economy is based on private property and wage labor if i could remember a post of yours that i had seen that didnt scream lul ur a liberal or some other nonconstructive bull shit i would be more inclined to humor you further so you have nothing and your only recourse is to fail to answer my question and whine about how mean im being if i could remember a post of yours that i had seen that didnt scream lul ur a liberal or some other nonconstructive bull shit i would be more inclined to humor you further no its just the marxist view im sorry if im an asshole but this forum is filled with hardcore revolutionary communists who dont know shit and its distressing to know that they honest to god believe some of the shit that they do
socialism,not_removed,i will be coming from philly if anyone in philly needs a car pool i can bring one passenger
socialism,not_removed,nice to see comrades in pa im in pittsburgh
socialism,not_removed,yeah that would be awesome id love to go unfortunately my obligations to wage slavery prevent me from doing so
socialism,not_removed,what do yall plan on doing
socialism,not_removed,should go out for the demo if you have the means i think folks are coordinating carpools if you cant drive there
socialism,not_removed,the common marxist viewpoint is that the desire for most luxury goods is not natural but rather were taught to desire them were socialized into becoming consumers under a mode of production that function on a basis of productionforuse rather than productionfor exchange we would not particularly desire diamonds or sports cars not to mention the fact that workers councils would likely utilize it for more pressing needs whether this will hold true or not we should not interpret socialism as merely capitalism but better modes of production have such a drastic effect on society that even lower stage communism socialism will likely cause us to rethink a lot of our anthropological preconceptions
socialism,not_removed,sorry for being ignorant but wouldnt things like labor vouchers just be money like isnt it the same concept
socialism,not_removed,ive been wondering the same thing i would think there would have to be some kind of meritocracy system not the fake one in capitalism where people build credit with labour surplus for luxury items but would like to hear others thoughts
socialism,not_removed,if were talking about things like big yachts they should be owned collectively to be used by vacationers
socialism,not_removed,potentially luxuries could be made by people who get feelgoods from the work and distributed to whomever they like for whatever reason it would have to be totally freely done to avoid de facto slavery personally i wouldnt really care how luxuries happen as long as basic necessities are met for everyone i could even see something very much like wage labor and forprofit market economics for luxuries
socialism,not_removed,i dont see why they cant be pre ordered and manufactured and distributed according to needs and demand as well as resources there are very few actually rare things a lot of things that are luxury items have no need of being so jewelry diamonds arent rare and both diamonds and gold can be synthesised cars a pain in the arse and needless for urban dwellers if we improved public transport a necessity for us rural people either way you can literally make the entire body out of hemp and charge them from clean energy if the tech wasnt being held back and the price being pushed up phones recycle the old ones into parts and give everyone one we have no need of new models which are the same as the old model they only need to be changed every time there is a technological advancement its mostly software pets take a short course on pet care and prove you are worthy of caring for one and be issued with one when it becomes available horses everyone gets a turn if they want it at caring for riding and making friends with our horsies at a proper facility where they are looked after boats everyone gets a turn fancy clothes now freely available nice house they are all nice and issued according to needs nice furniture go on pick up a chair its not much more hassle to make the good stuff than the shite
socialism,not_removed,what do we count as luxury items there are many foolish ways to waste resourceslike gold jewelry and diamond rings i would like to do away with those completely
socialism,not_removed,i think the idea of labour vouchers is reasonable however some people plain cant work disabled people mentally and physically older people etc who still deserve to have luxuryleisure items in their life i would say that every individual could be allotted a certain number of arbitrary units credits each yearmonthday which they could exchange for nonessentials this way everyone receives an equal amount of resources regardless of whether they can or will work
socialism,not_removed,do you mean from an anthropological standpoint i can talk a bit about how gift economies have and still do operate but none of them really resemble industrial socialism
socialism,not_removed,assuming we win class struggle different regions will probably experiment with different methods and some will be good some will be bad
socialism,not_removed,lower stage communism socialism do you include what many call actually existing socialism cuba ussr etc in this category i would also like to add that not all luxury goods are useless prestige items like diamonds there are many goods wholly unnecessary for the functions of life that serve practical purposes even if recreationally only
socialism,not_removed,not all luxury is objectively useless foam mattress versus spring mattress for example one is usually materially better yet has higher production costs and some sort of reasonable rationing is going to be required unless youre handwaving those limitations away with post scarcity
socialism,not_removed,no depending on who you read labor vouchers differ in that a they are nontransferable ie they are yours only you can spend them and you earned them and b they can have a expiry date attached to them the point is to retain the advantages of a currency system for goods distribution while counteracting the negative aspects such as accumulation of wealth
socialism,not_removed,so labour vouchers because thats basically what they are
socialism,not_removed,i am pretty sure hes talking about exclusionary goods a for example a fancy phone and the like
socialism,not_removed,i could even see something very much like wage labor and forprofit market economics for luxuries socapitalism then
socialism,not_removed,i would say luxury items are things that we dont need to survive and dont necessarily advance life ex tvs cell phones jewelry etc
socialism,not_removed,arent you going to run into who gets to shovel manure sort of issues here or am i misinterpreting you and you want to combine both
socialism,not_removed,do you include what many call actually existing socialism cuba ussr etc in this category well said states wasnt a gift economy or labour voucher system to my knowledge as they maintained the moneyform so to not make this into a sectarian bash id just contended theyre not really relevant to the actual question i would also like to add that not all luxury goods are useless prestige items like diamonds there are many goods wholly unnecessary for the functions of life that serve practical purposes even if recreationally only yeah should have been more clear here sorry i will also try to answer you id refer to what i said about workers councils theyd decide by communication with others or some central planning board opinions differ which commodities should be produced which would likely include most of the recreational items we use today id say that there are two conclusions from what this will result in the realist view would be that you have the local laptop local bike local diving gear etc produced for efficiency this would be the reasonable rationing marx himself however often talked about how capitalism actually constrains labour and production its equally likely that beyond these standards wed see a explosion of variety as tinkerers and artisans start to create commodities for the sake of pleasure likely drawing from resources put at side of this experimental purpose in a gift economy this likely means youd have to know the right people and personalized commodities will thus mostly be in the hands of actual enthusiasts whether it be motorcycles computers or dark chocolate
socialism,not_removed,i never claimed they where useless i think you might have misunderstood something for your other questions i tried to answer them in my reply to dennismoore
socialism,not_removed,thank you for clearing that up for me
socialism,not_removed,a good counterbalance for accumulation is the ideas proposed by a demurrage currency in other words the labour vouchers would have to be periodically stamped in order to guarantee their use the idea of this is to circumnavigate simple accumulation and ensure that products flow perpetually the motion of which is the basis of economic activity
socialism,not_removed,couldnt the labor vouchers just be exchanged for valuable resources which could then be slowly accumulated into wealth what if six wannabe entrepreneurs got together and started pooling their resources together
socialism,not_removed,i guess so yeah i was not familiar with that term but came to the same conclusion
socialism,not_removed,no the means of production would still be owned through whatever collectiveconsensus means for the basis of the economy especially housing with your favorite anticapitalist organization and distribution method for production and distribution of food healthcare education etc but on top of that its possible that a stratum of quasicapitalist production and distribution for luxuries would be acceptable
socialism,not_removed,if the resources are there i dont see why a committee cant be formed to start production of non essentials
socialism,not_removed,not really sure what you mean could you elaborate
socialism,not_removed,why not take an idea that is already widely accepted and adapt it in the shape of inflation it then requires periodical hikes in the amount of vouchers gained from productive activity but again thats a widely accepted and understood mechanism that people are already familiar with as individual vouchers gradually lose value people are incentivized into using them and there is a natural decay mechanism as well i see no harm in adapting existing mechanisms where it makes sense to do so the core problem is the power relations stemming from the ownership of the means of production not the presence or lack of a market economy to govern distribution of goods theres a good argument to be made for establishing a baseline that is simply gifted to all citizen food shelter and so on particiulary the means to participate in society be it a smartphone or whatever and then have work incentivized in part by the earning of labor vouchers to acquire luxury goods so its hard to get somebody to shovel manure six hours a day well why not increase the incentive to carry out that job
socialism,not_removed,great opportunity for a black market in fake stamps
socialism,not_removed,well i am possibly muddling about a bit outside of my depth here so forgive me if i get it wrong that rather depends on what you are and are not willing to make subject to labour vouchers a sensible implementation would entail that only the end commodity is subject to such consider a pair of sneakers labour vouchers would in such a scenario not allow you to acquire the rubberplastic for the sole nor the partially assembled shoe only the consumer endproduct in the shape of the sneaker pair in a cardboard box in such a setup then yes it would be possible to pool resources and create a sneakerbased black market but for what purpose a black market is only viable in scenarios where the alternative is unpalatable due to prohibition or inability to meet demand both problems we already see and deal with today think the drug trade as an example of the former and wartime rationing for the latter is it not more sensible to prevent either of these from occurring that doesnt mean that people cant trade goodsforservices by trading sneakers for favors of one type or another but we need to consider if its such a problem in the first place say a pair of sneakers for the neighbours kid mowing the lawn because you cant be bothered is that a problematic transaction id wager hed be annoyed at the number of sneakers before the summer is over though of course a sneakerbased economy is ludicrous people will undoubtedly find some other nonperishable substitute if it comes to that and permitting that sort of transitioning also means you can sidestep the potentially thorny issue of remunerating socially valuable services that are hidden or too small scale to bother with from the point of view of a central administration but then that in turn requires some sort of limited ability to transfer vouchers around on a temporary basis say to facilitate the purchase of that icecream you promised in exchange for mowing the lawn you lazy git as with everything that involves people and economics is people it becomes muddy pretty damn quickly even a relatively simple idea such as nontransferable currency quickly grows in complexity and scope
socialism,not_removed,and exchanged them for what at the end of the day food stamps can only give you food further its hardly like machinery etc would be available in stores even if they did collect a massive amount of misc vouchers
socialism,not_removed,if they are non transferable how do you pay a bunch of capitalists without leaving a paper trail
socialism,not_removed,why would the workers consent to having their surplus value expropriated from them under full communism
socialism,not_removed,a commonly used and not unreasonable line of reasoning is that there are some socially useful tasks that arent terribly pleasant or desirable and that the coercive nature of employment is required to ensure that these tasks are done as far as arguments go its a legitimate concern wrapped up in the purest of terrible ideology but i can and do agree that a incentive structure of some description can address the challenges herein think dirty dishes problem or the like
socialism,not_removed,i agree with you my point is that a restructuring of market frameworks will necessarily entail some changes in currency and exchange capabilities which is why i suggested the counterbalancing opportunities offered by demurrage currencies in particular payment via labour vouchers tends towards different ends it must necessarily account for strength of work time taken to work in the profession time of work and other components such as family size and so on this can be answered by the demurrage currency system which as i said requires constant circulation
socialism,not_removed,these days you can just use systems like credit cards that dont rely on physical stamps though
socialism,not_removed,and exchanged them for what at the end of the day food stamps can only give you food what if theres a famine and a group of wannabe bourgeoise have a hoarded several tons of rice to sell or barter for or demand labor for etc at the opportune moment in that instance it would seem that the surplus of personal means of nourishment has been transformed into an accumulation of capital
socialism,not_removed,when you have the ability to walk away when youre being ripped off your bargaining position gets a lot stronger in contrast to today where people desperately need their job just to survive and take whatever they get even though its a rip off
socialism,not_removed,for every security measure there is a countermeasure
socialism,not_removed,are you aware that under communism the entirety of society is organized as a militia those idiots who hoard food will become food for crows this is selfevident
socialism,not_removed,when you have the ability to walk away when youre being ripped off your bargaining position gets a lot stronger right sowhy would the workers consent to having their surplus value expropriated from them under full communism
socialism,not_removed,same can be said for all the counterfeited currency floating around under capitalism a guy was just giving away a euro note online yesterday i had to get one of those marker pens that check currency to make sure i wasnt being paid in counterfeit notes when i take on a job
socialism,not_removed,fair point
socialism,not_removed,they wouldnt
socialism,not_removed,instead of just using physical stamps we can just digitise it we can construct a system that uses a quantum number generatorchina has one to tailor each code for each individual and the benefits is it cant be copied becasue when it leaves point ayour job to point byour account there is no way to know if that is your code becasue you will the only person who can own the key to decrypt it it maybe wishful thinking but with computers you can do anything
socialism,not_removed,then there would be no profit
socialism,not_removed,note that i said quasicapitalist i dont know the exact form that such organizations would take its possible that people would be fine with having some of their surplus labor value skimmed off if its all kind of bullshit because nobodys life is at stake sort of like how people continue to play a sport even if theyre mediocre at it in contrast to the capitalists caricature of us im not against the existence of people who are successful but against the existence of poverty and ignorance and i think that most people have a similar position the thing im thinking of thats like what im talking about with quasicapitalistic luxury production is in the video game thirdparty markets for ingame items there are a lot of methods for these markets one of them is dkps or dragon kill points which started out as recordkeeping of favors but have evolved into currency another would be the myriad currencies on thirdparty websites which buy and sell virtual objects you can sell your stuff to them for credit with that website then use that credit to buy ingame items these are not things that could easily be classified as full communism but i wouldnt have any objection to their existence because they exist in context of games perhaps luxuries in general could be handled similarly without serious problems for example you work some of the time in a collective pharmacy which is part of the regional federation and so forth and communicates with nearby hospitals and distributes everything freely then you work some of the time as i dont know a lapidary just because i like the word and you get paid an hourly wage but the moneys only useful for buying other luxuries there is of course a danger that this could very quickly devolve right back into capitalism but im only brainstorming here
socialism,not_removed,the issue is that youre implying the reintroduction of private property relations and an employeremployee relationship and for no apparent reason why would certain people have the right to own the means of production and employ wagelabor in a communist society why would a communist society ever agree to the coercive methods needed for upholding private property if people are incentivized to create luxury items because it makes them feel good then why wouldnt they just collectively produce luxuries based on shared resources
socialism,not_removed,why would certain people have the right to own the means of production and employ wagelabor in a communist society because luxuries dont really matter why would a communist society ever agree to the coercive methods needed for upholding private property im not saying that would be necessary or that it would take that form but again its hardly coercion when only luxuries are involved you are not coerced by not having a yacht or jewelry if people are incentivized to create luxury items because it makes them feel good then why wouldnt they just collectively produce luxuries based on shared resources im not sure that would be enough to encourage luxuries to actually be produced
socialism,not_removed,neither marx nor any first tier classical economist accepted the ltv as a valid theory for capitalist economies what
socialism,not_removed,i dont get youre argument as regards supplydemand or price marx never solves the problem of price which is related to exchange above or below its true value as per the problem of transformation i think that the supply demand solution you propose is dubious at best i think it also mildly betrays the idea that decreases in socially necessary labor time reduces the value of a commodity which is good for marx because it decreases the cost of purchase while the wages per hour remain the same it would make practical sense to reduce production if production exceeds demand but resorting to price manipulation assumes a competitive market scenario wherein the profits necessary for massive surplus extraction is required to sustain worker and owner alike production requirements set by the market rather than actual need for that labor and those commodities
socialism,not_removed,this needs more visibility the labour theory of value is the grounding of almost every critique against capitalism there is its socialist theory
socialism,not_removed,agreeing with umattsah here op labor theory is an explanation behind why commodities have certain values in exchange it essentially explains the bounding point where supplydemand have prices jump off in every which way it is specifically meant to explain capitalist economy
socialism,not_removed,i recommend the youtube channel which has a blog i think with extended material
socialism,not_removed,typically an infographic uses graphics to represent information in a clearer more instinctive or more appealing way what youve got here is a wall of text with clipart sprinkled around it
socialism,not_removed,could anyone put this in a form that would make a printable pamphlet actually more infographic pamphlets would be helpful in general thinking of passing some out during the protests
socialism,not_removed,op i like your effort theres a lot of good stuff here but i do think there are some problems values dont equal price not because supply doesnt equal demand the thing that pulls prices of production equilibrium prices away from direct prices prices proportional to laborvalue is not the lack of competitive conditions in fact its exactly the opposite prices of production deviate from direct prices as the laws of capitalist exchange assert themselves more and more that is as competition creates an average rate of profit across the economy the real reason why prices deviate from values is because of the different organic compositions of capital occ in each labor process the different proportions of fixed to variable capital set into motion different amounts of living labor and therefore their products embody different amounts of value but competition equalizes prices between commodities embodying equal amounts of capital not just variable capital so prices will deviate according to the different occs of production methods deviating about a mean represented by the average occ the point however is that these deviations between prices and values cancel out in the aggregate because the aggregate social product has by definition the average occ edit just wanted to emphasize the implications of that last sentence this means that prices do equal values in the aggregate so total prices total values also that total profit total surplus value that these equalities actually dont hold according to marxs math is the substance of the transformation problem obviously theres a whole debate about this im personally partial to approach to the problem
socialism,not_removed,seems like the response do far has been critical which is good id rather have be wrong and have to correct it than not being correct at all so any suggestions on how to make this better will be accepted
socialism,not_removed,do you have a source for im curious to see where that comes from
socialism,not_removed,aside from a big part of this being blatantly wrong i think it is a good example for how some ways of presentation arent suited for every topic even if youd correctly understood marxs theory it is obvious that even your misconstructed idea of it hardly is something that should be presented as an infographic some ideas are not meant for that and can only be conveyed in a running text
socialism,not_removed,wow this is so terrible shows the level of understanding the typical anarchist has of capitalism
socialism,not_removed,you should post this to rinfographics
socialism,not_removed,very well made thank you
socialism,not_removed,nothing is worth anything else but precisely what someone else is prepared to offer you for it at that moment
socialism,not_removed,labor theiry of value makes no sense because most value comes from the sun nature
socialism,not_removed,seconded if you pass this around why should anyone read past this sentence
socialism,not_removed,also commodities contain exchange value marx goes to great pains to show how value is nothing intrinsic to a good but a real abstraction of phantasmagorial form that is of social nature there are so many wrong points in this infographic that i dont even know where to start
socialism,not_removed,that was worded weirdly but its supposed to mean the ltv isnt to be followed by a capitalist economy its an explanation on how it works
socialism,not_removed,the transformation problem isnt about supply or demand but rather how you get from values to prices of production is a good piece of literature that adresses the transformation problem and provides a very good solution to it in my opinion excess supply just means that less capital will flow into the respective industry wheras excess demand means that more capital will flow into the industry both supply and demand are regulated by profitability
socialism,not_removed,i dont think this is super accurate its labor that creates value because labor is value it is the form social labor takes in capitalist society values substance is social labor and its magnitude is the duration for which social labor is applied at its socially necessary level labor power rather may create value in the sense that the purchase of labor power allows the capitalist to exploit labor producing value in excess of pay outs perhaps its more accurate to say that laborpower is the source of surplusvalue or the difference between laborpower and labor is the source of surplusvalue
socialism,not_removed,i thought laborpower was a commodity defined as the ability to perform labor that workers trade with capitalists in return for a wage how does this create value instead of labor in the abstract
socialism,not_removed,as someone who dissented against your treatment of price i still want to commend your effort here a lot of this is super well and good
socialism,not_removed,this would make sense if everything magically appeared at all times however because it doesnt all prices must have a relationship with the value of a good they are not the same thing a price bounds up and down around the value in labor a thing possesses the confusion garnered here is that in conventional economics price and value refer to the same things in labor theory they do not
socialism,not_removed,unextracted resources have no usevalue you need labour to transform them
socialism,not_removed,a mineral sitting in the ground has no value until the miner pulls it out grapes on the vine provide nothing until they have been picked it is not the existence that gives the value but rather the labor needed to force it into the economy
socialism,not_removed,youre confusing usevalue with value nature can give commodities usevalues just like labor can but only human labor can produce what we call value
socialism,not_removed,well aside from questions of political expediency theres also the fact that its patently false its not clear what the opauthor is claiming with this why exactly would marx have written so voluminously on something he felt was not a valid
socialism,not_removed,thirded how does op think surplus value is created and how does exploitation occur another shitpost trying to say that we either dont need ltv or that marxs ltv is radically different its not really for most purposes ltv has become like a sort of theory grail for amateurs if they can somehow prove it undisprove it then magically communism they just need to understand the no one has any decent theory of value that has anything close to consensus at this point and its an embarrassment to the entire field of political economy and still despite this we have capitalism
socialism,not_removed,yeah thats what i said but i moved onto supply and demand quickly acknowledging your point without trying to come off as hostile cant say ive read the whole book you linked since last night but there were useful points in there especially about the necessity of average prices for practical exchanges that dont have the time or interest in such accute measures of total labor per commodity all of which seem to be involved in capitalist measures of surplus value extraction even if they occur in limited quantities in any exchange scenario thanks for the link ill take a look at that more closely when i get a chance
socialism,not_removed,so a broomstick handcrafted by a master of the trade using a spokeshave has an inherently higher value than an machineproduced one from a slavelabour factory in the chinese gulag which in turn has a higher value than a fully machinemade plastic substitute cranked out at a thousand an hour by a capitalhappy plant in ningbo riiiiighht
socialism,not_removed,im not sure i follow can you explain please
socialism,not_removed,nope thats a misunderstanding of labortheory the value of a good isnt the makers labor time but the average time necessary to create an object by society what marx calls societally necessary labor time the faster it can be produced on average societally the lower the value in fact if you are incapable of producing a good at the average production time you are a less desired worker because you cant produce the desired quantity for exchange a capitalist must increase production thus lowering value in an effort to outcompete other capitalists who themselves produce more so they can lower prices over time their competition effectively destroys the value price and profit of a good if your interpretation were right everyone would only hire people who took forever so they could sell for more and would attempt to hire as few as possible to prevent profit loss that would be very backward
socialism,not_removed,i like him i love how hes obliterating the fake socialists theyve no chance
socialism,not_removed,i think he sounds like a social democrat and has no chance at winning but hes preferable to le pen and fillon
socialism,not_removed,based on his experiences in south america mélenchon favors the citizens revolution révolution citoyenne drawing additionally on ideas stemming from the french revolution and the paris commune and a new strategy that respects the democratic process while seeking to win elections in order to change the constitution this citizens revolution should lead to a reversal of the current division of wealth held by capital represented by shareholders and the working class understood in the broad sense of anyone who actually works to earn money directly additional goals include a new constitution that will initiate a french republic in which the president will have less power and parliament more increase wages a public bank created by nationalizing the private banks democratization through the establishment of new rights for employees allowing them to develop cooperatives the nationalization of large corporations environmental planning an exit from nato an end to the war in afghanistan and peace in the middle east through the creation of a palestinian state from wikipedia same old social democracy claims to be influenced by marx yet his platform is basically the gotha programme
socialism,not_removed,just another liberal socialism can only come about through revolution
socialism,not_removed,nationalization and a new constitution which grants more power to parliament are liberal demands and paltry and insufficient even if won they have nothing whatever to do with socialism
socialism,not_removed,democratization through the establishment of new rights for employees allowing them to develop cooperatives an exit from nato this looks like corbyn where hes close enough to outright socialism to be brushing up against the limits of being defined as just a socdem as in corbyns pursuing the former policy pretty much verbatim and the latter one is a bit too antiimperialist to be just a socdem move
socialism,not_removed,sounds better then le pen
socialism,not_removed,chavez would disagree
socialism,not_removed,even if she is it will not alter the material conditions that brought her into power in the first place there is no doubt that the lives of workers will be better under mélenchon and it would not be unbecoming of you to vote for him however his victory would not spell ours it would only delay our loss at best this is why i choose not to put too much faith into electoral politics as i believe it is very shortsighted
socialism,not_removed,there isnt a socialist position on how to be involved in electoral politics and even if there was one it would have such an insignificant impact there would have been no reason to publicly advocate for the taking of sides to begin with vote however you like or dont vote at all it matters little
socialism,not_removed,its not just their opinion
socialism,not_removed,hes not up against le pen france has a two round election where anyone can run in the first round and the top two from that round go to a runoff le pen has a dedicated group of followers that will get her about of the vote in the first round and francois fillon mainstream right but considered on the fringe of the mainstream having similar ideas about nonwhite nonchristians as le pen with the added bonus of being a self identified thatcherite and a traditionalist catholic who wants to reverse gay marriage ban gay adoption and restrict abortion will likely come in second the run off will be between le pen and fillon and it seems to be up in the air who will win since she is running to the left of him on social and economic issues she hasnt said anything about repealing gay marriage and she supports a welfare state for the right kind of french people either way it seems that minorities are going to be fucked by whoever wins the french election
socialism,not_removed,well it shouldnt trump was worse than clinton but it didnt automatically make her policies appealing and while i am in no way suggesting that mélenchons platform is equivalent to hillarys it does not change the fact that mélenchon is merely a social democrat and will not bring forth the change we desire at best it will succor the working class for a limited time before the cycle begins anew
socialism,not_removed,what do you want to hear hes definitely not a fascist but hes not a socialist
socialism,not_removed,and reality proved chavez wrong
socialism,not_removed,the musings of social democrats do not become more legitimate because they happen to have held positions of power
socialism,not_removed,this is where youre supposed to say youre not wrong youre just an asshole
socialism,not_removed,if you pick cooperative planning you are a petitebourgeois indvidualist opting for libertarian socialismdecentralized planning reject hierarchical authority gets called petite bourgeois u wot

socialism,not_removed,i think i am going to buy this game just to get the mod
socialism,not_removed,wow this looks really cool i play vic and other paradox games and i was considering buying this pretty sure you just pulled me over the edge will probably buy it soon also what benefits to the other socialist modes of production offer you only named the benefits for central planning
socialism,not_removed,do alien slaves count as means of production workers of this world unite
socialism,not_removed,will this be updated for
socialism,not_removed,ive been excited to play this since ive heard about it
socialism,not_removed,excellent thanks so much for doing this one thing that may be cool for the future is the ability to increase the power of factions in other empires ie to incite the creation of a socialist faction in another empire if it doesnt already exist due to shitty working conditions slavery etc and to increase its empirewide influence in order to disrupt these other empires and possibly cause an internal civil war the effect of this choice would probably be determined by some function over the ethics divergence of pops in the empire just a thought cant wait to play
socialism,not_removed,i just bought stellaris to try out this mod but im on apparently looking forward to trying it out when its updated im new to the game so im assuming i can just create a custom race at the beginning of the game and choose the type of government
socialism,not_removed,rejoice chains will be broken today nice to see it released
socialism,not_removed,goddamn ive been keeping my eye on stellaris for some time and suddenly communism looks like the optimal game to implement fully automated luxury gay space communism in as well i dont yet have the game so i cant offer anything on the mod itself but i know how much work goes into this sort of thing well done ill also echo what other people have said in the thread consider keeping your development on github or something so as to avoid any other losses of the mod in the case of harddrive failure or something
socialism,not_removed,i will be sure to give you feedback
socialism,not_removed,i really didnt care for stellaris all that much but this mod might make me give it another go exactly what i wanted at release now if only had a decent socialism mod
socialism,not_removed,thanks dude i will start a game with this today
socialism,not_removed,it is saying for me that the file is damaged and i cant unpack it
socialism,not_removed,where should i put it if i play on linux also put it on steam and github
socialism,not_removed,automated
socialism,not_removed,the password is spacecommunism
socialism,not_removed,enjoy
socialism,not_removed,wow thanks
socialism,not_removed,for now they are only slight improvements like more energy for marketplanning and more food and happiness for cooperative this is because i am unsure how this will effect gameplay so i have to keep them low for now balance is important in the future though i intend to make playing with each mode distinctive also individualists dislike central planning collectivists like it individualists prefer marketplanning but love cooperative planning as things now stand ai empires will always choose either cooperative or central planning depending on what ethos they have i am really not satisfied with marketplanning because right now this is why i instructed the ai to avoid it only someone who wants to roleplay should pick it it needs to be more distinctive
socialism,not_removed,probably in a week or so after i add some more goodies to the mod
socialism,not_removed,also waiting might try and roll back to to try this out
socialism,not_removed,cool you know this game has some serious potential and i learned a lot in the process of making the mod
socialism,not_removed,ive been thinking about making a new liberated worker pop type that all of your workers promote to after a revolution that can build factories that way we can include libertarian socialist forms of socialism too instead of only mls and socdems in victoria
socialism,not_removed,but its incomplete and dead
socialism,not_removed,well try instead
socialism,not_removed,try putting it here paradoxinteractivestellarismod
socialism,not_removed,luxury
socialism,not_removed,that sounds lovely
socialism,not_removed,i did once attempt a mod which made workers the owners of factories and rgos it was somewhat successful supplanting both the bourgeoisie and aristocratic classes however the workers quickly became too rich industrialising at an alarming rate and crashing the world economy
socialism,not_removed,thank you but i dont have a mods folder should i create one
socialism,not_removed,gay
socialism,not_removed,ive already added this if you are a free commune and most assemblies embrace radicalism there is a chance they will enact a diplomacy veto which prohibits friendly diplomatic actions towards counterrevolutionary regimes cannot guaranteesupport independence cannot sign nonaggression pacts and defensive pacts cannot trade on the other hand if most assemblies in free communes embrace conservatism there is a chance again they will enact a war veto which prohibits offensive war
socialism,not_removed,this genuinely made me laugh out loud
socialism,not_removed,haha even market socialism in results in op industry
socialism,not_removed,it doesnt exist by default documentsparadox interactivestellarismod
socialism,not_removed,nothing to see here
socialism,not_removed,communism
socialism,not_removed,doot
socialism,not_removed,comrade
socialism,not_removed,i am very curious as to what this comment was now
socialism,not_removed,though its long since disbanded httpsenwikipediaorgwikiblackpantherparty is a good example worth looking at originating as a group to protect black people in the community from police brutality and ensure their safety when the police wouldnt they were able to protect others because they were a part of the community they were protecting and they werent also protecting a capitalist state like police do
socialism,not_removed,there are some in pittsburgh we have the center for victims of violent crime and pittsburgh action against rape both of which can provide mediation and restorative justice services if both parties are willing but they are underfundedsupported and dont have much of an ability to bring unwilling perpetrators into the process
socialism,not_removed,historically it has happened the crips and bloods started as organizations to protect their communities from white supremacist gangs im unaware of any that currently exist though
socialism,not_removed,it would be interesting to have an organization in communities that followed police and film them at least while they are in public does anyone know of any programs like this that exist
socialism,not_removed,there was that really strange group of masked vigilantes i n seattle for a while im not sure if theyre still active heres one of them httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiphoenixjones
socialism,not_removed,have you or anyone seen the cell app im part of a few local groups but fortunately havent needed to actually use it yet
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately noble beginnings like that often end up sorta shitty
socialism,not_removed,uhhhhh citation
socialism,not_removed,seems good only downside is their goal still seems to be to perform citizens arrests
socialism,not_removed,loads in nyc for sure cop watch
socialism,not_removed,i originally wrote a paper about the us prison system in high school which is where i originally had the sources for this unfortunately they are lost however google found me this httpwwwsocialistalternativeorgpantherblackrebellionlosangelesgangsbloodscrips
socialism,not_removed,oh i see like instead of calling the cops you would call this group and they would help you out instead of shootingarresting you
socialism,not_removed,lmao that first line was a dead giveaway that this pamphlet doesnt care about facts if you asked crips how they got their name youd get answers raymond washington took the origin of the name to the grave with him and he sure as shit didnt start the gang on an egalitarian basis edit and sure as shit there wasnt a source to be found in the whole pamphlet
socialism,not_removed,the sources i had in for my paper said the same thing wish i had them but i dont they were sourced from whichever database my public school subscribed too
socialism,not_removed,this is good but trump just extended expedited deportations or whatever the euphemism is to include the entire country that means you dont get to see a judge or speak to a lawyer welcome to fascism
socialism,not_removed,if there any comrades willing to translate this into spanish arabic etc this could be very useful at organizing the defense of the most vulnerable of ice targets
socialism,not_removed,step form armed militia to free your brothers and sisters from this tyranny
socialism,not_removed,httpunitedwedreamorgthankdeportationdefensecardhandyphone
socialism,not_removed,this is not dystopian this is normal this is ok
socialism,not_removed,this covers an array of police encounters not just immigration
socialism,not_removed,thats not very militant
socialism,not_removed,we all know how fascism can be beaten
socialism,not_removed,yeah haha its kind of useless to a large portion of the target demographic
socialism,not_removed,might not have the best phrasing the in world i am better at translating the other way but it should be intelligible in order from the top left to right si un agente de inmigración ice viene a su puerta no abra la puerta calmese usted tiene derechos si el agente quiere entrar su casa pregúntele si tiene un orden firmado por un juez si el agente dice que tiene un orden pregunte verlo un orden administrativo de ice ice administative warrant con el título form no permite el agente entrar su casa si el agente no tiene un orden firmado por un juez usted puede rechazar su entrada si el agente usa fuerza para entrar su casa no resista diga toda la gente en su residencia para no decir nada si usted está arrestado no diga ni firme nada hasta que hable con un abogado
socialism,not_removed,so what this is trying to protect our comrades from fascists
socialism,not_removed,bash
socialism,not_removed,who wants to go camping maybe somewhere in the rockies or the appalachian mountains
socialism,not_removed,yeah but im not really going to support the expenditure of millions of lives for the sake of an illegal immigrant
socialism,not_removed,disclaimer not a native spanish speaker i tried to fix some stuff i tough was incorrect si un agente de inmigración ice viene a su puerta no abra la puerta calmese usted tiene derechos si el agente quiere entrar a su casa pregúntele si él tiene una orden firmada por un juez si el agente dice que tiene una orden pida verla una orden administrativa de ice ice administative warrant con el título form no permite el agente entrar a su casa si el agente no tiene una orden firmada por un juez usted puede rechazar su entrada si el agente usa fuerza para entrar a su casa no resista diga a toda la gente en su residencia para no decir nada si usted es arrestado no diga ni firme nada hasta que hable con un abogado it was completely intelligible tough
socialism,not_removed,its from the sub rmilitant i always forget how literal this sub is and how poor the sense of humor
socialism,not_removed,the
socialism,not_removed,do you call yourself a socialist if so and you believe what you say then youre a traitor to your class by not standing in solidarity with one of the most downtrodden groups in society
socialism,not_removed,this is great folks hope you dont mind some reformulations from a native spanish speaker to make the language flow some more si un agente de inmigración ice viene a su puerta no abra la puerta permanezca tranquilo usted tiene derechos si el agente quiere entrar a su casa pregúntele si tiene una orden firmada por un juez si el agente dice que tiene una orden pida verla una orden administrativa de ice ice administative warrant con el título form no permite al agente entrar a su casa si el agente no tiene una orden firmada por un juez usted puede rechazar su entrada si el agente usa fuerza para entrar a su casa no se resista diga a toda la gente en su residencia que no diga nada si usted es arrestado no diga ni firme nada hasta que hable con un abogado
socialism,not_removed,ah thanks for catching that for some reason orden was masculine in my head also not a native speaker i think you are right pedir is better than preguntar
socialism,not_removed,fash
socialism,not_removed,very clearly socialist fascism
socialism,not_removed,my generosity extends as far as my countrymen
socialism,not_removed,socialist fascism pick one cant have both
socialism,not_removed,define both of those terms please
socialism,not_removed,then i can tell youre no socialist why do you think were divided more by nationality than by class why should our solidarity only extend to people within our nation even though there are people within our nation who abuse and exploit us unlike mexican migrants
socialism,not_removed,the overuse of a word to apply to too many things can mean ot really only means whatever is common between all those things so really the commenter was saying very clearly thing i dont like thing i dont like
socialism,not_removed,oh were divided by both but ill always prefer someone that walks talks and sounds like me to someone i cant understand and has no interest in sharing my culture
socialism,not_removed,how can you just generalize an entire group of people how many mexican workers have you met or even talked to what youre saying is pretty contradictory honestly you understand that the upper class the ruling class exploits and abuses you as someone who works for a living but youd rather collaborate with them than with someone who is also exploited and abused by the same masters sounds incredibly chauvinist
socialism,not_removed,how can you just generalize an entire group of people i mean you could say the same about the opinion of the bourgeois
socialism,not_removed,i know there are good people in the bourgeois class but thats a complete false equivalency mexicans do not violently enforce a state of affairs that only really benefit them at the expense of myself and my friends nor do they alienate me from society mexicans do not seek to use and abuse me in order to accumulate wealth mexicans like me are one of the groups that is also alienated and exploited by the bourgeois class so i stand in solidarity with them
socialism,not_removed,mexicans do not seek to use and abuse me in order to accumulate wealth except the mere presence of illegal immigrants has an adverse effect on the social mobility of the lowest class of citizenry it takes two to tango they still need to accept lower wages in order to cut the lower class citizenry out of work also disrespecting the law is a nono cant trust someone whos first action is to break the law also why cant people decide who they want around i dont just let strangers into my house
socialism,not_removed,migrant workers didnt come over because they felt like it things dont happen in a vacuum the large majority of them used to be farmers before nafta which really fucked up mexicos economy corn was a big commodity in mexico and when cheaper american corn flooded the markets they lost their livelihoods yes i understand that they lower social mobility but youre blaming the victims of a larger system in play here who benefits from this very cheap labor certainly not the workers coming over here and certainly not you or me the law isnt an indication of actions that are good or bad just or unjust assume for a minute you lived in a place where there were no laws permitting selfdefense and someone attacked you with the intention of killing you would you just let them kill you because disrespecting the law is a nono similarly if you were faced with the option of going hungry and being homeless or crossing a border illegally to find a job to support yourself what would you do again this state of affairs where people are forced to break the law is a system imposed by the ruling class through violence you do not benefit from this state of affairs mexican workers do not benefit from this state of affairs so why would you collaborate with people who take advantage of both of you instead of the people in a similar situation as you or who are disadvantaged by the ruling class as you are dont let strangers in to your house then thats fine but why do you get to make the decision about where certain people can and can not live fight for a different world where mexicans coming to work in america benefits both you and them rather than disadvantages both of you
socialism,not_removed,nihilist white supremacy what a new interesting development in politics in the current year im not even going to bother to unpack this fucking shit i thought we could have a reasonable conversation but holy hell you can absolutely change your culture but its not even about changing culture its more about accepting the societal values of the nation you reside in which a vast majority of people do not have a problem with why should i trust someone thats given up on their home and if they havent given up on their home why should i let them in okay so theyre about to be homeless and go hungry but why should i stop that from happening im not starving or hungry why do i care about anyone else holy shit imagine for a second that was you in that situation i can imagine that youd do anything you could to stop yourself from being homeless and going hungry like at least try to grasp the fact that its american imperialism through nafta that is causing these workers to come here at the very least oppose nafta except its too late globalism is the next development of capitalism and we can not stop it at this point and the only solution as has always been the solution is to stand in solidarity with the downtrodden and fight for a different world
socialism,not_removed,revealing video but jason unruhe seriously
socialism,not_removed,rising above the masses is just in what way exactly the masses being mediocre in the first place and having to scrape by andor due because they cant is justified how
socialism,not_removed,that is not the reason i work hard
socialism,not_removed,competition justifies it it was called social darwinism since the nineteen century the idiotic idea according to which winners takes all all the mediocre masses were given was and is the hope to distinguish themselves as exceptional labour force or fall back into the nothingness they are
socialism,not_removed,you just called that idea idiotic social darwinism and i absolutely agree because as peter kropotkin brilliantly elucidated we may safely say that mutual aid is as much a law of animal life as mutual struggle but that as a factor of evolution it most probably has a far greater importance inasmuch as it favors the development of such habits and characters as insure the maintenance and further development of the species together with the greatest amount of welfare and enjoyment of life for the individual with the least waste of energy being in competition with each other is an aspect of darwinism sure however its not the only aspect and of the two competition and cooperation cooperation has proven to be the better for everybody consistently thus i fundamentally disagree with that idea that evolutionary competition justifies people dying in favor of economic competition that is an inherent feature of capitalism if anyone is actually interested in being better if in creating something truly great and wonderful and worthwhile then cooperation is absolutely necessary and this sense of cooperation is what socialism strives for in contrast to our current capitalist society
socialism,not_removed,elections are not only about who will run the country they are also opportunities to identify new constituencies build new coalitions publicize new arguments they are above all else plastic moments in the political life of our republic when everyday citizens—men and women out of office—can finally be heard the populists and socialists of turnofthecentury america never won enough votes to win a presidential contest or effectively challenge the twoparty system but they did push public discourse to the left
socialism,not_removed,there probably wont be any real shift until the london government actually starts to act if it does on the brexit vote
socialism,not_removed,spain will veto so i dont think it will happen
socialism,not_removed,im tempted to argue this point but ive done it so much already spain has no reason to veto
socialism,not_removed,wait why
socialism,not_removed,well id like to hear why they would what i keep hearing is that because of catalans and basques they will veto scotland but spain are only opposed to unilateral succession presumably scotland will vote for independence rather than violently or otherwise illegally secede so spain will have no problem the spain will veto scotland thing is a bit of a meme at this point
socialism,not_removed,they have already voiced hostility didnt catalonia vote i know that was called illegal but its not like spain isnt worried regardless
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,too little too late id wager he said it to appease psuv supporters i dont have high hopes
socialism,not_removed,i cant find any updates on this not even in the venezuelan press
socialism,not_removed,tbf it is a bit of a project i dont think hes abandoning it merely theyre trying to get a better plan than give it to the people fuck it
socialism,not_removed,its a good plan tho
socialism,not_removed,its a good plan tho
socialism,not_removed,from the speech you forgave santiago carrillo for everything even for meeting with stalin however you dont even forgive us for telling you what you were and what you are maybe carrillo had no choice but to tell yes to everything you demanded from him do you know what differences us from him we say no without fear we dont walk the lines you draw for us we are not the left of your order we want a different order and we want to change things
socialism,not_removed,the spanish rightwing psoe included obviously has been acting quite stupidly lately but what theyve been doing in the last days hits new records its going to be hard for anyone to think that theres any opposition beyond unidos podemos and the independentists
socialism,not_removed,tbh im super wary of podemos and its not a bit of leftwing rethoric which will reassure me
socialism,not_removed,off topic but pablo iglesias kind of looks like aphex twin
socialism,not_removed,my favorite part was when he told how poor people dont have big interests and capital to see for their interests that all they have are the institutions the same institutions the right wanted to privatize and that there are more potential thieves inside the chamber that out in the streets absolute savage
socialism,not_removed,he explained at a conference that that was a simplified form of bringing up the following thesis the old marxism said that the state and the laws are the instrument of the bourgeoisie to impose their will in society the laws are the rationalized will of the dominant classes but that couldnt explain institutios such as public healthcare so some later thinkers have been changing it to the state and the laws are the rationalized result of class warfare which explains better why there were strong social policies in western europe at the height of the soviet union while they have been getting removed as the left has lost influence globally
socialism,not_removed,sure they are the result of class struggle but as well the state allowed them to exist as they serve them as a safe net from the pitchforks
socialism,not_removed,this is basic stuff from lenins the state and revolution its not anything new in the transitionary period of the dictatorship of the proletariat the oppressive functions of the state machine are what the proletariat would smash the proletariat wouldnt smash things like universal health care or other such institutions that benefit the working class as a whole
socialism,not_removed,excellent socialist perspective on the anthropocene from comrade ian angus
socialism,not_removed,hey please dont post links to breitbart
socialism,not_removed,i understand how that could piss people off but isnt it a good idea to know who the enemy is and how they operate
socialism,not_removed,the upcoming extinction of our species pretty important right there
socialism,not_removed,someone already mentioned environmental decade so ill throw out my second allowing people to pursue what truly interests them regardless of their situation with more free time to do so as we eliminate unnecessary labor i believe we could see a golden age of sorts once people are able to do what they do best rather than whatever hole capitalism shoved them into despite their shape i always wonder how many beautiful minds are kept from reaching their full height because of how our society is structured it seems to me most all people have incredible potential but are often pushed into conformity or taken away from their talents as of now most of us just get to chose from the borgies todo list fuck that noise how unproductive is it that such a small subset of the population gets to do all of the brainstorming
socialism,not_removed,apart from the destruction of the earth poverty
socialism,not_removed,capitalism
socialism,not_removed,the endless contradictions of capitalism
socialism,not_removed,probably the mistreatment of the mentally ill the necessity of abortion and hunger
socialism,not_removed,over production
socialism,not_removed,there are a lot of big things that have already been mentioned but for me one thing in the near future it can solve would be the automation crisis or at least make the transition between human to automated machine workforce a lot smoother
socialism,not_removed,to end peoples suffering physically mentally and emotionally
socialism,not_removed,to be honest im quite scared at how close we are to completely destroying are planet with things like coal and carbon emissions
socialism,not_removed,i guess that is fairly important comrade
socialism,not_removed,i think were past the point where anything we do now could stop our planet from dying
socialism,not_removed,yep youre right capitalism is human nature i mean just look at how blatantly obvious markets workplaces and wage labour are in nature look at how wolves just sit around and starve to death unless someone in the pack offers them something in exchange for hunting or how primitiveindigenous societies were just starving and dying from lack of economic incentive and natural hierarchy until glorious colonial masters came and gave them civilization
socialism,not_removed,counterpoint cuba
socialism,not_removed,turns out you can say words in whatever order you want
socialism,not_removed,who let you out of the salt mines
socialism,not_removed,well the planet earth will still be around but we might be the next mass extinction
socialism,not_removed,that type of woke is called weltschmerz
socialism,not_removed,its like george carlin said the planets gonna be fine were just not gonna be on it
socialism,not_removed,i disagree ipcc predictions might be somewhat conservative but our current emissions trajectory is putting us on a path to which is awful but really not humanextinction fuel and thats not taking future advancements and acceleration of renewables into account the fact that global emissions have been practically flat for years despite gdp growth of is somewhat encouraging to say the least perhaps if china continues to expand renewables development theyll bring about a decline moreover framing the problem like the linkolas and mcphersons of the world do just encourages people to lose hope and become complacent its a dead end
socialism,not_removed,were actually in the middle of a mass extinction thats been going on for a few millenia we should just fuck off to space to have some kind of space communism
socialism,not_removed,some of the poorest nations recently agreed to reduce hfc production to help with climate change we wont reach extinction if we reach declining levels of but sadly the damage done to the great barrier reef and extinctions may never be completely fixed
socialism,not_removed,fuck that if we dont believe that were going down with the planet people are going to stop caring
socialism,not_removed,the biggest threat for me is ocean acidification compared to other aspects of environmental policy its sadly neglected our emissions will vastly fuck up oceanic food chains even if we start decreasing them asap and theres evidence thats already happening and given that lots of advanced countries especially japan dont even pretend to be concerned about overfishing its a bad sign for our food stocks and for the biosphere as a whole if we keep going the way we are this is part of why i chose biochem instead of marine bio for my majors program i really would rather be blissfully ignorant of the extent of our damage the hfc pledges are great news but they still only make up a very small sliver of global gt if only the paris pledges were stronger and if there were similar efforts for cooperation on sustainability outside of emissions reduction like flood prevention sustainable fishing antideforestation campaign i would be feeling more optimistic so maybe i should have qualified my initial statement more i dont think apocalypse is imminent but i do think that the capitalist paradigm of endless growth is the sort of nonsense that got us set on such a bad path in the first place and no matter how quickly we act well still be dealing with the consequences for many generations
socialism,not_removed,think you can outlive us ill show you planet
socialism,not_removed,automated
socialism,not_removed,i know its a little bit late but ill help you comrade that is why we are socialist isnt it
socialism,not_removed,its not even profit at this point renewables are basically costcompetitive and theres a lot more potential capacity for them at this point i think the fossil fuel industry is keeping denialism alive out of sheer spite why they dont accept reality and start investing in pv or wind is absolutely baffling its not even practical from the perspective of shortterm gain
socialism,not_removed,true that is another one of the fallacies the system depends on
socialism,not_removed,to be fair its not really an example of the fallacy the sunk cost fallacy is only applicable when the option thats been part paid is still more expensive even minus the cost sunk and unfortunately the habitability of the planet doesnt factor into your average coal barons bottom line
socialism,not_removed,response of the communist party of the philippines cpp to the fake news peddled by the fascist armed forces of the philippines afp cpp information bureau media advisory there was no npa unit involved in any way with the fire that struck valencia national high school in concepcion valencia city bukidnon last march the bureau of fire protection in the area itself confirmed that the fire was caused by faulty wiring and ruled the fire as an accident the ibs vain attempt to smear the npa by spreading outrageous lies and fake news is cheap and pathetic it smacks of their desperation to cover up their crimes including attacks on lumad schools and teachers and occupation of day care centers and other civilian structures afpfakenews

socialism,not_removed,gnv
socialism,not_removed,same
socialism,not_removed,likewise
socialism,not_removed,hey i live over in deland and im also anarchist small world
socialism,not_removed,do you by any chance go to ucf
socialism,not_removed,grew up there great town
socialism,not_removed,deland you have my condolences seriously though small world indeed i moved in a couple years back i love it here but the local gov is corrupt and incompetent as fuckso the usual for florida
socialism,not_removed,i did im in the area
socialism,not_removed,depends where you are lol
socialism,not_removed,true but they are corrupt everywhere and deland aint so bad we dont have beaches or ocean breezes but we both have a raging homelessness problem i actually moved here about a month ago because my parents wanted to and im going to college here is there any activism that goes on daytona
socialism,not_removed,i started a socialist group on campus this semester facebookcomkfsocialism if you want to get involved with us
socialism,not_removed,the ocean breeze is great ive actually only been to deland a few times once for a beer festival and a couple times for county things is there any activism that goes on daytona some we have faith who are religious but pretty much the only game in town for helping the homeless theyre reasonably actionoriented theres some black lives matter organizers that operate out of bethunecookman theyre cool theres also a local progressives group that my mom actually works for theyre a bunch of exbernie folks with interesting ideas and potential for radicalization but the rich asshole who runs the show is cancerous annnd theres a chapter of the iww here no idea if theyre active but im thinking of joining in the near future
socialism,not_removed,woah there is a lot here than i thought im going to check all that out after comic con thanks do you know where i can look up to see if they have any events
socialism,not_removed,httpwwwfaithvolusiaorg not sure where this one will go just walked out on a meeting about it a couple hours ago because the leader isnt accepting any criticism or changes to his creative vision just checked the daytona iww theyre long dead maybe orlando
socialism,not_removed,thanks so much i hope to see you at one of those events
socialism,not_removed,same
socialism,not_removed,paywall doesnt allow me to read the article
socialism,not_removed,failed implementation of communist ideas marxist ideology marxism is a methodology not an ideology communism isnt a set of ideas to be applied to society but a condition of society that occurs in the absence of classes the state and money stalinism cannot be adequately described as communism or an attempt at it in any sense because of its utopian idealist and antimarxist character which is what youre hinting at in the post stalinisms character was that of capitalism and thus the death tolls of the ussr prc cuba vietnam dprk etc would have to be added to capitalism if anything at all
socialism,not_removed,well i would attribute only a couple million to communist ideology itself personally because for example many deaths from maoist china werent from communist ideology but due to stupid things like the four pest campaign and i dont consider all of the movements that called themselves communist actually communist but if we are saying deaths from organizations we can somewhat reasonably call ideologically communist not that i would necessarily agree with it though then its likely about million however it must be noted that i do not count pol pot or the dprk if we did count them and other countries where it seems unreasonable to call them communist ideologically it would probably be closer to million i do count maos china stalins ussr vietnam cuba certain eastern bloc countries etc also like i sorta mentioned earlier lot of these deaths were things that in my opinion cant be attributed to communism as an ideology of course thats quite subjective
socialism,not_removed,stalin was a state capitalist not a socialist
socialism,not_removed,depends are fascists people
socialism,not_removed,how was stalinism antimarxist and idealist
socialism,not_removed,pol pot was the furthest thing from a communist that you could find he didnt even read any communist literature he was just a thug with a weird idea of paradise which he forced on people
socialism,not_removed,if you count those deaths the ones caused for the sake of the idealistic ambitious dreams of bourgeois nationalist romantics like mao stalin minh pol pot and the kims as deaths from communist ideology you are no communist these were all capitalist bourgeois states that butchered the working class and communism is not an ideology it is the workers movement the real movement and if you think it is merely some ideology or political sect dont bother labeling yourself a marxist
socialism,not_removed,if you just want to reduce all the people who were killed under actually existing socialist regimes to just fascists i guess all of the original bolsheviks stalin had killed were fascists huh
socialism,not_removed,are you trying to dehumanize a group
socialism,not_removed,yeah fascists are people which is what makes them so scary the fact that human beings can be driven to commit such horrific acts and learn to hate like an animal is something to be feared but i wont lose any sleep over the brutal tactics of the red army either
socialism,not_removed,i generally like that meme but this isnt the time or the place
socialism,not_removed,it was antimarxist in its idea that the law of value the driving force of capitalism could somehow exist in socialism it was antimarxist in its idea that socialism could exist in an isolated area of the world with backward conditions and not be subsumed by capital it was idealist in believing that the cpsu was connected to the proletariat that the bourgeois state would disappear once the capitalists had been defeated and poststalin stalinism was predicated on the idea that the soviet union collapsed due to ideological changes revisionism and not due to it reaching a higher stage of capitalism
socialism,not_removed,exactly why i dont count him
socialism,not_removed,pretty sure you misread what i wrote
socialism,not_removed,it was more of a fun way of asking do the deaths of nazi and other axis solidiers count toward the total count
socialism,not_removed,are you trying to defend them
socialism,not_removed,i do count maos china stalins ussr vietnam cuba certain eastern bloc countries etc also like i sorta mentioned earlier lot of these deaths were things that in my opinion cant be attributed to communism as an ideology of course thats quite subjective no i dont think i did
socialism,not_removed,nah killing nazis is a victimless crime in most cases
socialism,not_removed,i was sayingit from more of a liberals perspective its pretty dificultto convince liberals that the prc had nothing to do with communism i believe only million actually belong to communism in that these were things that are broadly in relation and can be attributed to communism as a movement also when i say communism the real movement to abolish the present state of things counts as an ideology i dont mean it in the idealist since but i would count such a movement in the broad way laypeople use the word ideology
socialism,not_removed,this is the rare case that i am sad that the left and the centerleft could not meet between themselves normallyi am against compromising with the center but they would fucking win if they united otherwise they get stuck with fascism or neoliberalism wtf
socialism,not_removed,this is the best tldr i could make reduced by im a bot french socialist presidential candidate benoit hamon and left party candidate jeanluc melenchon have failed to agree on a possible alliance in the upcoming presidential election the two men indicated sunday melenchon was a socialist leader for years until he founded the left party in criticizing the neoliberal turn of the socialist party hamon represents the left wing of the socialist party with a program more aligned with ideas than most socialist leaders and surprisingly won the socialist primaries therefore opening the door for a potential alliance version tldrs so far pms and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome top keywords
socialism,not_removed,they would tank the left even worse if they united hamon is basically asking mélenchon to step aside and clear the way for his ps trainwreck which would undoubtedly combine most of their support but drive away others who are sickened by the ps a compromised centreleft programme under the ps banner could never beat fn or macron the best thing to come out of this election will be a freshly radicalised movement around la france insoumise which would have been pushed in the direction of confusion and demoralisation if tied to the fortunes of the ps and hamon
socialism,not_removed,exactly im not a huge fan of mélenchon but im gonna vote for him i wouldnt have voted if he allied with hamon they also could have never united anyway since a lot of their programs main points are fundamentally different
socialism,not_removed,perhaps youre right i was unsure what hamon wanted it seems to me that theyre virtually equal in the polls so a unification should be a compromise between the two and not just the left rejoining the ps i think theyd still win united but you have good points alas cest la vie
socialism,not_removed,i get it in germany our leftist candidate sahra wagenknecht announced shed be willing to work together politically with martin schulz the other day and the negative reactions by rde liberals made it very clear that neither the spd nor their voters are allies of the left cant trust socdems
socialism,not_removed,anticivies ewwww
socialism,not_removed,what is an anti civvi
socialism,not_removed,awesome another example of why comedy and satire can never work for the right or for the privileged and those in power keep trying though
socialism,not_removed,theyre not that bad edit damn i wasnt suggesting everyone go and convert to being an anticiv ive met a few and though i thought their politics were wacky they were cool to hang around with and shoot shit with and had some interesting things to say yall are taking this shit too seriously
socialism,not_removed,anticivilization anarchists anarchoprimitivists still dont know the difference between the two
socialism,not_removed,theyre really really bad
socialism,not_removed,wouldnt they loathe the very medium we are using to communicate
socialism,not_removed,yikes
socialism,not_removed,well a primitivist literally promotes cultivating hunter gatherer band society while anti civ more broadly means being opposed to large scale civilization societies the latter leaves open more broad possibilities for different lifeways like horticulture and small scale agriculture animal husbandry including nomadism etc although it is idealistic ideological theres way more historical instances of abandoning large agrarian civilization for other means of subsistence james c scott talks a lot about it in the art of not being governed basically historically people have fled societies with heavily concentrated populations just as much as theyve progressed into them when people have found that their urban life has become more burdensom from heavy taxes or corvee labor or just want to flee military conscription theyve often had the option to flee to a hinterland or mountainous or hilly regions or otherwise regions not controlled by states and adopted barbarous and uncivilized means of living in fact i just read that it even happened in greece and rome all the time one example is when the huns came some romans undoubtedly from the underclass deserted their homes and took up the hunnic customs it was a more regular practice for greco romans to flee civilized society to join germanic tribes when you think about it whats most striking to me is that these days in modern industrial society theres virtually zero non state spaces to flee to when opting out of this society therefore one effectively cant opt out at all anti civ thinkers tend to associate this with being held captive
socialism,not_removed,not all anticivs are anarchoprimitivists anticivs are most often just opposed to masssociety an example of an anticiv nonprimmie would be wolfi landstreicher the situationist international also put out some criticisms of society
socialism,not_removed,theyre kind of annoying but theyre not dangerous sometimes they have something worthwhile to say
socialism,not_removed,theyre not dangerous because no ones gonna revolt to do something obviously opposite their interests like destroying civilization theyre idealists their ideals would be dangerous if they were achievable theyre not so theyre just laughable if they have worthwhile things to say i suspect they could be said without concluding that we must revert to some ancient way of life
socialism,not_removed,theyre pretty fucking transphobic
socialism,not_removed,this is the best tldr i could make reduced by im a bot the seattle police relationship with geofeedia dates back to august of when the company offered the police a powerful new tool software that would allow them to engage in quotperpetual monitoringquot of social media posts wall is described as the quotgeospatial social media expertquot the emails also show a geofeedia quotenablement specialistquot corresponding jovially with them offering in one instance a link to a special collection of social media posts related to the chinese visit to seattle on september when the stranger initially reached out to the spd for comment the department declined to answer further questions about its use of the software such as is data that is collected by geofeedia turned over to the intelligence auditor what happens if the subject of a criminal investigation is near or involved in a protest how is geofeedia data used version tldrs so far pms and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome top keywords
socialism,not_removed,hi i was wondering how prevalent is the socialist presence or other left ideologies in israel and expanding on that question how much has the mainstream political climate shifted to the right ive heard from sources about this topic and i just wanted to hear want a socialist on the ground in israel actually has to say
socialism,not_removed,do you no longer believe a two state solution is possible are there any aspects of the israelipalestinian conflict you feel leftists living outside of the middle east dont fully understand do you support the boycott divestment and sanctions movement
socialism,not_removed,deleted
socialism,not_removed,what does the status of the left in israel look like there how popular is it and how much power does it have in the country
socialism,not_removed,what tendencies are most prevalent for leftists there what are the various parties doing for the class struggle there do you consider israel a fascist state
socialism,not_removed,i cant remember the name of the group but i know that idf veterans who honestly speak out on their experiences as being esentially colonial storn troopers are often targeted as traitors in mainstream israeli conservatism do you think the idf as a draft army has a key role in the social transformation of the area and do you think veterans organizations may be more influential than the discredited left in the case of jewish israelis
socialism,not_removed,what do you see as the solution to the conflict do you think a jewish state has a right to exist in palestine
socialism,not_removed,if you spent most of your life in israel i assume you speak hebrew which is way easier for me sorry if you are not איך לפי דעתך אפשר לשפר את המצב הכלכלי בארץ ואת ההפרשים הסוציו אקונומים בכמה דברים פשוטים שהממשלה שיש לנו כרגע פשוט לא עושה
socialism,not_removed,how much do you know about british politics i was wondering what you think about what the media calls the anti semitic left a slander which farleftist british jews criticise for instance jackie walker who is also a jew said that holocaust memorial day should remember all who died not just the jews she was condemned by jewish labour society and expelled from the party for antisemitism ken livingstone was talking about the havaara agreement where he said hitler made a deal with the zionists for which he got the same treatment personally i think that for instance the way ken worded his reply was ahistorical and at the time silly to mention but i think its far from antisemitism corbyns support for palestine led to him being continuously called anti semitic terrorist sympathiser as well according to polls labour membership has the lowest level of antisemitic beliefs of all parties yet theyre being continuously flamed as such in one choir by the media the tories and jewish rightists and only opposed by jewish british marxists i cant wrap my head around what the processes are and why it happens what do you think is there a link with israeli politics here
socialism,not_removed,sholem aleichem comrade fellow jewish marxist here i actually have an austrian yichus too who and what are some jewish sources that you find inspiring have you read walter benjamin shimon dubnow
socialism,not_removed,hi thanks for doing the ama i have a friend whos thinking about joining the idf despite the fact that hes relatively progressive i expect the political culture within the idf is racist and right wing is that true also how many soldiers serve in the occupied territories my friend supports a two state solution and i dont think he would be happy about the brutality in those areas thanks for your time
socialism,not_removed,any thoughts on the idea of one democratic state
socialism,not_removed,what are your thoughts on the similarities and differences between settlerism and colonialism in israel vs settlerism and colonialism in canada
socialism,not_removed,hey what is your opinion on the popular front for the liberation of palestine pflp do you think its effective force against israeli occupation or a terrorist organization
socialism,not_removed,pakistaniamerican exmuslim female comrade here few questions how likely do you think it is that the palestinians will embrace leftwing ideology and a future palestinian state whether or borders will become socialist back when i was religious i knew several palestinian diaspora from our community the youth were leftleaning politically but the parents were outright rightwing libertarians ron paul supporters and all that of course there are always political riffs between diaspora populations and the population back home are palestinians in occupied palestine more leftwing or do they lean more towards the right why do you think it is that the palestinian struggle is so heavily littered with conspiracy theories my father is a hardcore conspiracy theorist who believes in the zogjewish conspiracy nonsense and pushed that shit on me and my siblings when we were teens when i did bds work while in college i saw a lot of the same tropes being repeated by people who were allegedly leftists specifically conspiracies about the nazis having been zionists jews willing to sacrifice their own zionists controlling the foreign policies of imperialist countries like the us uk and france etc from an israeli socialist pointofview why do you believe this happens and what can be done to counter it what school of socialism do you believe is applicable to the palestinians and their current situation marxismleninism trotskyism maoism leftcommunism anarchocommunism anarchosyndicalism or something nationalistic like baathism but softer etc what role does the presence of israelis within palestinian lands play in this
socialism,not_removed,we have a shared experience with acquiring a socialist view point from our professors its great how the state allows such radical out of the box thinking within colleges anyway so you are a nationalist and a socialist
socialism,not_removed,one of the most popular parties on the joint arab list is actually a joint jewisharab communist party called maki but it has very few jewish supporters left wing ideologies are at an all time low in israel the jewish population has shifted to the right since the when likud embraced the mizrahi middle eastern jewish population before that theywe were heavily discriminated against and there were joint mizrahiarab left movements like the black panthers that terrified the zionist establishment leftist ideas are losing ground in the palestinian population both in israel proper and the west bank to islamism because they have lost hope in the left to deliver freedom leftist and traitor are widely used as synonyms in mainstream discourse
socialism,not_removed,not only do i not believe that a state solution is possible since it would cause a civil uprising and perhaps conditions analogous to the bosnian war if some of the most radical settlers tens of thousands of people were told to evacuate i dont think that it is just to artificially divide this tiny land on ethnoreligious lines its a form of segregation i believe in one decentralizedconfederal state many western leftists do not understand much of the social cultural and religious peculiarities of the region and the conflict and see it as very black and white yes i absolutely support it
socialism,not_removed,thanks i try
socialism,not_removed,they used to be pseudosocialist racist communes now theyre just commercial farmstourist trapsguest houses
socialism,not_removed,its quite unpopular and powerless from a political perspective the main left wing party laborthe zionist union is pretty much a right wing party and at this point even the position of every major country states for peoples is considered a radical leftist view demographics dictate this will get worse as the most religiousright wing groups have a much higher birth rate than secular centerleft israelis who are also emigrating to america canada and germany in huge numbers
socialism,not_removed,the left still has a lot of marxist leninists which often leads to unfortunate things like supporting assad but thats mostly the old guard and the younger people who dont have nostalgiaadmiration for the soviet union reject that there are quite a few trots within the jewish left in tel aviv but the left here is very small and i think we all realize that its ridiculous to be sectarian and split into hundreds of acronymed groups over events that happened before our grandparents were born during the russian revolution or over whether we think that a stare that stopped existing before i was born was socialist a deformed workers state or state capitalist personally i identify a lot with httpsenwikipediaorgwikibundism and thus httpsenwikipediaorgwikiaustromarxism which many socialists back in the day didnt like but i personally think that it is the best and most sensible approach for the current reality of this land im involved with a group through my university dedicated to rediscovering secular yiddish culture which was forcibly snuffed out by the early zionists who wanted to create a new man and saw yiddish language and culture as emblematic of pathetic and helpless ghetto jews in europe and then completely destroyed during the holocaust and bundism is a very big interest in much of that group as for class struggle at this point the left is tiny so it mostly just either education or protesting the policies of the government toward the palestinians and towards refugees from africa who are treated like dirt and have been killed in the street without consequence no i dont consider israel to be fascist by the classical definition i consider it to be a right wing capitalist apartheid state eerily similar to south africa
socialism,not_removed,its called shovrim shtika breaking the silence the idf definitely has a role since it is widely respected as an institution at the same time since everyone has been through it the people with the dominant perspective nationalists will dismiss idf dissenters i know south africa had a draft army too does anyone know what role the all white afrikaner male sandf played in the struggle against apartheid
socialism,not_removed,i am drawn to it because i think its httpsenwikipediaorgwikinationalpersonalautonomy is not only the best solution for israelpalestine but for the world because it recognizes the deep held identities somemanymost people have and instead of fighting against them it detaches them from a geographical nation and facilitates living together some people liberals will say that israel is more left than america because even the far right supports our form of universal healthcare the government buys you insurance from one of four companies that are partially state owned and the fact that the state is largely involved in the economy — but thats because we have a perpetual war economy being against the occupation and conforming to international law states for people dismantling settlements leaving east jerusalem and the golan and ending the blockade of gaza is considered a radical antizionist position at this point gay marriage has majority support which shrinks every year as the religious grow and secular people leave but our family law is still the same as in ottoman times and therefore religious authorities control marriage and divorce and child rights refugees who cross from africa into israel are called infiltrators and there are weekly hate rallies against them in tel avivyeah it isnt good right now
socialism,not_removed,the solution is one multicultural and decentralized socialist confederation that respects the ethnoculturalreligious rights of everyone in the region that encompasses the entire area of the former british mandate of palestine that confederation should one say expan to encompass the entirety of the levant i dont think any state has an intrinsic right to exist but certainly not an exclusivist jewish state do i think jews have a right to live on this land and have a connection to it yes but so do arab muslims arab christians armenians druze etc etc so we should share the land
socialism,not_removed,i am not a nationalist i am a socialist colleges are great places because you get exposed to so many different ideas
socialism,not_removed,when it comes to combating nationalism are there any lessons that american leftists can learn from the rise of likud in light of trumps somewhat unexpected rise to power
socialism,not_removed,thanks for the response
socialism,not_removed,maki you mean hadash i thought makai was a party that existed
socialism,not_removed,thanks for the answers ive been watching fauda an israeli political thriller about the israelipalestinian conflict on netflix so far ive thought the writers did a pretty good job of presenting the conflict from a pretty neutral view if youve watched it what are your thoughts on the series if you havent watched it are there any palestinian or israeli filmsmoviestv shows youd recommend happy hanukkah if youre celebrating
socialism,not_removed,so the country is basically dominated by rightwing politics from what i gathered
socialism,not_removed,im a young man who admires the achievements of the ussr and a marxistleninist i dont support assad as baathism isnt socialism but realize isis or the imperialists should keep their claws out of it the socialists of rojava are entirely too dependent on the imperialist us so i cant really support them either but im not an israeli i mean the whole peoples judean front thing of life of brian thing shouldnt be happening but there are criticisms to be made from each line about other lines that are valuable to insight i mean i agree with lenin and stalins critique of bundism and austromarxism but maybe as to the material conditions of israel it needs to be looked at but arent nonjews officially represented in israel thanks for letting me know no unionization efforts or poor relief efforts that would probably help some leftists consider israel to be fascist based on the naked ethnonationalism so just wanted to get your opinion
socialism,not_removed,fair answer thanks for the perspective
socialism,not_removed,no problem
socialism,not_removed,i know of it but ive never watched it tv is out of my budget one movie i recommend is ajami its a dramatized film about life in ajami which is a mixed area of jaffa which was an arab city south of tel aviv but is now a jewish neighborhood of tel aviv due to gentrification and the government policies of judaizing that movie is palestinian written and produced so it has a more balanced view of things as opposed to so many israeli movies about multiethnic relations of any kind which use the same trope of secretly progressive palestinian leaves his regressive muslim home life and be friends progressive is raleys because israel is a progressive paradise in every film thank you of course i am who passes up a holiday
socialism,not_removed,communes in and of themselves are not socialist but communes that existed solely for the purpose of making colonizing a foreign land easier are certainly not socialist and neither is excluding anyone who wasnt an ashkenazi jew they disallowed arabs and mizrahi jews from membership now theyre not even communes theyve been privatized and are just commercial farms places for tourists to stay and do labor and guest houses for lone soldiers western young people who immigrate here without family for the sole purpose of joining the idf
socialism,not_removed,yes the pm netanyahu is seen as a rightist zealot by western left of centre media and people but the likud is the most moderate rightist party and he is a moderate in his party other parties in the government coalition are literal theocrats secularist far right nationalistsproto fascists who are mainly immigrants from the former soviet union yisrael beitenu as well as religious nationalists who have the annexation of of the west bank and ethnic cleansing of arabs in thei platform and are largely supported by settlers and american immigrants habayit hayehudi
socialism,not_removed,i think the ussr represented an improvement from the czar but it was very oppressive and not the kind of society that i would consider a friendly place for workers i think rojava represents an improvement but i think they need to appeal to non kurds more the us gives them help because theyre fighting isis just like the us gave the ussr help fighting the nazis our main union is zionist in character and there arent really any alternatives we have worked with palestinian labor migrants who come to israel to work in construction and on farms but theyre terrified of making any noise since they make much more money on this side of the green line than they would on the other side fascism isnt just nationalism its about an antidemocratic irrational cult of the nation and vertical class collaboration an illiberal quasi democracy that is nationalist isnt fascism by itself i take a specific view of fascism whereas others take it to mean any kind of nationalist state
socialism,not_removed,one movie i recommend is ajam
socialism,not_removed,just an update on rojava they recently dropped rojava from their name in favor of their new name the democratic federal system of northern syria this is part of an effort to appeal to non kurds as the arab population is becoming a huge part of their demographics as they are conquering new territories from isis heres the source
socialism,not_removed,id consider different depending on what period of time youre talking about nah its not just because theyre fighting isis though they either want a puppet state for easier control and theyll force their hand as they did before in regards to turkey or the destabilization of the assad regime which while bourgeois rejects us imperialist hegemony for easier balkanization and subjugation furthermore the lendlease deal while helpful didnt do much for the ussr compared to their production nor to the aid the uk got because the ussr knew the game of the us and everyone initially rejected an antifascist alliance proposed by stalin molotov and the people because they were hoping that hitler won or nazi germany and the ussr knocked each other out rojava needs to stop being dependent on the us and advocate for a multicultural secular dictatorship of the proletariat there is more that the left can do not just for palestinians which is important but for the poor in general in israel i know that but many leftists consider israel a fascist or near so state
socialism,not_removed,the assad regime which while bourgeois rejects us imperialist hegemony this is what im talking about wrt mls and assad yes it is against america and israel but the baathists murder their own people and run an essentially fascist by the definition of antidemocratic ethnic nationalist and a planned economyvertical class collaboration being against america doesnt stop them from being indefensible as for balkanizing syria why does that matter to be honest i would prefer the whole region to be united in socialism but barring that does syria or israel or lebanon or france have some kind of inherent right to certain borders no
socialism,not_removed,in brazil there now reigns a semifascist regime that every revolutionary can only view with hatred let us assume however that on the morrow england enters into a military conflict with brazil i ask you on whose side of the conflict will the working class be i will answer for myself personally—in this case i will be on the side of fascist brazil against democratic great britain why because in the conflict between them it will not be a question of democracy or fascism if england should be victorious she will put another fascist in rio de janeiro and will place double chains on brazil if brazil on the contrary should be victorious it will give a mighty impulse to national and democratic consciousness of the country and will lead to the overthrow of the vargas dictatorship the defeat of england will at the same time deliver a blow to british imperialism and will give an impulse to the revolutionary movement of the british proletariat truly one must have an empty head to reduce world antagonisms and military conflicts to the struggle between fascism and democracy under all masks one must know how to distinguish exploiters slaveowners and robbers in all the latin american countries the problems of the agrarian revolution are indissolubly connected with antiimperialist struggle trotsky antiimperialist struggle is key to liberation tfw trots dont read trotsky and you do as a marxistleninist thanks for trying to say im a nazi with the echoes httpswwwliberationnewsorglookbeyondusimperialismshype httpwwwpoliticoeuarticlewhythearabsdontwantusinsyriamideastconflictoilintervention look underneath the surface and then underneath the underneath balkanization effectively turns syria or what becomes of it over to the hands of the imperialist countries who would place more chains on it it hasnt helped iraq or the former yugoslavia syria isnt the same as the imperialist us or israel or france borders arent really a big deal to us as socialists but the thing it does matter in regards to imperialism and subjugation of workingclass masses
socialism,not_removed,holy shit you know its hit the fan when a bourgeois magazine like forbes is admitting its bad
socialism,not_removed,the best part is that i know some muppet will come in here and swear up and down that this isnt real capitalism or whatever doing the same no true scotsman shit that they accuse us of if forbes is posting articles like this then maybe your economic system is actually kind of shit just throwing that out there
socialism,not_removed,the decay spreads over the state and the sweet smell is a great sorrow on the land men who can graft the trees and make the seed fertile and big can find no way to let the hungry people eat their produce men who have created new fruits in the world cannot create a system whereby their fruits may be eaten and the failure hangs over the state like a great sorrow the works of the roots of the vines of the trees must be destroyed to keep up the price and this is the saddest bitterest thing of all carloads of oranges dumped on the ground the people came for miles to take the fruit but this could not be how would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up and men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges and they are angry at the crime angry at the people who have come to take the fruit a million people hungry needing the fruit—and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains and the smell of rot fills the country burn coffee for fuel in the ships burn corn to keep warm it makes a hot fire dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out slaughter the pigs and bury them and let the putrescence drip down into the earth there is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation there is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize there is a failure here that topples all our success the fertile earth the straight tree rows the sturdy trunks and the ripe fruit and children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange and coroners must fill in the certificate—died of malnutrition—because the food must rot must be forced to rot the people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river and the guards hold them back they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges but the kerosene is sprayed and they stand still and watch the potatoes float by listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quicklime watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze and in the eyes of the people there is the failure and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath in the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy growing heavy for the vintage years later and its still fucking happening credit for the quote of course to john steinbeck
socialism,not_removed,we need to build a new system one that will balance economic growth with sustainability and human flourishing i think i know where this is going a new generation of companies are showing the way forward theyre infusing capitalism with fresh ideas specifically in regards to employee ownership and agile management and the penny drops the response to capitalism is coops and the silicon valley management ethos aka more capitalism on the other hand startups have been willing to distribute equity to employees sometimes such equity distribution is done to make up for less than competitive salaries but more often its offered as a financial incentive to motivate employees toward building a successful company we should know by now that this is no more anticapitalist than the kibbutzim were these companies are still running for private profit and surrender to the market putting aside the obvious many of these employeeowned businesses dont allow unions others are confined to mentallabor enterprises where the employees are more of a labor aristocracy than a class conscious proletariat google is a famous example of a firm which allows creative freedom for its prized techies while still relying on superexploited immigrant labor some of these sv startups have weird culty vibes and control how people live and spend their earnings from the equity then of course the article ends by extolling mondragon the capitalists favorite coop which trades in financial assets and exports industrial commodities to the third world sorry to shit all over this article but what kind of socialist would i be if i didnt criticize forbes
socialism,not_removed,so is this enough evidence to say the communism starvation meme is bullshit
socialism,not_removed,the motto of the next revolution will be simple a demand for peace land and bread
socialism,not_removed,shits getting bad when forbes is saying capitalism isnt working huh
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately with automation the wont need us anymore so they wont care unless we fight back
socialism,not_removed,i cant read the article because i have adblocker installed
socialism,not_removed,why is this in forbes
socialism,not_removed,this is utter nonsense and many intellectuals have been making predictions that humanity would run out of food by this year every single one of them were wrong the most famous of these being the economist malthus who predicted the earth would reach its maximum sustained population by the mid he was obviously dead wrong it is natural for humans to want to innovate invent and try new methods to make work more easy and productive in the it was large increases in productivity in the agricultural sector that lead to a sustained population explosion
socialism,not_removed,forbes site is sort of like huffpo in that its more of a blog host than anything theres no real editorial requirements for publishing something there
socialism,not_removed,never read grapes of wrath but damn
socialism,not_removed,exactly the author is not arguing that we do away with capitalism he says that if we tweak our organisational structures a little bit we can avoid the ongoing climate crisis seems more like a way to lure in and then appease wouldbe socialists than any kind of systematic critique
socialism,not_removed,no this is entirely a different prediction than malthus malthus did not count on the discovery of new fuels true we escaped the biological limits of the old regime in the midlate by discovering artificial fertilizers and beginning to use fossil fuels by not having to use potential farmland to grow fuel and by no longer being forced to leave fields to lie fallow between seasons human societies beginning with britain were able to dramatically increase the productivity of a smaller amount of farmland these innovations however began a soon to be irreversible climate change yes it is natural for humans to innovate and invent new solutions to their problems under capitalism however the drive to profit trumps all other human and ecological considerations and there is no sufficient motivation for societies or individuals to curtail environmentally catastrophic yet profitable processes the problem is not a lack of innovation it will not be solved by a technological hack evidence of little more than the bourgeois faith in technology the problem is capitalism
socialism,not_removed,still with the name of forbes on it it leaves something of an impact also communalism with anime characteristics does this mean that the revolution will have super saiyans
socialism,not_removed,and silicon valley is in no way more socialistic its just a different organizational structure
socialism,not_removed,the drive to make a profit and the drive to be more ecofriendly are beginning to converge as more and more consumers place higher concerns on the environment businesses are responding more and more companies are switching to recycled material adding solar panels and are pushing more initiatives to become more ecofriendly like it or not the drive to become a more ecofriendly planet is not coming from government policies which are largely controlled by special interest like big oil but from emerging companies like teslasolar city that are actually making it convenient and affordable to have solar panels and electric cars
socialism,not_removed,nah having people with superpowers is too hierarchical the anime would be more like a futuristic sliceoflife show like aria or something giving everyone super powers would also cause trouble too see shinsekai yori
socialism,not_removed,communalism with anime characteristics nani sore
socialism,not_removed,the wealthy parasite scum just reside in chic apartments and wear loosefitting expensive tshirts rather than remote woodpaneled mansions and tailored suits
socialism,not_removed,the problem with this argument that conscientious consumers will force businesses to engage in sustainable production is that it places power only with those who have money the living conditions and environments of those without money remain at the mercy of those with it yes consumers are becoming more ecologically conscious but the consumer in a capitalist society cannot by their purchase choices hope to stop the ongoing problems of overfishing pollution and depletion of freshwater resources overfarming deforestation cyanide leaching from mining and climate change mining companies for instance have a systemic habit of declaring bankruptcy after extracting a sites mineral wealth and leaving the cost of cleanup to the public purse capitalism has no adequate mechanisms against this tendency or similar thefts of the commons and no elon musk cannot save us singlehandedly and youre absolutely right that the state at present props up many ecologically disastrous industries such as coal and oil socialists however differentiate between a capitalist state which serves capitalist interests and one which serves the interests of the common people a bourgeois state serving the interests of corporate property and capital is very different from the workers state we envision
socialism,not_removed,goku is a comrade and the spirit bomb is a unification of the common man against imperialistic forces i will not stand for the slander of comrades
socialism,not_removed,i dont know what either of those series are but you seem to be insinuating that the revolution wont have cool beam attacks in it comrade
socialism,not_removed,i remembered shinsekai yori really great take on the concept of humans with powers and its dangers though if i remember correctly the reason there was trouble was the fact that only a tiny percent of humans received powers and then wiped outgenetically modified the rest would the situation be different if everyone had been given powers
socialism,not_removed,marxsempai watashi was daisuki
socialism,not_removed,chic penthouse apartments or multithousand sq foot apartments i live in an apartment lol and it looks nothing like theirs but its quaint and i love it
socialism,not_removed,much of the reason for the disastrous environmental conditions of poorer regions of the world is not the money power dynamic as much as it is general ignorance or indifference to the environment i dont use the term ignorance in a highly negative fashion but more as a simple fact that many simply dont understand the consequences of certain actions ive lived in world developing countries before and it is very common for workers to litter poop in the street and show a lack of concern for the environment in general however it is improvingbut very slowly incomes and standards of living across most developing nations are improving and as incomes rise concern for the environment has as well unfortunately though many of governments policies are too focused on promoting big pollution causing industrial growth over that of more ecofriendly companies
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,the spirit bomb is a unification of the common man against imperialistic forces your dialectic is clearly a step beyond mine senpai
socialism,not_removed,aria is a somewhat utopian slice of life set on a terra formed mars in the century shinsekai yori is about a world set years from now in an agrarian society where people have psychic abilities this society formed after percent of the worlds population gained psychic abilities prompting great conflict and strife and ending in a victory of the psychics theres also some darker stuff involving genetic mutation and well class conflict
socialism,not_removed,would the situation be different if everyone had been given powers if you could kill someone with a thought every social interaction would be some mutuallyassured destruction shit i dont see how a society like that would be stable or how everyday interactions wouldnt be coercive
socialism,not_removed,apartments originally housed people that were unwilling or unable to purchase a house ugh private property now they are in vogue with the wealthy the rich really do ruin things granted vertical housing is far superior to singleresident buildings though we do have a lot of unoccupied space in the midwest transit is started to get to a point where it could be feasible to extend communities in to those regions
socialism,not_removed,the majority of the businesses in world countries are from the developed western countries all those factories that used to pollute the air at the industrial revolution those are not gone but simply outsourced in countries thanks to imperialism and the power of money those high standards of living and income you talk about can only be achieved in capitalism as long as someone else is being exploited those governments policies are a direct effect of that
socialism,not_removed,gohan going super saiyan is clearly a metaphor for dropping liberalism and turning to socialism
socialism,not_removed,shinsekai yori is about a world set years from now in an agrarian society where people have psychic abilities this society formed after percent of the worlds population gained psychic abilities prompting great conflict and strife and ending in a victory of the psychics theres also some darker stuff involving genetic mutation and well class conflict so its xmen only realistic
socialism,not_removed,they genetically modified each other to be unable to harm humans without feeling immense pain themselves the show is incredibly well thought out
socialism,not_removed,uclydethefrog is exactly right thirdworld and developing nations are only developing because they are undergoing primitive accumulation capital in the form of western corporations has exported its own set of social relations and relations to nature to these places changing the relations local people have with each other and with their land
socialism,not_removed,notice the red and black screen for a split second thats militant antifascism kicking in
socialism,not_removed,they can only manipulate the world around them so not really and by victory of the psychics they mean all nonpsychics were completely wiped out the entirety of society has these powers which would typically make them too dangerous blowing someones head off is something one could easily do in a fit of rage so they used their powers to genetically encode an inability to harm humans its imo the best anime ever produced and is strikingly politically conscious
socialism,not_removed,i only watched the first couple episodes so far wasnt aware of that
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,especially the big reveal about who the mole people are edit forgot to tag spoilers thanks comrade uantabaka
socialism,not_removed,im sorry if that was a spoiler i thought it was introduced incredibly early on
socialism,not_removed,and in that moment he became just as bad as cell
socialism,not_removed,totally agree but you should edit out that last line big spoiler
socialism,not_removed,nah its cool
socialism,not_removed,its more brave new world than the truth isnt hidden its buried under a mountain of trivia its not illegal to read alternative viewpoints why make it illegal when everyone is busy reading trivia is being kept in reserve just in case the brave new world strategy fails there are elements of already in place the neverending military and state police funding but our rulers would much prefer us all police ourselves rather than have to do it themselves as history has taught them i agree with everything else though
socialism,not_removed,first of all of your going to attempt something of this caliber i would refrain from using colloquialisms such as bourgies and uber second im not sure what you mean by artificial when referring to the middle class while most here would agree that when examining the relationships between people and the means of production a middle class does not exist however a group exists whose aims interests do not fully align with the people and whose support should merit scepticism in the event of a revolution finally there is this the bourgies currently are crushing us on all points theyve managed to destroy class consciousness by destroying the labor movement and massive indoctrination socialism is a dirty word that you cant even mention in most places without being considered some sort of terrorist they destroy solidarity by using the mass media and the police state to promote racism getting all these groups fighting each other instead of the bourgeoisie class conciousness isnt as beaten as you claim people are highly aware that the bourgeoisie do not share their interests which has led to a surge in the use of the phrase job creator also if you examine the language surrounding the trump campaign you will see a tendency to avoid his privileged upbringing and somehow paint him as a man of the people the biggest piece of evidence is also your last point i agree that people in the streets would increase our support but not due to an increase of class consciousness bearing witness to the revolution increases the efficacy of the people not their consciousness if the people support revolution because they had witnessed it then they probably already agreed with most of the points they knew what the problem was but they were unaware of the solution i think i stand alone on this forum when i say that revolution could happen tomorrow look at the apathy if you examine it closely you will find that it is caused by in one word capitalism we have an opportunity but if we continue to act like syriza and karl kautsky then we will lose it
socialism,not_removed,how do people deal with upper middle class people my friends who dont care or think that the system is fine what are your best talking points and telling them about people dying and such is not going to sway them
socialism,not_removed,communists dont build the revolution the revolution builds communists
socialism,not_removed,well the proletariat will bring revolution when they bring revolution communist have no play in that all we can do is support it when it comes by fighting counterrevolutionaries and striving for international revolution and immediate communism aka when revolution happens start doing communist shit while making procapital people obsolete
socialism,not_removed,class consciousness solidarity does this have any real world application or is it just really fun to say ive still yet to be convinced of the concept that consciousness is needed for a revolution
socialism,not_removed,the truth isnt hidden its buried under a mountain of trivia trivia is such a fitting word i feel like whenever i talk about socialism im expected to be so familiar with what i could only describe as trivia about the soviet union and other marxistleninist states and if i happen to be unfamiliar with such trivia my criticisms of capitalism are dismissed as irrelevant
socialism,not_removed,just saw a video on facebook where they did the typical onthestreet interview of a bunch of looking people who didnt know who won the civil war or who the current vice president is you gotta figure they edited out most of the people who could actually answer those questions obviously but the second half of the video was asking the same people trivial shit like who the last three people ben affleck dated were and they all answered that crap correct instantly
socialism,not_removed,i think i stand alone on this forum when i say that revolution could happen tomorrow i think it could but it probably wont
socialism,not_removed,when revolution happens they either will side with the proles or they wont and if they dont they are your enemy
socialism,not_removed,how do people deal with upper middle class people you dont you look for the people who will benefit the most
socialism,not_removed,what does this even mean that after a revolution randomly starts that people will become communists as a result the idea that the revolution is inevitable is theoretical nonsense capitalists have found ways to pacify us and keep a revolution from ever happeningi addressed a lot of these above we shouldnt just sit around idly stating phrases like the revolution will build itself and hope that the bourgeoisie stamps on the throat of the worlds workers a little harder until they get desperate enough to start a revolution im no blanquist but spreading revolutionary conciousness wasnt an accident it was the concious effort of hundreds of revolutionaries from the theorists to the people fighting on the ground i cant stand seeing things phrases like this after reading huey p newtons autobiography who conciously set out to improve his community and make the world a better place we already have the material conditions to transfer to socialism right now food housing poverty are all artificial problems created by capitalism if we seized the means today we have the capacity to reorganize things so that these are moot so no the material conditions point is simply wrong passively waiting for a revolution to come someday is borderline immoral
socialism,not_removed,flair checks out
socialism,not_removed,how is it not a revolutionactual ones not rpoliticalrevolution s is where one class of people is disenfranchised and another class takes it place french russian english haitian cuban american revolutions all had a massive classconcious movement that was the driving force behind it can you name me a revolution wo class conciousness
socialism,not_removed,probably if it was going to happen tomorrow wed know but i was referring the tendency to claim that revolution in america will not happen in this generation its very similar to the line pushed by the second international about the minimum and maximum programs
socialism,not_removed,out of my friends of them will be on our side of them will stay home and be radicalize after he revolution and then there is who will definitely fight for them
socialism,not_removed,it blows my mind that youre being upvoted like this is marxism communist do not make revolution the revolution will happen spontaneously by the proletariat the proletariat has no ideology their movement is communism the abolishment of capitalism is communism but to think ideological communist can build a revolution is nonsense
socialism,not_removed,well firstly i think you have a misunderstood view of class consciousness class consciousness is outside of ideology and it is caused by their material conditions not by some ideological leftist throwing theory in their face secondly your view of revolution is faulty too especially when it comes to communist revolution the proletariat is not going to take place of another class they are going to abolish classes the proletariat arent looking to become the ruling class they are looking to abolish themselves and capitalism entirely the dictatorship of the proletariat is their selfabolition it is them making capital obsolete
socialism,not_removed,is where one class of people is disenfranchised and another class takes it place what a revolution is when a class of people are disenfranchised and another class takes the place of that class of people who are disenfranchised im confused as to what youre actually saying here french russian english haitian cuban american revolutions all had a massive classconcious movement that was the driving force behind it no they had conditions in which laid the foundation for an oppressed class of people to revolt against their oppressors they didnt revolt because enlightened sophists came to their doorstep to spread the good word the entire idea of spreading class consciousness makes us sound like jehovah witnesses trying to recruit people for our missionary trip to cambodia and its not a coherent position to take in the first place you cant enlighten the proletariat to revolution in fact i cant name a single revolution in history where this concept has been applicable it just seems to me to be some objective or mission for socialists to focus on in nonrevolutionary times so they feel like they have something to do with themselves
socialism,not_removed,i have some of those a lot of my family is petty bourgeois including my dad who would support workers though revolution will be a time of hardship i have several friends who are petty bourgeois and of my family only my mom is not one literally all of my uncles are my in laws are like we are fucked lol
socialism,not_removed,the proletariat has no ideology christ ideologys a hell of a drug
socialism,not_removed,ive read books by him and im even in the process of contributing state and revolution which i just recorded this week to librivox regardless of this phrase he worked actively to establish communism for years he didnt wait around for conditions to get worse
socialism,not_removed,the whole point of a vanguard party is that a smaller group of classconscious or politicallyadvanced people work to bring the larger masses of less classconscious workers into the communist movement the vanguard party is not separate from the working class but rather a polticallyadvanced section within it it is the central purpose of a vanguard party to agitate and raise the consciousnesses of workers who are primed for revolutionary politics due to their material conditions
socialism,not_removed,class consciousness is outside of ideology and it is caused by their material conditions i dont disagree entirely but plenty of people have become classconscious without being in a desperate situation plenty of revolutionaries came from priveledged backgrounds secondly your view of revolution is faulty too especially when it comes to communist revolution the proletariat is not going to take place of another class they are going to abolish classes the proletariat arent looking to become the ruling class they are looking to abolish themselves and capitalism entirely in the stage of communism or full communism you are correct but not in the stage or the transition the transitionary stage will absolutely have classes the working class will be in power ie the dictatorship of the proletariat phase and will oppress and stamp out capitalism the state machine and its bureacracy the no classes stance ignores completely the necessary transition although of course that is the final goal
socialism,not_removed,revolutions mean one class that was the ruling class were superceded by another the bourgoiesie replaced the feudal lords to become the ruling classfrench english sometimes one bourgeousie replaces anotheramerican sometimes the workers replace the bourgeoisiecuba haiti no they had conditions in which laid the foundation for an oppressed class of people to revolt against their oppressors again im not saying that material conditions arent a factor but our current society could easily maintain high concentrations of wealth while still doing just enough to keep people from revolting on the edge of desperation without revolting even with scarcity being completely solvable is something that the ruling class seems to have perfected your logic seems to me as follows should we help the working class nah lets just sit back until they get desperate enough hopefully the bourgeoisie will stamp on them a little bit harder then theyll have desperateenough conditions to do something about it what reason do you have to think that workers will get desperate enough
socialism,not_removed,do you really think a class has a coherent ideology that they all posses is not communism a material movement
socialism,not_removed,the goal of socialists should be to direct the revolution toward something meaningful almost no socialist revolution happened solely due to the actions of socialists when the people decide that theyve had enough its our job to direct their anger toward productive and meaningful change
socialism,not_removed,it is true that individuals can become conscious of their class by theory but we are talking about the proletariat i dont buy into the whole two stages when select elects of the working class come into power to dictate how other workers must produce is still capitalism with those in power becoming the new bourgeois the bourgeois are the personification of capital itself they are nothing without capital as is the proletariat the continuation of employing the modes of production under capitalism exist even when workers control the state the problem isnt with the organizational methods workers control is only one aspect of communism but communism is only fully realized when capital in all its forms are abolished this includes wagelabor exchange economy and so on thus there can be no stages of communism there exists either communism or capitalism and just because a workers party has replaced the bourgeois party does not mean the proletariat are in control all it means is that they now exist in state capitalism the dictatorship of the proletariat will be the communist revolution itself where they effectively kill themselves that is abolish themselves as a class
socialism,not_removed,sometimes the workers replace the bourgeoisie implement another capitalist nation statecuba haiti ftfy again im not saying that material conditions arent a factor but our current society could easily maintain high concentrations of wealth while still doing just enough to keep people from revolting on the edge of desperation without revolting even with scarcity being completely solvable is something that the ruling class seems to have perfected yeah historically but this isnt sustainable capitalism will collapse because of its own inherent contradictions its a fundamental aspect of how capital functions the entire system is not sustainable especially not for very much longer for instance even most mainstream economists are predicting another recession possibly worse than within the next years tops and with the rate of profit continuing to decline and capital becoming more and more centralized into the hands of ultrawealthy billionaires we basically can sit back and watch as capitalism brings itself to its knees the question isnt whether or not revolutionary conditions will arise they will the question is whether we need to have an organized proletariat to know what steps to take to abolish what is needed to be abolished to reach a postcapitalist society i think organization is needed and i think a vanguard is ultimately required to carry out the necessary steps needed to have a sustainable and successful revolution but i have yet to see why these wont arise organically out of class struggle itself or why we need to spread consciousness in nonrevolutionary times to be sure that the proletariat will revolt when capitalism inevitably falls
socialism,not_removed,im still waiting for librivox to appoint me a coordinator but the thread is created ill make a post on rsocialism when this gets published
socialism,not_removed,we basically can sit back and watch as capitalism brings itself to its knees yes but its pretty easy for capitalism to stand up from its knees it survived many recessions depressions and two world wars or do you think this is the final crisis where capitalism arrives at its own inner border but i have yet to see why these wont arise organically out of class struggle itself or why we need to spread consciousness in nonrevolutionary times to be sure that the proletariat will revolt when capitalism inevitably falls ever heard of reaction and fascism they are like the hedgehog to our rabbit always already there and well placed when we arrive on the scene to give reactionaries and fascists more advantage than they already have is a terrible idea if i ever heard one
socialism,not_removed,i think the defense against the fall of capitalism that is social democratic reform is ultimately losing its effect theres not much more regulating and the bread crumbs to toss towards working class people who are receiving lower wages than ever while the richer are getting richer are running out the only reason capitalism survived through the hoops and hurdles of the earlymid is because they had keynes to come along and convince capitalists that they need to actually engage in a little bit of public spending to keep a constant velocity of money and a healthy economy with the rightward pull of neo classical economics and the keynesian ideas of the last century starting to unravel yes i think think were going to be approaching another period of mass civil unrest within the next years the current state of things just isnt sustainable any relatively honestly economist will tell you this as for fascism the solution fascists are proposing is functionality no different fascism is a movement of the petite bourgeois and offers the same problems and failings of capitalism because fascism is capitalism unless you think the mass of the working class are just way too stupid for their own good i have no reason to think that a revolution in a time of worldwide economic crises would result in fascismremember fascism didnt come about through revolution i think if the majority of socialists in this sub would come down from their ivory tower every so often they might realize that workers dont need a bunch of academics and college kids to tell them that capitalism is shit they dont need to be spoon fed posturing by orgs to understand what they experience every single day of their life
socialism,not_removed,i think the defense against the fall of capitalism that is social democratic reform is ultimately losing its effect well this has been going on since the early together with the unraveling of keynesianism i dont see it having any hightening effect on the combativeness of the working class its rather the other way around re fascism this argument is terrifying the question is not if fucking fascism has any solutions to the crisis of capitalism the question is if a crisis will lead to fascism and to the earth burning down around our ears the question is how many millions or billions of people will fucking die if the ruling class can save itself and capitalism another time using some form of fascism i think if the majority of socialists in this sub would come down from their ivory tower every so often they might realize that workers dont need a bunch of academics and college kids to tell them that capitalism is shit they dont need to be spoon fed posturing by orgs to understand what they experience every single day of their life you need to be careful not to fall into some form of idealizing wage workers in my experience of seven years as a forklift driver most people are filled with bourgeois ideology sure hating the boss moaning about the work living for the weekend and the holidays thats there in nearly everyone but thats not the same as an understanding of the social relations under capitalism and it is even more important no revolutionary class consciousness the business i worked for went under last year and people got angry and desperate but when i tried to talk with my colleagues about the reasons behind this all they ever said was it was bad management ive given so much of my life for this firm and thats how they thank you for always following my duty true statement everyone knew that i was a socialist and people would sometimes listen to the things i said but it was always with this oh no hes talking dangerous stuff now how do i get out face on people get into all kinds of escapism from their shit job with shit pay and their constantly instable living situation mostly its the soccer league and betting on the games others play lottery ritualistically and some drink too much no one of my colleagues was organized in anything more than the trade union and even that was only about of all wokers there all this can change radically of course but not starting with the current conditions of the consciousness of the majority of workers
socialism,not_removed,thats a tough one websites magazines books pamphlets etc are usually written for native speakers not for education purpose you could try rfrance a few socialists hang around there you could also try magazines like httpwwwalternativelibertaireorg or httpswwwmediapartfr or even some books by bourdieu like sur la television
socialism,not_removed,good need more antifa how could any comrade be against antifa
socialism,not_removed,good good andyeah good despite the handwringing by some liberals over free speech we can all take comfort in the fact that history has proven us correct on this subject
socialism,not_removed,i am often present alongside antifa at the counterprotests in melbourne let me hit you with a dose of reality here leftist groups in melbourne are small we have a few with which a couple of thousand people actively engage with and theres a ton of overlap between them nationalistracist groups are fucking huge they have a lot more comparative social media activity when they organise they can pull in a lot more people than we can their membership is very rural while ours is very urban so things usually tend to end up evenfavourable to us but make no mistake the reality of it is a lot more bleak they gained the brunt of their membership long before we started opposing them regularly they got publicity in the media long before we started opposing them regularly they were recruiting in the streets long before we started opposing them regularly their growing popularity is not being helped along by us daring to violate the tenets of liberalism that so many socialists here seem to espouse their rise was already meteoric armchairs should not be telling us to lay off or to change our tactics we have lots of leftist groups who do a lot for the community here despite our lesser numbers we plaster the streets with propaganda we hold tons of meetings we rally against injustice and often achieve results by doing so we do our best to rally the working class and this is reflected in our close ties to unions we also oppose the fascists in the streets whenever we need to considering our numbers what we achieve is miraculous the media is behind the fascists the petit bourgeois of australia have a fuckyougotmine attitude and are behind the fascists there are a ton of political parties with views that overlap with the fascists the simple fact is that society outside of the working classes is welcoming fascism back into the fold with open and caring arms and this is inevitably influencing the majority were outnumbered and outgunned the chance that this can be remedied with peaceful resistance at least in the australian context is pretty much we can only work to slow the spread and our numbers mandate insurrection as our only option
socialism,not_removed,i grew up in a small town with an active kkk thankfully not anymore but it was still around when i left i think a lot of people who casually dismiss the threat that fascists pose and the need for antifa just really do not understand the psychological effect it has on you to be afraid to walk by yourself anywhere to have your black and latina friends from other cities not want to come visit because of your towns reputation to move into a neighborhood where there was a burning cross as recently as where they chase out a lebanese family for being terrorists some of them and far less than youd think may be working class but mostly they just terrorize the working class they need to be stopped and i support antifa
socialism,not_removed,i think its very positive that comrades want to stop the threat of fascism but i dont think antifas tactics are the best way to do it people are attracted to fascist ideas because of legitimate problems with the system and the lack of a left alternative being posed therefore our response to fascists should be to mobilise the largest number of ordinary people possible and put class politics front and centre its correct to physically block them from rallying but we should do it in a collective united way via picket lines and occupying the space through superior numbers instead i see a lot of antifa members getting into individual punchons with nazis this is ultimately counterproductive because it makes it easier for the mainstream media to present it as just two groups of extremists and gives the government the justification it needs to introduce antiprotest laws this is happening in melbourne right now after several recent rallies against the farright that devolved into fistfighting
socialism,not_removed,p good i hate fascists as much as the next comrade
socialism,not_removed,good fascism must be crushed
socialism,not_removed,antifascism as a political ideology is essentially a defense of liberal democracy that can be worthwhile in certain contextsobviously such as when there is the impending threat of fascism but its important not to draw illusions in antifa as anything but a selfdefense measure it isnt a vehicle for social change and is therefore genuinely incapable of defeating fascism i think theres also a tendency for antifa to be exclusionary towards ordinary working people and what i mean by this is that more often than not antifa goes to a fascist demo looking to get into a punch up as opposed to taking part in area denial and simply rejecting fascists their platform and defending that rejection by force if necessary not as a first resort the eager nature with which antifa initiates violence on any given protest along with the attire that these people wearlike yeah youre really going to gain mass appeal dressed in all black and covering your face is extremely intimidating granted i cover my face at any antifa protests but not in the manner the black bloc types do clearly as it escalates such as with golden dawn in greece there is a necessity to take far more aggressive and violent actionsuch as arming yourself to whatever degree is necessary when confrontations with fascists occur but again doing so should primarily be in defense of the movements of the working class and of vulnerable communities that the fascists are targeting to continue with the example of golden dawn the nazis in greece are armed with weapons knives guns etc its appropriate then that in the interests of selfdefense that working class and antifa organisations arm themselves as well all in all i wont speak negatively about them because theyre out there trying to do something but i will present tactical criticisms where i think its appropriate
socialism,not_removed,i dont understand why anyone would consider beating fascists a bad thing
socialism,not_removed,the best antifascist strategy and tactic is workers power see how they shit their pants after that
socialism,not_removed,great they beat the shit out of fascists whats not to like
socialism,not_removed,it is very good but will say that my only comradely criticism is that antifa should turn into the peoples army which will make it ultragood we need to absolutely crush these disgusting fascist subhuman insects like the worthless vermin they are into the fucking ground edit btw fuck liberal free speech shit no political rights of any sort for any fascists or any enemies of the people
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,bad because they wont callwrite me back all i want is to meet fellow comrades and participate in gatherings what gives
socialism,not_removed,who exactly do you think we are
socialism,not_removed,in a weird way i think it might be more effective to let the fascist idiots sit at their rallies and do nothing but be bored most of them are violent thugs so fighting them makes them feel strong and influential
socialism,not_removed,personally id rather convince someone who believes in fascism that fascism is bad than hit them on the head with a baseball bat but to each his own
socialism,not_removed,good fascists do deserve freedom of speech but what happens after they give their message is to be discussed
socialism,not_removed,i would like to warn you comrades about those fascists are trying to discredit the antifa mpvement
socialism,not_removed,neutral but very counter productive im concerned with the working class first and were always directed towards just beating on ourselves by our leadership first most of the proclaimed fascists are confused working class people and not actual fascists now keep in mind im not referring to europe which does have real fascists meaning antifa against the real neonazis that took over keiv we just dont have the material organization or even a strategy that leads us forward but if we did at least you found the correct target real fascists meet with john mccain to pickup weapons and overthrow a fairly corrupt government with an even more corrupt government that is worse than one they overthrew antifa against trumpbrexit supporters working class reactionaries on the streets no no no a thousand times no we need them to hear marx but with our horrible leadership on the eu now they trust us even less simply put we need to tell the liberals to fck themselves and stand with the working class even when the result is very minimal we need to be willing to oppose neoliberalists first their selfserving identity politics and their beloved institutions even though we dont love the reactionary alternative then we will finally have their ears and we can be seen as trust worthy by the very reactionaries we must lead towards marxism we must never advocate for things outside of the material as in pretending a social europe ever existed or will exist when our class didnt create it in addition dont let the ameterial and liberal arguments convince you this wasnt better for our class the transnational capitalist class is already talking about how the next war isnt looking as likely now they spun that like youd expect but they definitely seemed slightly bummed if we dont do this we will never be anything
socialism,not_removed,vets were the real fascists for violating their frozen peaches they should of sat down and discussed things with hitler fascism was not defeated by shooting them it was defeated by peaceful protest
socialism,not_removed,even by saying its bad you are now a fascist everyone knows the only truly good point of view on any subject is neutral
socialism,not_removed,because some people see it as a way to corral leftist energy into merely attacking a byproduct of capitalism rather than focusing their energies on dismantling the capitalist system that inevitably produces fascism
socialism,not_removed,good point theres more than enough historical precedent in regards to bashing the fash
socialism,not_removed,thanks for putting yourself at risk to fight them we need more comrades like you everywhere and less of the would you like to buy a newspaper crowd
socialism,not_removed,the media is always going to present it as two groups of extremists and the liberal democratic governments usually produce antiprotest laws through the executive and judiciary rather than through our socalled representatives in the legislatures antifa by definition is trying to organize as many people as possible to stop fascists which is why historically it has been one of the few groups where anarchists and communists get along fairly well and i dont even want to know what you meant by ordinary no fascists have ever been stopped by respectability what stops them is cutting off their access to our communities public spaces
socialism,not_removed,i wish more people here would realize this i understand the urgency to quell any and all fascist movements but some of these tactics are just counterproductive people who are on the fence are watching so lets not push them away from us
socialism,not_removed,people are attracted to fascist ideas because of legitimate problems with the system and the lack of a left alternative being posed and they become exposed to these ideas often through these street rallies that antifa opposes your liberalism is nauseating
socialism,not_removed,yes when the allies cruelly attacked nazi germany over their expression of their rights was utterly counterproductive and they should of instead negotiated because they where just frustrated by capitalism s
socialism,not_removed,its correct to physically block them from rallying isnt the right to rally a fundamental right of democracy arent you using advocating fascism by stop people from rallying
socialism,not_removed,why the fuck did you get downvoted seriously
socialism,not_removed,i had a similar runaround way back in the day when i became involved with antiracist action the reason is that theyre never sure who they can trust you could be a police officer or neonazi plant so getting involved in an antifacist group beyond just being told when theyre having a demonstration can be quite difficult
socialism,not_removed,they dont just sit at their rallies they are actively recruiting and
socialism,not_removed,the problem isnt the rally so much as what happens after the rally if theres no reason such as protesters for them to quickly go home thats when they go looking for people to harass
socialism,not_removed,kind of agree especially in places like the us where real fascists are so insignificant both in terms of numbers and in terms of influence the ideology is clearly dangerous fascist movements are clearly dangerous i just dont know how effective some of these antifa demonstrationscounterrallies are id say at least from my experience in the us those leaning towards fascism are people whove really been hurt by neoliberalism and are see this as a solution to some of these problems and i just dont see how typical antifa actions would address this it seems more effective to me to while being clear about the real dangers of fascism think about why people are turning to fascism and address those root causes and build a strong left alternative so working people have something real to turn to as far as weird altrightneoreactionarydark enlightenment what fun names they have techies and the like a la mencius moldbug whatever they even are ideologically definitely has some fascist elements though i dont even know what to think about them not sure about how influential they are ive never met one offline that i know of but they clearly exist in europe and particularly in the uk right now antifa might be more important as we are seeing larger mobilizations of fascists have already seen increasing attacks on immigrants which will probably only get worse
socialism,not_removed,ideas should be spoken if theyre worthwhile irrespective if they have legal sanction
socialism,not_removed,if you cannot convince a fascist acquiant his head with the pavement p
socialism,not_removed,acab bootlicking piece of shit
socialism,not_removed,dont forget cleverly engineered slogans super crucial
socialism,not_removed,the weaker the fascists are now the weaker theyll be in the revolution gotta save some energy for organization and theory
socialism,not_removed,i know youre just the messenger but i really do hate that sort of absolutism we can fight the radical and violent fringes that capitalism creates while also seeking to dismantle capitalism itself showing up to resist fascism doesnt mean that we dont also put energy into grassroots organizing and agitating against the capitalist system
socialism,not_removed,one can do both
socialism,not_removed,i see it more as stopping the worst rot from spreading yes the whole system is broken yes fascism is a byproduct of people who dont know better to show their dissatisfaction but that doesnt mean its not necessary to stop those who want to change it for the worse by blaming scapegoats
socialism,not_removed,please tell me this is a joke antifa is the real fascist is like a poor liberal joke
socialism,not_removed,im a bit of a newbie can someone tell me if the above is whats known as brocialism
socialism,not_removed,i think one can also look at the wealth of american history and see reason to be afraid of racism do you think minority members of the working class who do have to deal with not only that but also racism exist why are those lashing out the focus instead of their victims if theyre being exploited and victimized how does this not further apply to the people they victimize
socialism,not_removed,id just like to ask do you think racism is at all a problem
socialism,not_removed,the media will always try to present it like that but we make their job easier when there are plenty of working class people watching this sort of thing happen on tv at home people whove never been involved in politics before who are understandably intimated by and the violence we need to actively appeal to these people to join us and build a mass movement that says no to racism cuts and austerity im not at all saying we shouldnt physically stop the farright from organising in our community spaces we should do that but we have to do it in a united collective way that offers a political alternative kicking a local nazi in the head isnt going to fill the political vacuum that is giving these fascists air we have to put forward slogans aimed at uniting the mass of workers by pointing out the class interests behind mainstream politics banners placards chants from what ive seen of antifa in melbourne little to no effort is made to do this
socialism,not_removed,oh fuck off last year the socialist party organised the first major rally against reclaim australia last year the april one at federation square and we successfully physically stopped the majority of the racists from getting to their rally and mobilised over people the success of that rally shifted the whole mainstream debate around racism and caused a split in the ranks of reclaim australia trying to beat the farright by engaging in individual punchons isnt more radical its macho and juvenile and it damages the movement by making it harder to mobilise the rest of the population
socialism,not_removed,vets were the real fascists for violating their free speech fascism was defeated with peaceful protest
socialism,not_removed,today the allied forces committed an act of violent aggression when they landed on the beaches of normandy and suppressed the free expression of the wehrmacht forces sarcasm aside no the mistake liberals constantly make is that fascism is anything that isnt liberalism which is nonsense by this metric literally every state on the planet is fascist because all states on the planet restrict freedoms to a certain degree
socialism,not_removed,the right to rally is fundamental as written about by socialists like rosa luxemburg but she was talking about fostering a political discourse among the proletariat and preventing bureaucracy from becoming entrenched the fascists do not come out to engage in political discourse for the betterment of the people they come out to be violent and to promote violence
socialism,not_removed,i am not surprised that i am being downvotedor was apparently most of the left think it is wrong for revolutionaries to go to war against reactionaries even though reactionaries are doing this against us no wonder alot of the left sucks and just knows mostly defeat and irrelevancy
socialism,not_removed,oh i fully support defending people who are attacked i meant more in terms of looking for trouble like going to fascist rallies and getting in their faces i understand the sentiment of this i just feel like it inflates their ego when they should feel as worthless as they are
socialism,not_removed,deleted
socialism,not_removed,pretty much every active antifa person i know does other organizing whereas their critics are usually just internet activists
socialism,not_removed,its a stunning defense of racism and the ku klux klan is what it is
socialism,not_removed,hah look through his history he says hes going to vote for trump
socialism,not_removed,just fascism
socialism,not_removed,hate to break it to you but socialism isnt respectable in the bourgeois superstructure
socialism,not_removed,i dont know about melbourne but where im from the working class isnt impressed by banners and chants or cleverly engineered slogans but by what you do for them antifa has historically been a movement led by and for the working class from by any means necessary in oakland who are actively involved in several political struggles to sharp skin heads against racial prejudice in the uk most importantly immigrant youth in the us have played a huge rule in antifa the immigrant day laborers arent just the working class but the proletariat of the world im all for the white working class joining in but when the nazis have made the move to occupy a public space there needs to be disciplined swift action to remove them by any means necessary at all other times i have and will continue to fight for a better life for the white working class and steer them away nonviolently
socialism,not_removed,the black bloc masks do stink of poor imagery its very easy to spin that the people in all black and face masks are the bad guys to those uninformed
socialism,not_removed,antifa arent engaging in random one on one punchons so your rhetorics falling through the mud pretty rapidly there have you interacted with them really sounds like youre being swayed by the media narrative that depicts them as such youre also trying to imply that the fascists are losing in victoria which is just wrong were outnumbered pretty close to overall the only reason the numbers tend to be more even on the streets is because the brunt of their militant membership is rural while ours is urban they come in on multihour bus rides while we drive minutes the sympathies of the media lie with them and did long before they shifted the rhetoric to critique of antifa the sympathies outside of the working class lie with them they are far more active in recruiting online etc all of this is resulting in far more proletariat falling in with their message than with ours i always cringe when i see leftist groups proclaim complete and total victory over the fascists at their protests yes you did a great job opposing them but we arent winning not even close spreading a message of victory is spreading a message of false security regardless of all of this bashing even an individual fascist is a completely fine and commendable action regardless of the circumstance
socialism,not_removed,damn thats sad
socialism,not_removed,nah most of us just know that the current political situation in most countries with active fascists presences are nothing at all like maos long march
socialism,not_removed,again if counter protesters dont show up it wont make them feel worthless it will make them feel like theyre making inroads into the public the kkk used to have a march every year in my home town and the local chapter only disbanded after counter protesters started showing up and getting in their faces
socialism,not_removed,fascism is inherently violent and looks to stir trouble antifa should always be there to defend the innocent
socialism,not_removed,saying that everyone should avoid fascist rallies just gives them control of the streets what about the people who need to go shopping the people who dont keep an eye on what rallys there are the people just minding their own buisness who defends them also if nobody puts up a fight then they know theyve won
socialism,not_removed,would you really judge someone purely on their use of emojis
socialism,not_removed,wow its like a liberal bingo
socialism,not_removed,not being the biggest doesnt necessarily mean a concern that can be sidelined redrosa wasnt talking about ceos and again the minorities hit by these lashing outs are also working class and that shit builds up when people sideline that as a handwavable issue and then simultaneously cajole your attackers as if theyre the true victims here does nothing to perpetuate the idea that the racist aspect of society would change at all
socialism,not_removed,for the working class african american their biggest concern is being working class who pray tell told you africanamericans or any other people of color arent concerned about racism and i question your opposition to racism when you frame it as mere inconvenience for executives and not something that affects working class people of color marxists dont use multiclass individuals as analysis points in other words marxists are unconcerned with any oppression beyond class oppression then of course going with occams razor youre just a fascist defending fascists since in your world the klan are the victims and the targets of their racism are just neoliberals
socialism,not_removed,antifa arent engaging in random one on one punchons so your rhetorics falling through the mud pretty rapidly there have you interacted with them really sounds like youre being swayed by the media narrative that depicts them as such ive seen with my own eyes antifa members break ranks from picket lines to chase and fight nazis this is what i mean i know very well how the media likes to portray events but i also know that antifas undisciplined macho approach has been one of the factors leading to the decline of the antiracist movement in melbourne over the past year have you noticed that recent rallies have generally been smaller and more chaotic compared to early last year why do you think this is youre also trying to imply that the fascists are losing in victoria which is just wrong thats not what im implying im implying that the type of mass action we had on april last year was far more effective than the recent scuffles at coburg or in the cbd regardless of all of this bashing even an individual fascist is a completely fine and commendable action regardless of the circumstance my problem is not that some rightwing nutters are getting bashed my problem is that publicly doing that at a rally is counterproductive to building a mass anticapitalist antiracist movement did you read the article i linked in my first comment let me pull some quotes from it the problem with small scale and individual actions in isolation is three fold firstly there is the risk that you can help to create sympathy for the enemy for example the media have previously played up the idea that ordinary mums and dads have been attacked for attending reclaim australia rallies while they will always be biased in their reporting our goal should be to not play into the hands of the capitalist press we should try to make it difficult for them to spin a narrative that favours the far right in any way secondly small group or individual actions send the wrong message to people who are not yet involved in our movement we want to encourage the biggest number of people possible to attend our actions we want to convince working people that their agency matters this will put us in a much stronger position to both combat far right groups but to also win the demands that can cut across the basis for racist ideas disciplined collective actions such as blockades and pickets where people are linking arms are not only effective but send an important message to onlookers small group and individual actions not only take resources away from more effective mobilisations but can send the message that people do not have to mobilise themselves instead they give the impression that other people are doing the work for you when building social movements the message you send to potential participants is important this is also the reason why socialists do not wear masks at political actions we want to build connections and trust with working class people and that is not usually facilitated by wearing a mask and hiding your identity thirdly small group combat in isolation can sometimes give the state the excuse it is looking for to introduce further repressive measures and crack down on protest activity for example in the aftermath of the protests in melbourne dozens of activists were charged with riot and affray and tied up in court proceedings this consumed them for months on end and many ended up demoralised and drifted away from political activity – a result that the state is no doubt very happy with moves towards introducing new repressive laws were made almost as soon as the footage of the scuffles at coburg was screened while there is no doubt that the state would like to introduce a whole suite of new laws to curtail our right to protest they need political justification to carry it out our goal should be to make this as difficult as possible for them the less restriction people have on their ability to organise the better placed they will be to win gains im not sure if you understand that in order to win people away from farright racist ideas its essential that we build a real leftwing political alternative we cant do that on the basis of the type of intervention that i routinely see antifa engage in
socialism,not_removed,nobody is saying nothing has to be like anything anywhere so dont sit there and foolishly mistake me for some fucking dogmatist all i am saying is that as long classes are in struggle each class has andor needs some sort of military apparatus war is an extension of politics and vice versa etc is is it primary no politics always primary is over militarism the bourgeoisie has one and the fascists will damn sure build one where is the peoples military apparatus
socialism,not_removed,im not sure if you understand that in order to win people away from farright racist ideas its essential that we build a real leftwing political alternative i completely agree but this isnt being stunted in any way shape or form by antifa they are small their actions are isolated and before the media focus was on them we were still fledgling its our own complete failure to rally behind a simple message that resonates with people socialist groups in australia have a very counterproductive tendency to cater purely towards people who already have socialist leanings
socialism,not_removed,i dont think youre going to find a single book encompassing all volumes of capital because it is a massive series encompassing thousands and thousands of pages vol of penguins version is pages alone if youre looking for a decent sampling of various works of marx then check out which also includes the manifesto
socialism,not_removed,they have capital vol and the manifesto at the barnes and noble near me lmao you can probably buy that ish online too also if youre near the philly area the wooden shoe is a sick radical book store with a lot of great books and zines
socialism,not_removed,thriftbooks
socialism,not_removed,it depends on where you live but its relatively common for bookstores to have the communist manifesto the capital isnt good for a beginner unless you have a good background on economics or at least essays since its both long and dense you may also ask in bookstores for contemporary anticapitalist authors who dedicate some good effort to divulgation such as chomsky and zizek
socialism,not_removed,amazon has a lot for cheap
socialism,not_removed,i got a book from a yard sale called the marxengels reader and it has a huge amount of their works compiled
socialism,not_removed,imo the carbon tax initiative in wa is a big mixed bag and i can see reasons for voting for it and against it however when big corporations republicans and billionaireowned newspapers are using it to attack the left that rings huge alarm bells for me its deeply disturbing to hear them using the language of sensible climate policy as an attack on the left you know they dont give a shit about actual sensible climate policy so what are they trying to accomplish you know what real sensible climate policy is complete decarbonization of the economy by the end of the nationalization of all energy companies through quantitative easing followed by the immediate and rapid draw down of operations in accordance with deg c pathway scenarios recommended by the paris climate agreement a ban on fracking a ban on all new major fossil fuels infrastructure keeping all fossil fuels in the ground but you wont hear any of this from the wapo
socialism,not_removed,careful with that rhetoric or youll be on the receiving end of a minute long john oliver schtick s
socialism,not_removed,i for one think httpsenwikipediaorgwikisyriana is underrated given the underlying geopolitical messages and themes in it one of the plotlines follows the plight of a couple migrant workers in the middle east to show how people can be radicalized and turned towards terrorismthus allowing viewers to understand that people dont attack the west just because western values the movie also explores the power capitalists hold as a reformist prince and future king is killed by a drone strike since his policies of nationalization would endanger american oil interests this is not to forget the fantastic manner in which all the plots are interwoven to gather the complexity of whats currently going on in the middle east i couldve given a better background for the movie but i was kind of hoping somebody else wouldve seen it e wording
socialism,not_removed,great movie when i saw it its been a few years but i hope its held up
socialism,not_removed,nice movie only thing i didnt like was that the progressive sonpossible heir was just promoting liberalism
socialism,not_removed,lolwut xd well i mean it does involve shrek overthrowing a monarchy in order to liberate the people under the monarchy for them to live under no rule so i suppose it seems to be more of a generic anarchist film than anything xd
socialism,not_removed,hmmmmmm ill leave this link open rewatch shrek with socialist analysis in mind and then read this
socialism,not_removed,he also pretends to be a union representative and convinces the worker to let him in to the potion factory
socialism,not_removed,its been at least years since ive seen the movie i need to rewatch it tomorrow xd i was too tired today
socialism,not_removed,what i dont understand is how they justify charging the customer more for the delivery fee than they pay me if you did not produce more for company than you are paid they would not hire you the point of a business is to reimburse sharestakeholders if you arent part owner of the business then youre a tool you are a gear a hammer a lever to them and nothing more it doesnt really require analysis the justification is that theyre in business to make money they only pay you at all because they have to
socialism,not_removed,aside from the obvious exploitation of selling your labor time pizza hut in my town pulls the same shit there is a delivery fee which goes to the store and not the driver i cant remember if they announce it anywhere to the customer that it is not a tip that goes to the driver the reimbursement for each delivery is really good compared to what i used to get absolutely nothing when i delivered pizza years ago
socialism,not_removed,so putting in to pay me for a delivery and getting back is like a return on investment okay that makes sense id love it if the employees bought the company but honestly its hispanics with poor english who work in the kitchen and lazy guys in their who work the counter floor and deliveries there would be a lot of empowerment required to get these people to be up to running the place its sad its like weve been conditioned to be apathetic about the store i suppose thats alienation
socialism,not_removed,so putting in to pay me for a delivery and getting back is like a return on investment okay that makes sense thats employment in a nutshell id love it if the employees bought the company but honestly its hispanics with poor english who work in the kitchen and lazy guys in their who work the counter floor and deliveries there would be a lot of empowerment required to get these people to be up to running the place its sad its like weve been conditioned to be apathetic about the store i suppose thats alienation as i recall marx makes the point that craftsmen long ago did the work decided how the money was spent set their own hours and in all ways had a very personal relationship with their work and the communityconsumership around them the rise of industrial capitalism saw rapid accumulation of capital and thus a rapid increase of employment the craftsmen went out of business or were put out of business httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinclosureacts and selling ones labor power employment became the dominant method of earning a living in such a situation someone else makes all the rules distributes the revenue decides when and how the work is done and in all ways divorces the laborer from the fruits of their labor and into the role of a machine expected to come do the job on the boss terms and leave with minimal fuss for the laborer the personal relationship that comes from having power in their economic life no longer exists they are alienated from their work with all the unhappinesses inherent in that position
socialism,not_removed,you may have a few misconceptions about what socialism is first of all while most of the time socialists strive to be as egalitarian as possible this does not mean that everyone is forced to be the exact same as everyone else we do not want some kind of harrison bergeron style distopia additionally you seem to try to define socialism as a political system while it is primarily an economic one the definition of socialism which a google search could tell you is a society in which the means of production are owned socially the auto mod has some recommendations for introductory readings on socialism and i encourage you to check out as well while you dont seem to know exactly what socialism is i will get back to your original question many socialists believe that socialism cannot work at anything but a global scale and many disavow the use of the state to implement socialism believing it to be an inherently oppressive means of social organization however i dont think a socialist society would have almost any problem with elected representatives to fulfill certain roles provided they were elected democratically thank you for your interest and if you have any more questions feel free to ask
socialism,not_removed,thx for your reply i will check out that sub and come back later probably with a lot more questions
socialism,not_removed,to further elaborate on the previous posters spoton reply socialists generally do not oppose representative decisionmaking that is genuinely representative—which is to say that delegates elected by some organization or assembly relate the interests of the body they represent precisely and only after consulting with them think a union locals delegation to a general conference under this set of standards delegates would be instantly recallable and it would be taken for granted that any resolution passed with the approval of a delegate who is subsequently recalled be nullified until more adequate representation has had the chance to voice the affected communitys real interests bourgeois democratic forms provide for no assurances of accountability and in fact incentivize collusion between elite interests and representatives against the latters constituents this is the basis of the socialist critique of liberal democracy—that it is anything but democratic
socialism,not_removed,by the way uimplodingtwinkies meant to link you to the one they linked is private
socialism,not_removed,how is this even seen as remotely acceptable this is what the medical industry has become in the united states its complicated confusing and expensive in time effort and money
socialism,not_removed,i know its probably a perfectly fine article but i honestly cant bring myself to click the link because of the clickbaity wording of the title it should have just been theres a cheaper alternative to the epipen the rest can be clarified inside the article
socialism,not_removed,yes the article title sucks but i left it because nothing more could ever be a better commentary on the situation than this i was tempted to change the title because it urked me too but on the otherhand this is what capitalism does sad to say this is the kind of journalism standards one of the most viewed science publication has whats sad even old media is starting to use this tactic ive seen several respected news organizations use clickbaiting more often to get views
socialism,not_removed,i think that we have inflated our collective ego as a racehuman race because of advances in technology are these inflations justified perhaps the unimaginable is now possible yet there are many who argue that because of these advancements inequality has emerged ultimately it boils down to how you view history and the evolution of society if one views it as just a ever progressing treeas in video games then technology is all about achieving the next power level however i believe this is a very narrow view on progression and maybe the way the human race has developed isnt the optimum way a society should develop what did i just type
socialism,not_removed,our race believed it was superior five thousand years ago i doubt it was very different before that
socialism,not_removed,i mean whether or not someone needs to feel like humans are superior creatures were certainly unique creatures we won the evolutionary lottery by being a bipedal landbased fast reproducing animal with large complex brains allowing for advanced sentience i feel like this gives us a responsibility to the vast number of lifeforms that havent developed what we have
socialism,not_removed,im honestly impressed that we could organize enough comrades in alabama for a rally at all excellent work
socialism,not_removed,i was there i tell ya comrades i didnt think this rally was going to happen we already had to reschedule from our original date due to rain i got there about an hour before the rally was starting and we had a few people trickle in as it got closer to the starting time then out of nowhere a huge storm blew in and drenched everything there were some jokes made about god supporting fascists but we all knew it was a bust the cool thing was that even in the rain people would still trickle in it eventually stopped after about minutes and in typical mobile fashion quickly turned our protest into a tropical humid oven but we pressed on in total we probably had about comrades and allies show up great speeches were given regarding the struggles of lgbtq and black workers under capitalism and who were targeted by a kkk leaflet campaign we then had a march around downtown mobile we didnt have any issues with reactionaries there were a few real redneck looking dudes sitting in an suv watching us and occasionally coming close enough to hear what we were talking about overall even through the weather it was a success like it said in the article our rally inspired groups in mississippi to hold their own rally solidarity
socialism,not_removed,oh hi we are reddit famous lol
socialism,not_removed,ura
socialism,not_removed,weve gotten people marching in that same park comrade that was when trayvon was shot alabama is a hotbed of radical politics when you realize that there are more than conservative white men here 😉
socialism,not_removed,awesome work comrade solidarity
socialism,not_removed,may be moving to the mobile area here shortlyabout mins away in mississippi would love to meet up with some like minded comrades when i do
socialism,not_removed,if you have a facebook pm me and ill invite you to our allies page
socialism,not_removed,its disgusting what happened hopefully the people that are seeing this so many americans get their news from shit like foxcnn msnbc and they wont are connecting it to the ongoing colonialism and capitalism
socialism,not_removed,the depressing thing is its accurate
socialism,not_removed,its funny since the pipeline protests are much less violent hell they are peaceful protests unlike the bundy standoff where people died and were injured also dont forget that people at the standoff went and
socialism,not_removed,i still cant believe mainstream news isnt talking about this thank god for democracy now or i would be totally in the dark
socialism,not_removed,deleted
socialism,not_removed,of course people are seeing this but they dont give a shit this is america the overwhelming majority of our population are savages at best so long as they personally can enjoy their lives they have no incentive to dopressure anythinganyone capitalism essentially breeds that into people
socialism,not_removed,your link is to a different incident i think youre thinking of a different event edit as far as i can tell from reading about it the only person killed was one of the militants who was killed in a traffic stop where the leaders of the protest were arrested on their way to a meeting somewhere
socialism,not_removed,which just goes to prove that a peaceful protest is absolute bullshit
socialism,not_removed,a while back a bunch of white antigovenment militamen took over a nature preserve in an armed standoff they were led by the son of another famous militaman who has led armed standoffs against the government trying to defend illegal grazing there is a lot of publicgovt owned land in the western united states but for a pittance one can often log or graze there this week the militiamen who staged an armed siege on a ranger station were all released due to jury nullification which is the process by which the jury when presented with all the evidence decide to not press charges this contrasts with the native american protesters of the dakota access pipeline who have been protesting on private land but it is misappropriated tribal land they have been attacked by illegally handled dogsobviously owning an attack dog is a highly trained position numerous journalists have been arrested and many arrests have been made its partly the dichotomy between armed and unarmed protesters but there is a strong racial element as well as the fact that the extreme right wing armed militia has been let off scotfree while the nonwhite left of hitler environmentalist protesters have been brutalized
socialism,not_removed,we live in a culture that glorifies greed and justifies sloth all the while demonizing folks who need a hand so little to no charity is actually done unfortunately most of us who feel the need to help arent in much of a position to help i suppose you dont typically want to topple the power structures that be if youre part of them i hate our backwardsass moral system
socialism,not_removed,person died at bundy read the whole wikipedia article the police shootings were conducted by people at the standoff that left and went to las vegas inspired by the antigovernment standoff they started shooting policemen
socialism,not_removed,some additional context the bundy protestors proposed using human fucking shields to defend their right to graze cows for free while these people havent hurt a fucking fly
socialism,not_removed,what incentive is there for the capitalist hegemony to keep this guy out of jail
socialism,not_removed,the protesters are also trespassing i saw a few videos where they were given multiple warnings to back up but they went forward instead
socialism,not_removed,deleted
socialism,not_removed,left of hitler
socialism,not_removed,except for the cattle and horses and bison they shot killed and stole from ranchers im in nd i work around standing rock and there is a lot of violence going on that isnt being reported
socialism,not_removed,not every injustice comes directly on order from the capitalists
socialism,not_removed,they dont get to remain the hegemony if they piss off everyone
socialism,not_removed,for the minor injustice of trespassing you should be attacked by dogs therefore for the major injustice of attacking peaceful protesters with dogs you should be
socialism,not_removed,the bundies organized an armed take over of federal land and explicitly threatened to kill anyone who tried to take it back so if trespassing merits dogs the bundies should have been what nuked
socialism,not_removed,who the flying fuck cares
socialism,not_removed,as in running the whole gamut from farleft to actually kind of on the right but not all the way into nazi territory
socialism,not_removed,as in nearly everyone
socialism,not_removed,are there any local news reports or articles you can link too first ive heard of the protesters shooting cattle im a bit skeptical
socialism,not_removed,jury nullification the specific charge was that they conspired to prevent federal workers from doing their jobs and members of the jury have said they simply did not believe the prosecution did enough to prove it for instance the park was closed for the winter so they literally were not preventing anyone from working since no one was supposed to be there those idiots did not get much sympathy around the state during the occupation and oregon has a lot of rednecks so i find claims of racial bias to be dubious at best its still pretty appalling i have friends who work in the justice department as well as for blm here in oregon and everyone is going nuts over the verdict those prosecutors screwed the pooch
socialism,not_removed,they were acquitted through jury nullification do you have any proof of this or is it speculation
socialism,not_removed,definately not saying the bundies were in the right either they deserved to be arrested or whatever im just saying two different things
socialism,not_removed,httpwwwtslncomnewsstolenbutcheredlivestockneardakotapipelineprotestsite during an interveiw with the sheriff of morton county on am he mentioned that in the case where cattle were stolen a private property that was next to the protest area had its fence fut and there were vehicle tracks from protest area into the private property were the cattle were stolen i cant link that because im form nd and thats a station i listen to when im out and about so i dont remember the exact day of the interview im not saying the standing rock people dont have legitimate concern but the reporting on this has been very one sided during this last set of arrests a woman tried to shoot police and moltovs were thrown at them but even though that happened no protesters died and none of them were seriously injured the majority of arrests have been out of state protesters this protest has been going on for days now and its just now getting major media coverage
socialism,not_removed,those prosecutors screwed the pooch hmmm why does that sound familiar how come prosecution suddenly goes inept when police kills some guy or a guntoting rightwinger gets arrested but like half the people they send to death row end up being acquitted theres little justice in the justice system
socialism,not_removed,but they dont care about the cows they care about them as property and destroying property is violence fuck these assholes
socialism,not_removed,are you some kind of vegan extremist that believes no cattle should be slaughtered
socialism,not_removed,thank you for posting some info
socialism,not_removed,i dont think that not believing cattle should be slaughtered is an extremist vegan idea edit did i just get wooshed
socialism,not_removed,no my question was genuine i know many vegans including my sisterinlaw and they are vegan for health not moral reasons i dont think ive met a moral vegan in person before it does seem to be an extreme minority of vegans
socialism,not_removed,im not even vegi but i have a moral and ecological argument against mass farming i guess it depends i would say most vegans are but its pointless being overtly vocal about it as it just posses people off
socialism,not_removed,a few vegans i know say health to avoid arguments
socialism,not_removed,being a vegan isnt more healthy than bring an omnivore where would you get that idea when i became vegetarian i actually gained a tonne of weight the cooking style is very different and it takes time to get it right
socialism,not_removed,i dont believe that vegans i know do
socialism,not_removed,hmmm fair enough do you have some sources id like to read this because having been a vegetarian for many years this is not at all my experience of things its significantly harder to maintain a balanced nutrient rich diet here in the uk its made considerably easier by certain meat replacement products such as the mycoprotein based quorn but still requires a lot of work
socialism,not_removed,be wary the communists in germany predicted a groundswell too after hitler its our turn they were the first to get gassed socialism is not governed by determinism it is governed by action agitation solidarity and education if we rely upon the rise of the far right as a presupposition for the rise of socialism and as a means in itself our movement is destined for failure history is not a wheel it doesnt move of its own volition history is a plough it is only moved by pressing shoulder to the yoke
socialism,not_removed,good shit imo
socialism,not_removed,far left for the koch brothers is joe freaking biden
socialism,not_removed,if you go to r politics for your sanity dont you see the majority of people actually now thinking the koch brothers are on the good side because they oppose trump its disturbing how easily people are manipulated
socialism,not_removed,let them tremble
socialism,not_removed,when ever im reading this question from americans whether reading the communist manifesto is sufficient to be a leftist i know america doesnt need koch brothers americans are koch brothers in their minds
socialism,not_removed,comrade jeb and rogue forest rangers will lead the american peoples resistance army
socialism,not_removed,one can only hope change in america causes change in the world
socialism,not_removed,damn skippy
socialism,not_removed,yes please
socialism,not_removed,for sure the pendulum will swing
socialism,not_removed,from their lips to gods ears
socialism,not_removed,i used to correspond with an old communist who was a retired faculty member at my university when he was a new professor probably or early he did a study on the lives of the new england elite like the big time capitalist families in the north east he ended up building relationships with several prominent men and was often invited to their summer homes to collect research and interviews i dont remember much of the details but this old guy vividly remembers walking into one of their private libraries and being astonished to find volumes and volumes of marxist literature he asks why on earth would a man of your status be reading these and the billionaire replied because i must know my enemy that story has always left an impression on me i do believe that billionaires like the koch brothers view the world through a vaguely marxist lens the difference is that they see it from the other side
socialism,not_removed,trump is providing the conditions for the koch brothers prediction to come to fruition but itll come to naught if were not conscious to seize the opportunity
socialism,not_removed,they shouldnt worry though if history tells us anything its that the liberals and demsocs will betray the movement at the first concessions of the ruling class and claim victory so they can keep their shitty economic system
socialism,not_removed,get that thing i sent you
socialism,not_removed,lol or that starbucks is the resistance because they announced they will hire refugees exploit refugee workers
socialism,not_removed,i havent seen that the most overwhelmingly common response is something like holy crap i agree with the kochs on something the world has gone mad which is very different from i like the kochs now
socialism,not_removed,the majority of people actually now thinking the koch brothers are on the good side that is a gross misrepresentation of most of the thread it seemed like people were surprised that the koch brothers are not pure evil because they like most humans have a varied set of beliefs and are not with the farright on everything in my opinion their views always come down to whatever creates wealth for themselves so i am not inclined to feel positive vibes towards them but if the koch brothers can convince some of the rightofcenter people that some leftofcenter policies could work fine
socialism,not_removed,uphold maoismjebism
socialism,not_removed,without doxxing yourself is there any more info on his study
socialism,not_removed,but will that work this time a lot of interrelated trends are coalescing at this point in history capitalisms general decline automation the widespread use of the internet the distrust of traditional media institutions etc all these are shutting off the usual easy ways out for the ruling class
socialism,not_removed,never change joebot
socialism,not_removed,its very obvious that politics has a liberal bias but i definitely agree most of the people there are pretty anti ruling class bordering on leftist ideas
socialism,not_removed,no
socialism,not_removed,ordinary apolitical people are starting to question whether capitalism can do anything to stop climate change
socialism,not_removed,ah thanks for enlightening me
socialism,not_removed,and pollution of the ground is directly affecting peoples drinking water i think its important to focus on subjects people can directly relate to
socialism,not_removed,you got a no response because leftofcenter policies arent what socialists want thats just curbing capitalism so they can keep it alive longer you can check out for more on this issue
socialism,not_removed,i get that that isnt what socialists want but saying that the majority of people actually now the koch brothers are on the good side is hyperbolic and inaccurate i was pointing that out but if the koch brothers can convince some of the rightofcenter people that some leftofcenter policies could work fine if that is what he was responding to then im not sure what to say fine is a resignation not approval socialism isnt just going to happen in the us without gaining traction among people who are currently living under capitalism people on the left are probably more inclined to swing socialist than people on the right responding with a simple no suggests approach is moral absolutism which is a great way to get people to dismiss your ideas however much merit they have on their own
socialism,not_removed,fair enough i cant speak for that user people on the left are probably more inclined to swing socialist than people on the right maybe depends lots of working people on the right right now
socialism,not_removed,im from denmark but i would be really interested in a subreddit for european socialists actually partly because this sub being pretty centered around american politics for the most part although not as bad as other subs and secondly i think it would be a very nice change from the typical europeanoriented subs which are either filled with liberals like reurope or fascists like reuropean
socialism,not_removed,when you said austriansrothbard and mises are the first two guys who came to my mind ive been using austrians as a name for propertarians who believe the in austrian school of economics too much
socialism,not_removed,i think a european subreddit might be okay but austrian is way too specific
socialism,not_removed,austrian here i also would like a european sub but at the same time we should probably be careful not to split the user base of rsocialism
socialism,not_removed,im really wondering why we dont already have one if someone wants to make one im totally in
socialism,not_removed,reuropes is a nonliberal and nonfascist sub
socialism,not_removed,thats a good idea i am also a european
socialism,not_removed,it would be an austria specific sub where things that may only be interesting or usefull for austrians are to be posted it would also not completely be centered around only socialist things thats why i had an austrian sub in mind because many things would just not belong here or would be too trivial
socialism,not_removed,same i thought this was like carsonian mutualists or something is a weird austrian econ socialist group they argue that private property goes against free market principles
socialism,not_removed,isnt only austrian a bit too small for reddit i think one for europe in general is better
socialism,not_removed,i believe carson calls it neoproudhonian mutualism as far as i knowits some sort of labor theory of value mixed with austrian economicsbut i am not sure and i dont know enough of either to comment on the theoretical validity of his positions
socialism,not_removed,yeah im also thinking now one for europe would be better
socialism,not_removed,basically they argue that the subjective theory of value and labor theory of value arent mutually exclusive on the basis of smiths formulation of the ltv that your expenditure of labor on x good means i do not have to and the notion that all people necessarily value their laboring time they further argue that in the larger economy a free market will necessarily boil price down to the laborvalue of commodities because its the primary limiting factor if you get rid of natural monopolies and rents on land essentially theyre reformulating marxs critique of classical political economy in austrian terms which is useless imo but still theyre doing it
socialism,not_removed,essentially theyre reformulating marxs critique of classical political economy in austrian terms which is useless imo but still theyre doing it useless if we can criticize capitalism using austrian economicsi dont see why we cant use that critique to get some ancaps to consider socialism
socialism,not_removed,nice can the mods of this sub put a link to reduerope in the sidebar please
socialism,not_removed,well ancaps dont really matter though theres so few of them i myself was an objectivist who went through carsonian mutualism and anarchism to marxism but in terms of resourcestimeenergy it would be a lot better to engaging with apolitical types traditional conservatives liberals and even altright people before austrians the reason we run into them on the internet a lot is because both our movements are on the fringe of angloamerican politics austrian economics is unscientific and only really appeals as an ideology to a certain section of privileged white men and women with internalized misogyny who arent exactly our target demographic
socialism,not_removed,but waitaltright people usually are austrians in my experience and they have some bullshit ahistorical where did the state come from theories theres much overlap with the redpiller reactionaries here on reddit ancappery has been taken over by trumpists and neoreactionaries carson and ancaps like roderick long seem like a dying breed
socialism,not_removed,the alt right is mostly exaustrians hoppe is an outlier they tend to go for weirder economic stuff like nick land and actual fascist economists these days some of them are even calling for a planned economy that serves national interests rather than the weak
socialism,not_removed,wow thats incredibly applicable now considering all of the rhetoric that is being said about give trump a chance
socialism,not_removed,what i dont understand is how come no modern democratic system has implemented any kind of legal repercussions for politicians for lying misleading betraying or not accomplishing the promises they made to the voters to get themselves elected getting into office should entail the signing of a contract that states your goals and promises that you got elected for clauses that failed to be fulfilled without an exceptionally good reason should mean a ban from politics and if your performance was deemed hurtful or incompetent you could even end up on jail if at the end of their term at the new election the voter along with voting the new person in office would also rate the effectiveness of the previous in office and depending on the rating a course of action such as the ban or jail sentence could be determined any corruption or abuse of power should automatically ban them from politics on top of any other legal repercussions this way i think that the incompetent and corrupt would be weeded out of politics really early on leaving only honest and capable politicians that are actively interested in the wellbeing of their whole constituency to further motivate capable individuals to represent their peers any elected position should be highly prestigious and well paid this is the only way i could see democracy live on in any efficient fashion and so long as there are no real palpable repercussions for incompetence then nothing will ever improve
socialism,not_removed,great quote
socialism,not_removed,awesome
socialism,not_removed,emma goldman was brilliant
socialism,not_removed,honestly a great quote
socialism,not_removed,if emma goldman could see the absolute spectacle they are now extremely relevant quote thank you
socialism,not_removed,uphold marxistkaepernickism
socialism,not_removed,liberals gonna liberal doesnt matter the year
socialism,not_removed,no matter how progressive a politician may sound if they are not entirely against capitalism they are upholding it and with it all the oppressive structures inherent in capitalism to say we live in a democracy is just bourgeois propaganda we do not control our workplaces we do not make decisions on the running of the nation we do not declare wars to suggest they will accept or allow or even adhere to regulations that prohibit the proper functioning of their state is silly the purpose is to serve the capitalists not the workers to say a politician is honest what does that mean that they are open about their class allegiance to say they are corrupt surely you mean they did not openly declare whos side they have always been on to further motivate capable individuals to represent their peers any elected position should be highly prestigious and well paid if one is interested in helping their community they will do it without a cash incentive to pay them outrageously high salaries is to turn them into capitalists the money did not come out of nowhere it was earned by workers if you havent already read state and revolution i would reccomend reading it
socialism,not_removed,you may be interested in the anticorruption work of representus a nonpartisan group that works to pass anticorruption ballot measures they just passed one in south dakota and have had success on the municipal and district level across the country
socialism,not_removed,wait are we part of the same lib soc group how many members are in the group you mentioned
socialism,not_removed,this news article might be helpful to anyone confused by this httpsitsgoingdownorgaltrighttrollsposingbostonantifafacebookyoutube
socialism,not_removed,boston antifa is def fake an article was written about it original was banned and then the fake one sprang up
socialism,not_removed,ah we are talking about the same page im fb friends with jason and he is mos def an ancom he is very well read on anarchism judging by his posts on his personal page and i think just likes to make conversation points in that group that is certainly strange that he banned you he doesnt seem like one to ban people very quickly in the group ill go ask him tomorrow yo edit wasnt the topic on if antifas techniques were effective in helping to make people join the socialist cause im not the most active in the group and just wanted to be sure
socialism,not_removed,ah gotcha im sorry that you had a bad interaction with the admin the page always seemed pretty decent ill have to message jason about it
socialism,not_removed,yep this is my only account ive been frequenting this sub for like a year but i didnt make an account until like months ago because i felt like i could contribute to conversations i also dont like signing up for social media sites much
socialism,not_removed,hey can you give some examples of how rsocialism engages in discussions of strategy while im not well read and as a result am always working to read more and more and i dont at all think that reading should be abandoned im always a bit frustrated and aimless when it comes to the lack of strategy and the lack of organizing how many pages do we have to turn before we start doing something
socialism,not_removed,i feel like strategy and current events are talked about a lot more on ranarchism this sub seems to mostly revolve around how bad the democrats are how much worse the republicans are and why we should support some vaguely democratic socialist party usually in a country few of us actually live in
socialism,not_removed,ayup i certainly do
socialism,not_removed,ranarchism also has one of the worst visual designs on reddit
socialism,not_removed,former anarchist here that subreddit actually partially drove me away from anarchism
socialism,not_removed,i have a very lovehate relationship with that sub this one is consistently okay
socialism,not_removed,theres very little discussion of anarchism there to be honest is pretty good though
socialism,not_removed,i dont know why i do i just do might have something to do with this sub introducing me to socialism and the fact that its more active than ranarchism
socialism,not_removed,selfworship of protest porn celebrating every time a leo gets killed whats wrong with that
socialism,not_removed,they banned me not that i like much that comes over this sub but whatever there is still a lot of good info
socialism,not_removed,im not much of a libertarian myself i believe in small localized governments and i dont visit ranarchism but i feel as if ranarchism is unspecific and would attract anarchists both from the left right and edgyteenager sides since its not one particular side i feel as if thered be no real discussion going on and rather itd just be a circlejerk of antiauthority porn or something my guess at least
socialism,not_removed,rfullcommunism is the best leftist sub though i see someone hasnt discovered rcompleteanarchy
socialism,not_removed,im feeling the same way id spearhead a discussion but im still only like a level marxist i think you have to be at least level
socialism,not_removed,the only strategy discussions that happen here is whether or not to vote and whether running in elections on vaguely radical platforms is enough to build class consciousness
socialism,not_removed,but stein is the best weve got s
socialism,not_removed,i need to spend more time on ranarchism
socialism,not_removed,wow thats different
socialism,not_removed,whats wrong with it i quite like it
socialism,not_removed,back when i was subscribed there it felt like of discussion was about who is and isnt a real anarchist yes we know that ancaps arent actual anarchists can we please stop beating that dead horse
socialism,not_removed,i call everything not my brand of leftism tankies its a satire sub you know that right
socialism,not_removed,while i am not a tankie i really appreciate tankie humor
socialism,not_removed,the color red is the shit
socialism,not_removed,i think it was their april fools css that they just never changed back
socialism,not_removed,i like free speech and i am not violent enough for them i am also a white cis male i dont remember really i eneded up posting some kids in the hall skit or something as a reply and that kinda pissed em off
socialism,not_removed,defending the dprk isnt much id say defending the khmr rouge is going too far into edginess
socialism,not_removed,even if i ever stop being an anarchist ill always prefer black to red never been a fan of red
socialism,not_removed,i want blue communism tbh i hate red
socialism,not_removed,honestly i think the concept of post left anarchism has as much to do with anarchism as anarcho capitalism what postleft antiwork and primitivism can fuck off playing word games with the term anarchism drawing it away from selforganized bottom up labor and individualisticnonowner class organization are you just just ignoring that max stirner released his books before bakunin and kropotkin any socialistincluding anarchists worth their salt should be antiwork to some degree im not a socialist because i want to collectively own the workplace im a socialist because i want to abolish firms and therefore workplaces as they exist now the means of production shouldnt be owned by a collective body they should be owned by no one
socialism,not_removed,forgive me if im misunderstanding but isnt anarchism concerned primarily with the freedom of the individual moving away from the wage system seems to me like a step in the direction of freedom also inevitable given that technology is constantly developing so some forms of labour simply wont be needed in the future which would be a welcome development in any sane society its a mark imo of how far western society is from sane that we currently see increased automation as a dilemma rather than a welcome progression freeing more humans to spend more of their short time on earth doing things that actually want to do rather than being coerced by the implicit threat of homelessness and starvation into sacrificing the majority of their life to the wage system sorry if this isnt phrased very well i just came off a night shift wage system ftw
socialism,not_removed,anarchy is a bit too edgy for me tbh dowvote to oblivion
socialism,not_removed,khmer rouge apologism is a banworthy offense on rfullcommunism ive also never met a leftist irl who tried to defend them either
socialism,not_removed,defending the dprk isnt much the dprk doesnt even describe itself as socialist anymore it claims to be based on juche which is basically a kind of fascism or at least a close relative
socialism,not_removed,i remember growing up that my favorite colors were always black then red then blue then green anarchocommunismtranshumanismenvironmentalism anyone
socialism,not_removed,i think most people here associate blue with nato and imperialism but suit yourself
socialism,not_removed,im not a socialist just because i want to collectively own the workplace im a socialist because i want to abolish firms and therefore workplaces as they exist now the hell of capitalism is the firm not the fact that the firm has a boss amadeo bordiga
socialism,not_removed,more anarchoegalitiarian there are some people i liked over there but most of them unsubbed or got banned lol i got very tired of hearing about how my word was shit because of my being a cis white male lots of intolerance for people like me over there i think everyone should have a good life
socialism,not_removed,i generally like anarchists but the young ones can be very edgy at times i love the old guys though they know whats what
socialism,not_removed,tankies generally means a mix between a and c stalin did nothing wrong gulags were amazing khmer rouge dprk whatever
socialism,not_removed,ive divided all leftists into different groups tankies nonanarchists and nonleft communists trasharchists nonegoist anarchists leftcomsegoists actual socialists
socialism,not_removed,if you want to see a tankie sub where they actually defend the dprk you can stop by rcommunism that sub had so much potential but its inundated with maoists and stalinists
socialism,not_removed,it describes itself as socialist just not communist though i agree it is closer to fascism than socialism though it still keeps its leftist trappings
socialism,not_removed,my favourite colours are red gold pink peach and brown so what the fuck is that
socialism,not_removed,we should take it back from them then
socialism,not_removed,thats the quote which started my turn against coops and market socialism
socialism,not_removed,the young ones are half the reason i dont identify as an anarchist i mean im not one in the first place and i want to get somewhat close to it but i dont like perfect anarchism and think its too unstable but yeah the old guys are a lot more sensible
socialism,not_removed,you just chose a though
socialism,not_removed,ill defend the ussrs achievements and condemn and also explain their wrongdoings does that make me a tankie
socialism,not_removed,yeah but stalin did nothing wrong and gulags were amazing would be stalinist ussr not poststalin ussr
socialism,not_removed,you mean purged for revisionism purged for being a kulak purged for ultraleftism if youre going to be a sectarian do it right everyone is either not left enough or too left except your obscure splinter of the fourth international that somehow incorporates hoxhaism
socialism,not_removed,my sidessss
socialism,not_removed,please no
socialism,not_removed,maoists defend the dprk are you sure you know what maoism is
socialism,not_removed,luxury gay earth communism gold for luxury red for communism pinkpeach for lgbt and brown for earth
socialism,not_removed,you say take it back not trying to argue anymore but was there ever a time when blue was a socialist color
socialism,not_removed,its a pretty silly quote imo
socialism,not_removed,yeah i got banned because i like free speech among other things so are you saying that i didnt experience bigotry i have no idea what you have expeienced and you have no idea what i have experienced it is not cool in my mind to make such assumtions over a couple lines i wrote those guys over there are crazy if you think anything other than their little conception of anarchism then they shut you up why cant people have differing thoughts and still get along i love to have conversations with people that think differently than myself i might not like everthing they have to say but i have met some interesting people because i am willing to talk to different people
socialism,not_removed,yeah its not exactly either of those not all authoritarians are tankies though most are from experience a lot of them are just fascists who like the color red
socialism,not_removed,excellent suits me quite well i love our lgbt comrades i still get to keep it country and we should all have a little glamour in our lives rhinestones and velvet for everyone
socialism,not_removed,sorry i didnt mean take it back i just mean take it p
socialism,not_removed,its great to be honest wanting to keep capitalist structures like firms and coops is nothing but reactionary
socialism,not_removed,why cant people have differing thoughts and still get along because some thoughts hurt and delegitimize other people youre probably hurting someone by invalidating their struggle all this egalitarian stuff is just a way to spot the misogynistic racist people learn more about feminism and racism and maybe youll grow out of this phase
socialism,not_removed,yikes why are you here
socialism,not_removed,i guess it would be possible albeit a little strange
socialism,not_removed,no it hasnt the word came from the ussr intervention in hungary correct that was actually opposed by stalinists in the ussr the word changes all the fucking time and everyone uses it differently just to be clear ive never been called a tankie so im not saying this because im mad about that or something i just dislike the word
socialism,not_removed,whoops new definition then
socialism,not_removed,yo i found a movement that uses the color blue and would probably have most of this subreddit behind it and came back just to tell you comrade check out the dalit panthers in india
socialism,not_removed,im not saying i want to keep them as a market socialist i am still a communist i know that a world without markets is possible and desirable market socialism is my path toward that people who throw this quote around arent intelligently disagreeing they refuse to entertain the idea of transitional market socialism in any case i dont know whether a libertarian municipalist cooperative would even look like the firm the quotes referring to
socialism,not_removed,so its ok for me to be invalidated by somebody else because of how i was born if i say something that pisses somebody off and they tell me i like to step back and rethink myself when i say please dont hate me because i was born the way i was i get shit for it i understand that white cis males are responsible for a lot of bad shit i also understand that there are bad people in all walks of life and judgment should come at a personal level not lumping every person of a group together because of the bad apples my big issue with this is a user over at ranarchism complaining about bigots and then that same person wrote this pages long article that was all about fuck the cis white male they ate it up on that sub that seems pretty bigoted to me i dont want to eradicate any one group of people that is genocide yes there are lots of what i would consider shitty groups out there but i would rather take the teach and reform approach instead of the hate and kill approach at least until a person has shown they are not willing or able to be reformed but once again make it a personal and not a group thing also i was not aware that egalitarianism was a misogynistic racist platform i thought it was all about taking care of people i guess i need to do some reading i would apprieciate any links you have i admit wiki isnt best but i like it for quick reference the wiki on egalitarianisn pretty much hits it spot on for me and i see nothing about mysogyny or racism the quote by alexander berkman and the next two paragraphs before the marxism section are kinda how i feel about it
socialism,not_removed,because i feel judging people because of a certain group they were born into is lame and i want to live in a comunity that helps all who are willing to help or cant help themselves why is it ok to hate all cis white males that seems narrow minded and bigoted i get mad hate for saying this stuff but i do because i hope someday somebody will be able to tell me in a way i can understand the search for understanding is why i am here i need to understand why it is ok to hate me for the way i was born
socialism,not_removed,hey i like that a lot i cant believe you came back to tell me thanks comrade
socialism,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqyfmkihfzxg
socialism,not_removed,look into the antisexist manifesto i havent read it yet but it is recommended reading on feminism i dont have resources on race but a lookat police shootings will give you a good overview
socialism,not_removed,no one here or there hates all cis white males most of the people here are cis white males the thing is that we are all woke and recognize certain groups of people have advantages in society and find themselves in certain positions such as being members of the bourgeoisie from that we see that those same people are reluctant to realize this social phenomena hating all cis white males doesnt make any sense because we are that group some of them are woke eg and wish to deconstruct oppression and hating doesnt get anyone anywhere
socialism,not_removed,i dont know what else to say but that has not been my experience also how would i know you knew what you were talking about when the distribution of how its used is pretty even across my points
socialism,not_removed,i never got around to reading it but i understand that amadeo bordiga explained his concept of organic centralism best note im not advocating it or anything i just though it was relevant
socialism,not_removed,well huntergather and simple farming socialites are a lot more egalitarian then our societies with the urban revolution and the competition for farm land increasing people needed military leaders who over time would became kings feudalism developed in europe at least where the population wasnt large enough to be supported by slavery think of germany or france in ce compared to say egypt rural with a low population local warlords were give power by the regional lord who couldnt be in all locations at once capitalism came about with the growth of cities and population in europe and with the beginning of european imperialism pretty much all these changes can be traced back to a change in the material relationships between people and the surrounding environment you should read cannibals and kings the origins of cultures by marvin harris
socialism,not_removed,i highly suggest reading engels private property and the origin of the family for more but heres a quick breakdown of the birth of private property humanity started off living in small groups with many variations on the family but generally living in an economic mode best termed primitive communism cooperation was absolutely necessary for the survival of the group hunting gathering subsisting and small scale farming and never growing too large due to the limitations of food sources but always on shared land then the agricultural revolution happened alongside animal domesticationwhich was a historically male dominated activity now foraged land couldnt really be claimed as private property since it required hardly any work but cultivated land required a lot of workseeding dredging etc and more it was confined to a much smaller area which necessitated a need to protect it now this land was sometimes communally owned and controlled but it at least made private property possible but what made it more possible was animal domestication animals tended to be cared for by a family unit usually the male and passed down to male descendents this meant more economic security for those families and necessitated the growth of aristocratic families eventually hiring laborers to care for their land and animals the nature of private property also restricted and defined sexual relations to a monogamous family since passing down your property to your shared genes was essential this naturally lead to female isolation objectification and control and male private property owners wanted to make sure their mates primary role was to be a docile genetic vessel you can imagine how feudalism slavery and capitalism could arise from these early beginnings in aristocracyprivate property ownership
socialism,not_removed,you are looking for part viii of capital vol which is chapters particularly chapter deals with this question in specific western histories
socialism,not_removed,food surplus resulting from technological advances in early primitive societies enabled people more free time to make tools and goods which they could stockpile mutual cooperation had been a key characteristic of this sort of formation stockpiles and surplus helped not only in the formation of an early ruling class but also in the development of trade among different groups each having different economic conditions which influenced what they produced ernest mandel talks about this at length in his book marxist economic theory
socialism,not_removed,david graeber said it was the web of debt that turned free peasants into serfs
socialism,not_removed,iirc i think the very earliest iterations of it had to do with mysticismreligion you had a priest class that had special access to the godsspirits and so they put themselves on a higher plane than the common people this evolved over time to kings being gods themselves or descendants form god to being chosen by god to having their actions justified by god im sure im missing alot but this is the gist of it i think
socialism,not_removed,so agriculture and technology gave us the ability to be free from primitive life and we used the freedom for wars and kings that sounds sad
socialism,not_removed,actually im pretty sure capitalism came about due to the comparatively lower population in europe after the black death labor was suddenly in much higher demand due to there being less people alive and warlords needed to now pay people to do work for them as opposed to just having a ton of people working your land in exchange for food and shelter
socialism,not_removed,debt is definitely a book to add to the reading list if want to study this question is depth
socialism,not_removed,the record is a little confusing in sumeria a settlement belonged to a god and thus the priest along with council ruled the city once land became scarce because of the competition between cities a military leader had to be elected over time this post became more powerful then the rest and became hereditary the first kings the first slaves came from these first wars iirc there were some slight differences in china and egypt with the indus valley civilization we are possibly looking at merchant republics of some sort but we will never be because we cant read their writing there were some differences in the new world but i dont remember them at this point
socialism,not_removed,of course religion had a hand in it lmao
socialism,not_removed,freedom was given up or taken when out technology and agriculture brought different groups into conflict and people needed protection huntergatherers might have some boundary disputes but warfare is highly symbolic and with very few casualties and much rarer because of lower population density
socialism,not_removed,the black death took place in the middle of the century in the late medieval period serfdom didnt die out in the uk until the century and later in different parts of europe yes peasants had more leverage after the black death but they were still peasants and in a feudal system it took complex banking and finance the closer of the commons and the creation of the urban proletariat and the intensification and eventual industrialization of manufacturing all of these things took place a few centuries in the modern period and not in the late medieval period
socialism,not_removed,yeah plus they didnt have weapons damn i love technology but a lot of problems would be solved if their were no real advance weapons or fighting forces nothing to be done about it though
socialism,not_removed,i mean youre speaking about when our sort of understanding of modern capitalism was finally complete i was speaking about more of the early causes of it and where it came from
socialism,not_removed,yea but not the direct cause or nor is the beginning of capitalism it is before the transition
socialism,not_removed,i think it counts as a direct cause capitalism couldnt have evolved without the plague
socialism,not_removed,im not saying youre wrong but parts of asia and i think africa had a higher standard of living than medieval europe for a long time and there was a lot of trade around the indian ocean so why capitalism in europe and not in say coastal india and industrialization jumpstarted along the big rivers
socialism,not_removed,thats like saying the discovery of fire is a direct cause of the moon landing of course one couldnt happen without the other but one did not directly cause the other
socialism,not_removed,because they make for a convenient patsy
socialism,not_removed,which is exactly what israel wants the chief excuse for all the aid america sends them is its the only western style democracy in the middle east
socialism,not_removed,western style that just sounds imperialist
socialism,not_removed,no i support the kurds and the ypg in northern syria which offers a much better democracy and greater rights for all ethnic groups than israel
socialism,not_removed,thats because it is
socialism,not_removed,i support kurdistan too that doesnt make israel fair less free and tolerant than the vast majority of the middle east
socialism,not_removed,i didnt know we support someone because theyre somewhat better than a different option especially when theres an example thats significantly better highlighting the formers shortcomings
socialism,not_removed,youre right but lets not pretend israels shit dont stink
socialism,not_removed,fair less free and tolerant so free they need walls to divide your own citizens that they conduct military campaigns without warning
socialism,not_removed,deleted
socialism,not_removed,i hope this spreads itd be hilarious of an actual democratically socialist society revolted against the state capitalist party masquerading as communism
socialism,not_removed,man wish the media payed as much attention to the millions protesting in france than in every small rebellion in china literally havent seen a single notice board mentioning they had a general strike people know because of social media
socialism,not_removed,even so theres a difference between real democracy and bourgeois democracy this little village isnt the ideologically pure savior of the world but at least theyre not bourgeois democracy
socialism,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwhataboutism literally havent seen a single notice board mentioning they had a general strike yeah cus everyone knows chinese state media wants to tell their citizens that a group of people are successfully rebelling against police forces its like how every state wants to bring about its own demise
socialism,not_removed,dont rely on bourgeois media
socialism,not_removed,my god your soft apologism for the chinese state is horrendous why dont you just admit that you love the state and hate the masses already
socialism,not_removed,ive seen multiple news stories about france there have been several articles posted to rsocialism over the last month they even made it to the front page of the bbc a handful of times this is the first story about labour unrest in china ive heard for a while i wouldnt of even heard about it if it hadnt been posted to rsocialism stop your whining
socialism,not_removed,and yet theyre still state capitalist my point stands
socialism,not_removed,edit well cleary they arent if even reuters can inform us and take pictures about it chinese state media wants to tell their citizens that a group of people are successfully rebelling against police forces successfully rebelling against police forces have you even took a look at the pictures theyre waving chinese state flags this isnt some kind of antistate uprising
socialism,not_removed,i dont double standards of it just piss me off
socialism,not_removed,stop being a sectarian ultra tbqh
socialism,not_removed,i never disagreed with you
socialism,not_removed,could you explain how they are state capitalist and not just plain old regular capitalist
socialism,not_removed,strikes arent somehow illegal in china more than riot and paramilitary police in helmets and shields watched as the villagers young and old streamed around the village perimeter in a long procession some jeering at the officers as they went and pumping their fists in the air do not assemble and protest again notices posted by the regional government in the village read do that at your own risk sure have you even took a look at the pictures theyre waving chinese state flags this isnt some kind of antistate uprising unlike you i dont judge the content of a movement based on its flag
socialism,not_removed,edit well cleary they arent censoring good enough if even reuters can inform us and take pictures about it yeah so theyre bad at censorship so what
socialism,not_removed,ill stop being sectarian when the actual sectarians who side with reactionary states and bend back hard to condemn any sort of resistance from the people stop first i dont understand what it is some communists see salvagable in the current cpc at all or anything worth apologizing for
socialism,not_removed,yes you did he said the were masquerading as communists but you said they werent
socialism,not_removed,extremely large stateowned industries which does not exist in the usabritainchilemoroccojapan
socialism,not_removed,nothing just that the point made above wasnt accurate
socialism,not_removed,for once i agree with a maoist
socialism,not_removed,i meant in regards to the thing we were discussing
socialism,not_removed,well it clearly was accurate unless youre trying to imply that the chinese state is gracious enough to allow news media to see the protest wow what a gift they have given those lowly proles
socialism,not_removed,so then why the accusation of ultraleftism if in agreementalthough am not surprised by the accusation being mlm
socialism,not_removed,i guess
socialism,not_removed,i was making a joke im an ultra

socialism,not_removed,omfg the comment section is infuriating how could the masses have such disregard for the plight of their fellow workers
socialism,not_removed,wow im surprised cnnmoney did this video a corporate and financial channel how ironic
socialism,not_removed,is your flair a reference to jack swagger
socialism,not_removed,first world people gat too much problems i live in china i saw workers be paid even my dad a collage professor paid only and i know it is not the worst indeed it is better a lot of countries
socialism,not_removed,child labor on the cheap exactly what puerto rico needs s
socialism,not_removed,im with you comrade i dont understand why they cant understand that even if she got a better job her low paying job would be back filled because it was a necessary job it makes me so angry that they dont understand that of americans make under an hour and that percentage goes up dramatically for minorities why doesnt of americans quit being lazy and get a better job ignorance
socialism,not_removed,my thoughts exactly
socialism,not_removed,hahahaha somewhat
socialism,not_removed,i hope obamas legacy includes his donothing behavior when it comes to social movements his abandoning of people in need his expansion of bushera surveillance policies his expansion of executive branch power to kill people at will i hope his legacy is that of george w bushs third and fourth terms
socialism,not_removed,socialismcommunism is a stateless moneyless classless global society where the means of production are collectivized the value form is abolished and production is for use this alienation to use a term which will be comprehensible to the philosophers can of course only be abolished given two practical premises for it to become an intolerable power ie a power against which men make a revolution it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity propertyless and produced at the same time the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power a high degree of its development and on the other hand this development of productive forces which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their worldhistorical instead of local being is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced and furthermore because only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the propertyless mass universal competition makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others and finally has put worldhistorical empirically universal individuals in place of local ones without this communism could only exist as a local event the forces of intercourse themselves could not have developed as universal hence intolerable powers they would have remained homebred conditions surrounded by superstition and each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism empirically communism is only possible as the act of the dominant peoples all at once and simultaneously which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism moreover the mass of propertyless workers – the utterly precarious position of labour – power on a mass scale cut off from capital or from even a limited satisfaction and therefore no longer merely temporarily deprived of work itself as a secure source of life – presupposes the world market through competition the proletariat can thus only exist worldhistorically just as communism its activity can only have a worldhistorical existence worldhistorical existence of individuals means existence of individuals which is directly linked up with world history communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established an ideal to which reality have to adjust itself we call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things the conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence
socialism,not_removed,definitions will never be abstract constants words are defined by how people use them if we want socialism to mean workers control of the means of production then we as socialists must demand so and act upon it only by gaining support for our ideas through the success of our actions and organisations will people come to use the definition of socialism as we use theres no point trying to start a dictionary definition debate over it
socialism,not_removed,worker ownership over the means of production this is all fine and good but what are the workers doing with said means of producing goods and services are they still utilizing the value form of commodities if so then the fundamental aspect of production hasnt changed and the commodity would still rule over our lives
socialism,not_removed,socialismcommunism is a stateless moneyless classless global society where the means of production are collectivized the value form is abolished and production is for use socialism is not the same than communism socialism is a temporal solution before the development of communism the ruling class in the state will manage the production with the idea that you get as much as you contribute
socialism,not_removed,this anyone who disagrees with it would just say damn socialists trying to make people think thats what they want thats not what they really want you gotta show them you want it
socialism,not_removed,no they are the same thing it was lenin who started the whole socialism is the step in between communism and capitalismmeme
socialism,not_removed,kaepernick to ask obama to think about the pain obamas causing military families
socialism,not_removed,i love the irony in this the leader of the military asks that they consider the victims of the wars he directs while calling for their opponents to listen to those that are unfairly killed by the police he is supposed to be responsible of
socialism,not_removed,rshitliberalssay
socialism,not_removed,obama also said people on both sides of the issue should keep open ears golly gee cant we just open our ears to the sound of black people being killed by cops
socialism,not_removed,this is just sad
socialism,not_removed,my ears have been open to the other side for far too long all i hear is the war cry of murderers and plunderers
socialism,not_removed,article seems to say that most people oppose the plebiscite out of principle ie basic rights like this shouldnt be up to a popular vote or fear ie it might actually fail my knowledge was that it was more a matter of everyone already knowing that most regular australians support gay marriage and that a majority of politicians if given a conscience vote also support gay marriage so a plebiscite would simply be a tremendous waste of time and money and also be delaying what should be a simple affair that should have been solved years ago
socialism,not_removed,australian here this is why i dont support a plebiscite on marriage equality it is already common knowledge that the majority of australians support marriage so it is a waste of time it will give hate groups a platform the spread their hatred on in the quarter it is set for see the referendums in the uk and ireland its not going to be binding we know that much many liberal mps including frontbenchers have implied they would vote against the bill in parliament regardless of the result it wont be until february so take the bill to the floor and vote you fuckers
socialism,not_removed,there have been issues with socialist organizations crashing the protests of various groups particularly indigenous ones trying to talk over them rather than listen to their detriment recently there have been submissions by peak bodies of psychologists etc showing concern about the harm to queer people the increased mental health issues suicidality bashings etc resulting from the outpouring of bigotry that will occur in the event of a public debate around a plebiscite on ssm there have been surveys done of the queer community in australia showing strong broad opposition to a plebiscite they dont want to walk down the isle over a stream of blood thats a quote theres still a minority of radicals within the queer community that see marriage as a conservative coercive institution the campaign for which is sucking energy away from other queer struggles ignoring all these factors or putting them down to misplaced fear of the working class majority is not a recipe for success
socialism,not_removed,can you bring african food httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofethnicgroupsofafrica
socialism,not_removed,can someone explain i dont live in a society biased against me being a white american so i dont live my life experiencing these stereotypes i dont really understand
socialism,not_removed,i think what hes trying to do is expose unaware people to the harsh reality of racism that still exists in the world
socialism,not_removed,let me say this this is probably a question white people seldom get of course there are exceptions
socialism,not_removed,its not necessarily bad considering its usually asked out of ignorance but it insinuates the person being discussed is an exotic rarity which can contribute to issues of fetishization or part of an other rather than part of the community it prioritizes ethnic background which is usually not at the forefront of brown peoples minds theyre not usually walking around thinking about the color of their skin all the time its only when other people point it out that its made conscious so its in part rude because the person asking the question is self serving of their curiosity without taking in consideration the perceptionidentity of the person being asked often trivializing their sense of belonging
socialism,not_removed,well im from ireland feel free to pm me im a free lance odd jobber in the garment industry and a horse dealer my boyfriend is a former factory butcher but he is at college now still does the odd bit of butchering when he can get it we live in an extended family situation and currently have horses around the place until spring dogs and cats
socialism,not_removed,pm me if you want comrade from ohio
socialism,not_removed,comrade from georgia reporting is there something you wanted to talk about in particular
socialism,not_removed,there is indeed a connection between immigration and crime just not the one all the racists think there is
socialism,not_removed,at least dead too from my sources
socialism,not_removed,i dont think brigrading it will do to good and its also aguisnt the site rules
socialism,not_removed,do you think any of these places are ready for a violent revolution
socialism,not_removed,not but thats because they dont have the conditions for a revolution we need to build a movement that is large before we move to revolutionary action
socialism,not_removed,there are a ton of such groups the question is not of fighting spirit but of material and ideological conditions in those societies in germany there are two countrywide radical leftist orgs of note umsganze and interventionistische linke il
socialism,not_removed,inside the us not really any leftist group that is formed no matter whether its independent adults or just a group of high school kids gets marked by the fbi
socialism,not_removed,no
socialism,not_removed,if a large scale socialist revolution is to happen anytime soon india definitely seems like the place where it will happen
socialism,not_removed,id say things will have to get a lot worse for people to really feel bothered to do something and need the thinking rather than the fed brainwashing horseshit we have been taught since birth its pretty hard to think ahead when your worried about getting food on the table today the bourgeoisie got us right where they want us disillusioned hungry and brainwashed with of republicans voting against their very beliefs there was a study on this somewhere but am on mobile so cant link it yet and were definitely far away from falgsc probably not happening in our lifetimes france seems like an exception though they started the paris commune after all and theyre still fighting hard against their labor reforms today
socialism,not_removed,we basically just need to wait until capitalism further decouples from being able to provide the bulk of the population with a decent standard of living here in the west many developing nations with large swaths of the population in poverty have pretty solid leftist insurgencies that seldom get mentioned in the mainstream eg naxalites
socialism,not_removed,could you elaborate why you think that existing leftcom groups cant be revolutionary even if they are of course not in any way able to revolutionize anything i always thought the word was a discription of political intend not of the probability of success
socialism,not_removed,i think youre right that things will have to get worse before we can change anything on a big scale unfortunately the conditions right now are such that if there was a revolution odds are it would be a fascist one just look at trump hes getting support for using proto fascist rhetoric when sanders could barely get support using social democratic rhetoric we need to keep spreading marxist ideas so that when the conditions are ripe the workers are ready thats why posts like this are completely idealist the masses simply arent ideologically ready yet
socialism,not_removed,france is in the same boat as america and the rest of the west any support that left groups had in the past has gone to national front fascists
socialism,not_removed,the court wasnt disbanded they are held in contempt until the opposition complies with the rulings that opposition lawmakers could not be sworn in due to electoral fraud if the na complies then it would be reversed they wont because this is exactly what the imperialists need after a horrible setback in the oas
socialism,not_removed,if the us didnt try to rule every nation in the world this wouldnt happen
socialism,not_removed,how likely is a war in venezuela i feel like trump is hawkish enough to attempt it and might be able to bring unity with both of the parties by liberating the venezuelans
socialism,not_removed,oh man the comments on mainstream reddit are terrible everyone is buying into the western media spin bullshit
socialism,not_removed,look no matter how you guys look at the situation or view hugos legacy maduro defintely has not made the situation any better and whether you really believe this is a coup or not the fact remains that maduro has complete authority over the supreme court which has blocked almost everything the parliament has tried to pass the central bank stopped publishing data on growth or inflation since the beginning of in an attempt to paint a rosier picture of the situation i understand how capitalism can strike when my home country of egypt adopted free market policies in the it destroyed the middle class but we need to admit to ourselves that socialist regimes and policies can faulter if not applied correctly and especially when a govermnent begins to think that everything that goes wrong is not its fault maduros party cannot and will not stay in power forever and the longer it resists any cirticisms the more people will be dissuaded from accepting more credible socialist govermnents in the future look at rafael correa in ecuador he has been able to sucssefuly implement populist policies without torpedoing the economy sidelining the opposition and attempting to control all institutions
socialism,not_removed,i think it was mao who said that duringafter the revolution class contradictions dont disappear but rather intensify is this what weve seen to some extent in venezuela
socialism,not_removed,i feel like ive been seeing a lot of people defend the governments actions because theyre legal and constitutional but so were the coups in brazil and paraguay werent they
socialism,not_removed,thanks ill update the thread with this
socialism,not_removed,fyi the assembly removed the sworn lawmakers also the supreme court hasnt declare reelections for that state for months now and guess they arent going declare anything abou it since they know that now they will even lose the only one psuv lawmaker that won in that state and theyre delaying the regional elections as well since they know they will lose and in this process they requested that all political parties need to be re validate and the communist party itself ally of the psuv is against this process and declare that they arent going to do it they will disappear in other words even they cant stand this shit
socialism,not_removed,la única forma de disolver la asamblea entendiendo que disolución es adelanto de elecciones es que el presidente puede hacerlo cuando el vicepresidente de la república ha sido removido tres veces a causa de tres mociones de censura httpsupuestonegadocomwebhermannescarraasambleanacional the only way to dissolve the assembly understanding that dissolution is the advance of elections is that the president can do so when the vice president of the republic has been removed three times because of three motions of no confidence
socialism,not_removed,i used to live in venezuela from i am american and i would be interested in hearing how us involvement has contributed to our caused the current situation in venezuela
socialism,not_removed,yeah because us intervention in japan was very bad for that country
socialism,not_removed,looking at the frenzy of rworldnews this may be a likely reality
socialism,not_removed,the same could be said about any post about international politics on reddit nine times out of ten its just american rightwingers who dont know anything about what theyre talking about in those comment sections
socialism,not_removed,also the comment here are terrible too they ignore our suffering to push their agenda
socialism,not_removed,not to mention without arming extrajudicial gangs to crush political opposition where it occurs there is a way to improve the situation of the people and this is not it sometimes the enemy of your enemy is not your friend but some people here seem so desperate to believe in anything that opposes usa imperialism especially if it uses the language of the left
socialism,not_removed,yes except venezuela never really became socialist not like china did the bourgeoisie is still in charge there and the same capitalist basesuperstructure is in place class struggle never started to begin with and it certainly did not intensify after chavez it was all still social democracy
socialism,not_removed,this is false as hell well most of it they never found to have committed any fraud because they never investigate the case it was based in empty and proofless accusation of fraud there was nothing to investigate so they just ignored it also the na removed the guys a few weeks later that month but the supreme court didnt change his decision some months later the na added the guys back and the supreme court cried again they removed the guys again they keep saying that the na is still contempt why isnt there a single word about how the chavismo ninja changed the court the christmas night their election was unconstitutional for several reason and the law was crystal clear about it they also banned the na from investigating their election and this is one of the na job btw supreme court chairman is an excon or about how the court removed the parlimentary immunity like hours ago because reasons where is your proof for any of this at least we have news resources that are not jumping to conclusions we have other media analysis and personal experiences as well explaining our side of the thread besides telesur and like the tread said they did not dissolve the na just held it in contempt for propagating fraud everything they have done so far has been according to the venezuelan constitution but am i not surprised that this is coming form a regular of rvzla
socialism,not_removed,there is a bad smell in this thread just because you believe in the principles of socialism doesnt mean you should shut your eyes and ears to what is going on in venezuela im very disappointed in some people in this thread its not even on the one hand the chavistas have done these terrible things but on the other hand the opposition they face has done this its pure denialism honestly whats the different between this and talking about how america supports global democracy its just as intellectually dishonest if you think that the chavez government still on balance is better than the alternatives and that things other than the govt are causing the current problems in venezuela then make your case dont just go lalalala everything is fine and shut your eyes to everything that the govt there is doing
socialism,not_removed,are you also considering the how constitutional is it with foreign powers influencing such processes
socialism,not_removed,venezuela has essentially turned into a dictatorship or a one party system now excuse me while i have to vote democrat or republican because i have choices
socialism,not_removed,have you seen our hash tag bash the facist
socialism,not_removed,someone does not know their political ideologies oh another regular from rvzla not surprising
socialism,not_removed,oh no seized some toys i want him to seize the entire means of production and expel the capitalists somehow i feel you will complain about that too mr chavista lol
socialism,not_removed,where are you getting your facts cuba has much better health care literacy rates and education since the revolution the south korean economy is propped up by the us they didnt grow their wealth inhouse they were supported by foreign aid loans and investment this was done to make an example of dprk and cast capitalism in a better light during the cold war
socialism,not_removed,they dont have socialism they have state capitalism
socialism,not_removed,glad to help comrade
socialism,not_removed,us involvement in latin america in general had crippled the economy of these countries through government power struggles and puppet dictatorships to align private interests corporations with cheap sources of resources and labor for the states the us has preserved wide income gaps rigged elections and killed opposers leftists for this business deal are only the beginning of american influences when it comes to national resources in the region specifically for venezuela private interests hoarding and and lots of other us infiltrations
socialism,not_removed,lmao another way of the bern liberal who doesnt know anything about latino america or its history and claims others are not self aware hypocrisy at its finest
socialism,not_removed,oh look another unflaired user derailing the conversation and with a day old account too fuck off
socialism,not_removed,so good outcome look at chile vietnam cambodia iran guatemala iraq korea argentina brasil nicaragua honduras serbia or general yugoslavian nations somalia bolivia laos cuba colombia venezuela you gonna tell me these benefited from us backed terrorism
socialism,not_removed,i dont really think that the end justifies the means in that case
socialism,not_removed,ive heard rumors a couple of weeks ago that the us is going to start another war soon obviously rumors should be taken with a heap of salt but trumps administration is leakier than my dorms faucet
socialism,not_removed,oh well if proof you want all in also httpwwwelmundocomvenoticiasactualidadpoliticarevelannuevaspruebasdelpresuntofraudeelectoraspx is the proof about fraud mind you this was back in early and they havent done anything about it everything they have done so far has been according to the venezuelan constitution this is my biggest issue with nonvenezuelan talking about us they really arent aware of all the bullshit going on let me tell you first the tsj has violated the constitution several times before from illegaly extending the decreto de emergencia economica you can only do this once to taking the memoria y cuenta of the president and vicepresident the constitution states that they arent supposed to do this also they showed the years budget in the tsj and wasnt allowed to be checked by the an also highly illegal cause they have to checked how much money is given to different groups also not only was the designation of the members of the tsj illegal it happened at one moment it wasnt supposed to be like five days after the an won and these elections have to be overseen by the an most of then were members of the psuv which is ilegal or dont have the correct acreditations they need to have a long list of acreditations that most of them lack once again violating the constitution also the now president of the tsj maikel moreno was a cop that was involved in the murder of two people also yes the an removed the ilegal members twice and the tsj ignored this to keep them in contempt and what pisses the country the most is that million people voted for the mud most of us arent rich we are just tired of being lied to and the huge amount of corruption that the psuv has and now our rights apparently are meaningless so yes stop lying
socialism,not_removed,what article says that the tsj can be the legislative body
socialism,not_removed,everything they have done so far has been according to the venezuelan constitution what article says that the tsj can be the legislative body
socialism,not_removed,dont just go lalalala everything is fine and shut your eyes to everything that the govt there is doing that is what you are doing when you suggest that venezuelans return to neoliberal policies that are responsible for millions of death in the global south isnt it
socialism,not_removed,nobody is shutting eyes or ears to what is going on in venezuela we are expressing solidarity and support with the venezuelan people and the bolivarian revolution and of course we are critical of the psuv particularly the nationalist elements that oppose the further construction of socialism however the psuv is infinitely better than mud which is dominated by the radical right wing popular will program that has a program of neoliberalism and wholesale privatizations that would be disaster for poor and working venezuelans who have gained a lot during the revolution the opposition is clearly allied with the big producers and importers and it is they who are hoarding and speculating on goods not the psuv which is trying to ensure that poor and working people are able to afford goods during the republic the poor were unable to purchase staple goods such as diapers bread etc because they couldnt afford it price controls are meant to address that keep in mind while the economic crisis is bad in every capitalist country in the world there is rationingshortages of goods as well it is just rationing for the poor as in of americans cant afford to buy groceries and have empty or nearly empty kitchen cabinets despite the fact that food is on supermarket shelves and being thrown out as i said earlier these producers and importers are taking preferential dollars and diverting their goods to the black market and hoarding the goods illegally in warehouses the government is no longer able to afford exclusively importing goods itself because oil prices have crashed obviously the exchange rate controls need to be reformed but the real issue is the state is catering to big business interests allowing them to carry out this economic sabotage psuv needs to expropriate all major producers and importers and put them under democratic worker control to really address the crisis socialism requires a public monopoly of trade and production to prevent private enterprises sabotaging and ruthlessly taking advantage of the system to make exorbitant profit no one is denying hardship the economic war has created we are just blaming big business interests rather than a government trying to work for poor and working people never forget the amazing gains of the bolivarian revolution over million clean quality public housing units have been built and to clear out slums where people had no drinking water or electricity nobody is talking about how there has been a massive increase in access to clean drinking water electricity and safe housing the bolivarian government has provided free healthcare and education to millions of venezuelans no body is talking about all of the student debt erased and the millions of degrees people have earned no body is talking about the millions of sick people who have received healthcare that is the propaganda of the mainstream corporate media only focusing on the worst aspects of the economic crisis
socialism,not_removed,this its refreshing to finally see some reason on this thread
socialism,not_removed,i dont want this revolution fail my country vietnam steady become dictatorship capitalist with useless peoples power
socialism,not_removed,whats that have to do with venezuela i dont think they ever said they approved of the us system either did they
socialism,not_removed,hey redmacaw do you truly consider yourself a chavista for real this is coming from a venezuelan
socialism,not_removed,while this is true it is primarily the venezuelan billionairemillionaire class that is aligned with the opposition causing the crisis they have been using their big importing businesses to divert goods bought with preferential dollars to the black market they have been using their food production companies to cut production or divert production to the black market then smaller businesses are also doing this in response creating shortages of subsidized goods while they have been doing this essentially since the beginning of price controls after the failed usback coup of chavez it has only been effective over the last two years since the collapse of the oil market the bolivarian government was importing much more goods when it was making money off of oil now this is not possible and the sabotage of the billionaire class is taking its toll the government has put million people onto the clap program meaning that the poor who rely on subsidized goods are now getting these goods delivered to their homes through community committees this is fighting the hoarding of the average consumer who would buy more than needed of a certain good in stores because the big businesses have created artificial scarcity this wont solve the issue there are two roads collapse of the revolution where goods would return to market price and the poor would not be able to afford them anyway as was the case prior to the revolution or the other option is the radicalization of the revolution with widespread nationalization there is not a public monopoly on production on trade or production in venezuela despite over years of revolution public monopoly of trade and production is crucial for the success of socialist construction because it takes away the power of the bourgeoisie to create economic sabotage as they are doing now maduro and the mainstream psuv want to hold power but they seem to be hesitant to do anything to the national bourgeoisie and instead are intent on trying to negotiate with them this wont work they will continue economic sabotage to defend their interests against the poor and working people of venezuela
socialism,not_removed,ohh the irony its not latino america i seriously question your historical knowledge given that you dont even know how to spell the name
socialism,not_removed,s korea is one of the and is doing pretty well for themselves ignoring the chinese backed north ofc
socialism,not_removed,werent those countries already bad before the us intervened in them
socialism,not_removed,so when does it does
socialism,not_removed,probably iran more likely than anywhere in south america
socialism,not_removed,ive been hearing the same if it is true i would think either dprk or syria or both doubtful against iran or venezuela right now atleast
socialism,not_removed,whoa whoa whoa are we talking about the na or tsj because now you are diverting the discussion about the integrity of the tsj rather than the legitimacy of the na the only article you linked about the fraud was from el mundo and this case that was just decided by the supreme court was in response to the nas contempt for swearing members that were convicted of said fraud so mind you in response to your mind you this was back in early and they havent done anything about it yes the court have responded and the na didnt do anything about it so the court responded again with this response now about the constitutionality of this ruling i am not going to get sidetracked by attacking the reputations of other judges or magistrates of the court because that is diverting the focus of this discussion httpwwwvenezuelaemborkrenglishconstitutionofthebolivarianinglespdf unless you have a constitutional provision or other legal precedent that states you can only do this once i am not finding any violation of holding the na in contempt for this
socialism,not_removed,what law did the judiciary pass by interpreting their own constitution by holding their na in contempt for swearing in illegitimate politicians
socialism,not_removed,in what way am i advocating that so what the choices we have are either a failing dictatorial state or neoliberalism there are plenty of left latin american governments doing a much better job than the pisspoor state of affairs in venezuela for the last few years is anyone who complains about a specific capitalist government advocating for fucking north korea if not then why do you view any criticism of anyone on the left as advocating for fucking pinochet
socialism,not_removed,mud which is dominated by the radical right wing popular will program that has a program of neoliberalism and wholesale privatizations what makes you say this you do know that that before chavez oil was nationalized already right and that we had public health care and public obligatory education right and it was one of the best in its times nothing like the current public health care where you only receive the attention free after waiting on the floor for even days you have to pay everything single supplement medicine etc even the freaking gloves also before chavez we had currency controls when oil prices drop to prevent immediate devaluation of the currency not the terrible year one that we have already and price regulations as well for essential goods as well that essential goods didnt have to pay iva we even had a housing project psuv needs to expropriate all major producers and importers and put them under democratic worker control to really address the crisis they did that already the only big company remaining is empresas polar and are constantly being supervised by the military they actually dont expropriate that one because its the only thing they have left to blame nobody is talking about how there has been a massive increase in access to clean drinking water electricity and their subsequent outage
socialism,not_removed,its refreshing to finally see some reason on this thread go fuck yourself with your belittling language asshole
socialism,not_removed,vietnam along with china has become a capitalistic dictatorships in most sense but in venezuela they are actually fighting against capitalistic influences for the sake of their people but vietnam does show how easily capitalism can seep into socialistic countries again
socialism,not_removed,pointing out the irony that a one party systemdictatorship must stand up against tyranny while the us have two mainstream parties that are essentially the same thing
socialism,not_removed,im chavista but i wont support these fascists if you claim socialists can be fascists you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about please study what being a chavista really is before stating such an ignorant statement
socialism,not_removed,thats your measure for governmental success people emigrating or immigrating from a country therefore socialism is bad nevermind they are having a higher quality of life over the rest of central and south america but letting wealthy imperialist economically develop a third world country for their own gain cough erm i mean foreign direct investment or capitalist playgrounds cough markets infect these countries have better human development indexes than those like cuba yeah ask mexico and brazil how thats going for them
socialism,not_removed,if my business is struggling and a friend gives me money to help me out that doesnt make my business model better this is the situation in south korea in a nutshell they were struggling after the korean war and the north was doing well until the mid then came heavy investments in south korea and increased sanctions on the north do you have any idea what conditions in cuba were like under the usbacked capitalist batista regime its a tiny island community that has never had large amounts of wealth and is a lot more stable postrevolution than it was previously
socialism,not_removed,what hurts me most is poverty and thats what led me to become a rebel hugo chavez
socialism,not_removed,pretty good analysis any sources about the billionairemillionaire class and bolivarian sabotages
socialism,not_removed,maduro and the mainstream psuv want to hold power but they seem to be hesitant to do anything to the national bourgeoisie the military vests power in the psuv and the military also facilitates black market smuggling its no surprise the psuv dont do anything to the national bourgeoisie they cant
socialism,not_removed,why do you refer to it as billionairemillionaire class there are only two classes the proletariat and bourgeoisie
socialism,not_removed,ok i will not even argue this this is bullshit this just makes no sense im writing this from venezuela
socialism,not_removed,yeah very politically stable no mass demonstrations no party bans no past dictatorships its great
socialism,not_removed,apparently you havent heard of the also bad for who the west didnt they commit a genocide of a bunch of natives because of that mentality
socialism,not_removed,venezuela has a massive resource the us always goes to war for oil
socialism,not_removed,venusizala has a massive resource the us always goes to war for oil
socialism,not_removed,from the cne itself it states dicho estado de excepción durará hasta treinta días siendo prorrogable hasta por treinta días más such exception state will last thirty days being extendable for another days the one that says days is in the case of stuff like civil wars the government isnt working with that one and it has been stated several times that after the first extension of days you cannot continue extending it this is ilegal also we are in the or extension and nothing has changed so theres also that also la aprobación de la prórroga de los estados de excepción corresponde a la asamblea nacional the people that states if you can or cant extend the exception thing is the national assembly not the tsj they more than once said no cause well it is not achieving anything other than giving extra power to maduro guy has too much already but they have been ignored btw what the hell is up with that constitution the one i found not only in the cne but in the public minister both of venezuela dont mention anything about a days emergency not even joking who added that there also article el decreto que declare el estado de excepción en el cual se regulará el ejercicio del derecho cuya garantía se restringe será presentado dentro de los ocho días siguientes de haberse dictado a la asamblea nacional o a la comisión delegada para su consideración y aprobación y a la sala constitucional del tribunal supremo de justicia para que se pronuncie sobre su constitucionalidad el decreto cumplirá con las exigencias principios y garantías establecidos en el pacto internacional de derechos civiles y políticos y en la convención americana sobre derechos humanos el presidente o presidenta de la república podrá solicitar su prórroga por un plazo igual y será revocado por el ejecutivo nacional o por la asamblea nacional o por su comisión delegada antes del término señalado al cesar las causas que lo motivaron it states that the state of economic emergency will be checked by the tsj to check if its constitutional stating if its or not legal no more than this then the an aproves or not if it happens once again the tsj has ignored this alright the amazonas an members choosed to be deincorporated at the beginning of that year expecting either a definitive answer if they are or not legal or elections you know a doover being a good sport that was over a year ago in a year you can do quite a lot and they havent done anything after a lot of waiting and after the accusation was sort of dropped cause it wasnt followed and nothing was done about it the an members were incorporated again cause well if nothing is being done at all a whole state has no representation so once again the tsj was in an outcry and it takes us to this day btw i focused into the tsj thing cause you asked about where is your proof for any of this this is something that could have been fixed in a month but whenever they ask the government for any kind of election like the regional ones that were supposed to happen or the revocation of the president that was also illegaly axed they go we dont have money for that also the people dont want elections spoilers we do
socialism,not_removed,the na didnt do anything about it httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpjirusgdqny
socialism,not_removed,yes thats what im asking
socialism,not_removed,belittling language go fuck yourself asshole
socialism,not_removed,nope if power dont share to everyone with free willpluralismmultiparty system they will soon become dictatorship with corruption socialistall benefits for sake of the elite membership like china or vietnam
socialism,not_removed,you can oppose both
socialism,not_removed,lol im sorry was typing this comment to him and it got deleted before i could send im gonna post it here just so i dont feel so neutered and add to what youre saying the fundamental truth is that people migrating from latin america come north because it is where the wealth is and the idea of an american dream is most easily sold to people who dont see the american realities for poor migrant communities simply put people in poorer countries will migrate to richer ones this is a global phenomenon if you dont condemn the migration from capitalist haiti capitalist mexico capitalist colombia as a failing of capitalism what leg are you standing on there maybe you think the migrant workforce of the gulf states is proof of absolute monarchy as a superior system hell india is where most the workforce is from and that place is capitalist as fuck lmao people flee to cuba and not only political exiles theres a strong immigrant haitian population for one is this proof of socialism being a superior system no not really but it does solidify the point that people move where they will find better opportunities
socialism,not_removed,ive used venezuelanalysisorg and telesur english to get leftist analysis of what is going on these are the best sources for probolivarian analysis of venezuela venezuela analysis is more critical then telesur and has more diverse content i would encourage you to browse their economy section of course ive also read the corporate medias spin on this as well what i posted here is my analysis after having read a lot on venezuela over the past several years and also hearing first hand accounts
socialism,not_removed,this may be true i dont have to many details on this but from what i hear a lot of it stems from the fact that the psuv is a big tent party with large mainstream currents being more nationalist and less socialist there are nationalist currents in the party that are fine with the revolution as is and do not see the need to advance the revolution and would rather go back to how things were in this faction thinks free market bandaid tweaks will solve the crisis and they are not interested in expropriating the bourgeoisie any further
socialism,not_removed,yes of course you are right but many people dont know what the words bourgeoise and proletariat mean substituting billionaires class and working class help people understand class analysis
socialism,not_removed,is it whats the problem then in your view what is your explanation for why polices that worked for years all of a sudden stop working when there is a less popular president elected and an oil reliant nation sees the oil market collapse that points to economic sabotage in my books
socialism,not_removed,compared to the rest of those countries yeah their political structure may be a doozy but in terms of qol and hdi and such s korea is objectively doing pretty well for their citizens at least on the materiel front and to be far i could make the same comments about tons of countries i could probably list half of europe germany being the obvious one and one of the many countries that had major us intervention
socialism,not_removed,upvoting because proper spelling is overrated nowadays
socialism,not_removed,all i can show are twitter feeds showing large military movements mainly towards the coasts along with rhetoric from the trumpist regime seems to indicate dprk or syria
socialism,not_removed,they are going to maintain their status as assembly members but will not participate in assembly matters as the investigation continues so the opposition reaps the benefits of having an illegitimate majority while those being investigate stay out of their business yep no reason to worry here s
socialism,not_removed,care to get into that at all take your pick man i find it hard to believe that the chavistas are your favourite latin american govt from the last years im not sure what you are going on about here i was being a little hyperbolic but you did accuse me of advocating for neoliberalism just because i said im not a fan of the chavistas thats really not all that different from the standard redditor well if you hate america so much why dont you just move to syria and see how you like that its like just because im anti one thing doesnt mean im pro a shit alternative
socialism,not_removed,how about cuba chile uruguay
socialism,not_removed,i am a bit more lenient for venezuela than i am for china or vietnam venezuela is trying its best to fend off capitalist forces while china and vietnam let capitalist influences seep in their political structures yes their economy mainly based on oil is causing recession but there is plenty more that meets the eye when price raising hoarding and burying supplies become tactics for the private interests in venezuela
socialism,not_removed,not one mention of the goldstandard source on venezuela
socialism,not_removed,i see what you are saying but not all bourgeoisie are millionbillionaire small businesses
socialism,not_removed,because those polices never worked the oil price was so high that the goverment was able to hide that once the oil price droped the system colapsed
socialism,not_removed,id rather live in cuba times more than rok or any other country you can list chances are ive already lived in most of them its an empty shell looks real nice but then you see the pain of the people who live there from the homeless starving to the rich who cannot spend time with their families and are so stressed they cannot spend minutes with their children without yelling at them why do you think suicide is so prevalent in rok people are industrialy trained and pumped out to serve the capitalist machine like cattle
socialism,not_removed,it auto corrected lol
socialism,not_removed,sorry what
socialism,not_removed,calling someone an asshole and telling them to go fuck themselves just because they called your position on a specific topic unreasonable is a childish thing to do i mean really what do you hope to achieve with that attitude i personally dont even have a problem with their comment but even if i did id reply by explaining why i thought they should reconsider their words rather than just throw insults like a kid who got their toy taken away
socialism,not_removed,and so you feel cnn sand fox news are unbiased sources
socialism,not_removed,i agree completely about the inherent divide between labor and ownership between sources of income i dont think all individuals can be neatly put on either side though since a large portion of small business owners get most of their income from their own labor too the poorer workers who have a side hustle arent the part of the bourgeois class that is actively undermining venezuelas political system so stating the difference can be important
socialism,not_removed,hide for years while having un and other international bodies monitor and compliment how transparent the process is while your gdp and human development index dramatically rose while closing the income gap yeah probably from your ivory tower you are writing this
socialism,not_removed,yet they still live objectively better then cuba you think people dont starve in cuba that people dont get stressed suicide rate may be higher but overall death due to disease or nonnatural factors are lower im just curious why you think its better to live in cuba then say spain or say france where theyve become increasingly more socialist as evidence by higher taxes like frances millionaire tax more redistribution policies and government as a portion of gdp and family life and such are much stronger there in frances case theyre over half of the economy and growing i wouldnt be surprised if it eventually reached cubas high of its right now and france is only a bit away at while the opposite is happening in cuba with more private businesses being allowed to set up if anything it appears like theyre both going in the opposite direction
socialism,not_removed,i wasnt meaning to imply that you thought that i just meant that in response to your question about which govt is doing better than venezuela im sure you can think of examples perhaps i misread you and you mean get into the pisspoor state of affairs in venezuela but i took it to mean get into which govts have done better not trying to make fun of you so sorry if it came across that way
socialism,not_removed,you guys are dogmatic you just defend anyone that sais that support left polices you guys know nothing about venezuela and still defend a goverment thats rejected by at least of venezuelans how many of those index were calculated with and irrealistic exchange rate given by the venezuelan goverment do you even know how is the unemployment rate calculated in venezuela the only reason this country didnt colapse many years ago is because the goverment had a huge income due oil prices to sustaing their autodestructive polices
socialism,not_removed,lecturing latin america from the comfort of your armchair phew i almost took this sub seriously for a second
socialism,not_removed,why are socdems so common this sub isnt for you have you seen the artwork fuck france fuck spain fuck sweden theyre imperialist nations and their goverments are full of war criminals who deserve to be locked away for their crimes
socialism,not_removed,huh didnt realise you were the same person calling someone an asshole and telling them to go fuck themselves just because they called your position on a specific topic unreasonable is a childish thing to do you are putting bullshit words in my mouth how am i putting bullshit words in your mouth you literally called them an asshole and told them to go fuck themself your reason for this was that they called the opinions expressed in this thread up to that point unreasonable not even being obtuse i cant at all see how you could feel i misrepresented you
socialism,not_removed,oh look another regular from rvzla
socialism,not_removed,did you just delete all of your comments from both threads where you look bad or were they removed by someone else
socialism,not_removed,where you look bad lol fuck off smug asshole still trying to insult me and make me feel bad eh too smug to offer analysis but you dont mind trying to belittle someone
socialism,not_removed,why are you so relentlessly abusive you seem to take any disagreement as a personal insult and at the same time viciously disagree with other people all ive done is offer specific criticism of your viewpoints in contrast at every turn youve insulted me and others im really not trying to make you feel bad at all you accuse me of belittling you just because ive criticised your viewpoints and conduct if you want to be an advocate for radical political viewpoints in a public forum then youre going to need a bit of a thicker skin than to take any criticism of your actions or views so hard do you not see the hypocrisy in insulting me various times calling me an advocate the policies that are responsible for millions of deaths when i did no such thing then accusing me of being the one belittling and misrepresenting you
socialism,not_removed,lol disagreeing making fun of ok but apparently im a dishonest gaslighting asshole shitbag smugfuck woah this your comment that started this chain that is what you are doing when you suggest that venezuelans return to neoliberal policies that are responsible for millions of death in the global south isnt it what i said calling me an advocate of policies that are responsible for millions of deaths lol didnt do that in any way shape or form you are dishonest which is part of the reason why it is nice to call you an asshole you dishonest gaslighting shitbag i literally quoted what you said to me what is your problem
socialism,not_removed,ol disagreeing making fun of ok gaslight not what happened but apparently im a dishonest gaslighting asshole shitbag smugfuck persistent too i literally quoted what you said to me i asked you a question you flipped out and started acting like an asshole gonna block you if you dont fuck off already you just keep lying and insulting me what is your problem you fuck off
socialism,not_removed,i asked you a question you flipped out and started acting like an asshole i cant even understand how this is how you can characterise this conversation hahaha you just keep lying and insulting me how am i even lying though you accuse me of lying but when i quoted the exact words you used to describe my position in the post that started the whole conversation you said you didnt do that in any shape or form do you interpret anyone who disagrees with how you feel as gaslighting i honestly cant get my head around how youre seeing this conversation where youve been much much more insulting to me than i have to you and all my arguments against you have come directly from the words you have used against me and other usually quoted verbatim and in context just giving you the benefit of the doubt can you point out how ive been dishonest to you in any way because i dont see it
socialism,not_removed,your post that is what you are doing when you suggest that venezuelans return to neoliberal policies that are responsible for millions of death in the global south my summary of your post do you not see the hypocrisy in insulting me various times and calling me an advocate for policies that are responsible for millions of deaths when i did no such thing wheres the misrepresentation its like what you said to me in full context seriously when in this whole discussion have i misrepresented anything youve said edit post deleted and a pm entitled fuck off what a distasteful person
socialism,not_removed,the socialist not social democratic leftgreen movement also became the second largest party and the communist party tripled its support compared to the last election from to in my opinion thats better news than that the only somewhat leftwing pirate party triples its seats its still good news but the icelandic pirate party really isnt very leftwing other than when it comes to a few specific things im still really hoping that the pirate party and the leftgreens will be able to form a government with some of the smaller leftwing parties though
socialism,not_removed,pp isnt remotely left wing except on a couple of issues indeed bjs intellectual inspiration is a cyberlibertarian
socialism,not_removed,pp is unique i think this is more good than bad but not ideal
socialism,not_removed,so archliberals trippled their seats what has this to do with socialism
socialism,not_removed,intellectual property is a huge issue and i applaud these guys
socialism,not_removed,looks like they may try for a fiveparty coalition that will include socialists social democrats social liberals and classical liberals cant wait to see how thats gonna work
socialism,not_removed,the socialist not social democratic leftgreen movement i had some trouble finding information on them but based on i see literally nothing that isnt social democrat
socialism,not_removed,if pirates are liberals im a llama
socialism,not_removed,seems more likely now of a three party minority government of the leftgreens bright futurepirates and restoration parties that are supported by bright futurepirates and socdems with their seats from the opposition pirates arent really interested in leading and all parties just want the current government to be out id look towards left green chair katrin jakobsdottir as being the next prime minister shes well liked by all sides of the aisle
socialism,not_removed,yeah i predict that intellectual property is going to be a big battleground on the scale of enclosure in europe a few hundred years ago were seeing the infancy of highly automated personal manufacturing with makerbots those can print circuit boards mold plastic and advanced ones can even use lasers to build with metal powder ive also seen digitalized bioponic systems and expect that we will be able to buy reasonably priced fully automated hydroponic gardens in the near future open source is also slowly eating away at capitalists monopoly over software i wouldnt be surprised that if open source and personalized automated production develop far enough big companies will try to make the government make open licenses illegal and auction off the open source ip rights essentially doing the same thing as the enclosure acts just with information rather than land
socialism,not_removed,the founder of the swedish pirate party is an active ancap
socialism,not_removed,i guess llamas know how to use a computer then to give examples from the icelandic pp specifically helgi hrafn one of the ipps mps actively protested against banning a racist website based on the idea that keeping it up would be preventative and iirc he also threw in some slippery slope and muh freeze peach platitudes with it the ipps program is completely devoid of class analysis besides skin deep liberal platitudes the economics of their mainstream is boiler plate keynesianism in short the mainstream of the party are unusually progressive blairites with a notinsignificant as the example of helgi hrafn shows portion being milquetoast muh freeze peach liberalslolbertarians the most use the ipp might be for the icelandic left is that they really do seem to genuinely care about transparency and freedom of information so while they wouldnt solve the contradictions of capitalism they might expose them
socialism,not_removed,yeah falkvinge is an asshole but they also had socialists and anarchafeminists on their executive committee it was only after a couple of years that their insistence on breaking with the piracy bureau analysis to embrace integrity as the main motivator of most of their political stances that they started becoming a more runofthemill internet freedom but not talking about workers councils type of party
socialism,not_removed,plus they are safe heaven for the nazis in germany httpspitfirelistcomnewsnazisinfiltratinggermanyspirateparty
socialism,not_removed,there are lots of pirate parties friend
socialism,not_removed,still dont think that makes them liberals more like a reaction to liberalism that is not ideologically coherent
socialism,not_removed,i know just saying most of them are really liberal
socialism,not_removed,historically these type of people always went after socialists and communists as soon as they got into power id definitely be worried
socialism,not_removed,is anyone here not afraid of trump eventually cracking down on political opposition because honestly i cant imagine many woudnt be
socialism,not_removed,yes actually he is one reichstag fire away from it
socialism,not_removed,absolutely with bannon in the nsc acting as a political kommissar its just a matter of time first they came for
socialism,not_removed,he doesnt give a shit about anyones political affiliation as long as theyre against him
socialism,not_removed,considering how many students professors and leftists were tortured murdered and never heard from again during the military dictatorship in brazil it scares the crap out of me
socialism,not_removed,yeah especially with all the shameless redbaiting the democrats have been doing since the election which is really really confusing given the fact that putin is not a communist im not sure exactly what trump would or could do to suppress the left in the united states i only hope that the more moderate population takes more notice this time than they did last time
socialism,not_removed,ive been ready to be dragged off to the camps since the day he was elected
socialism,not_removed,id like to know too but i can tell you that yes im certainly afraid
socialism,not_removed,i was afraid of this under the last four us presidents anyone involved in radical politics even if its just talking at a book club has been at risk of being put on a list entrapped in an fbi sting etc it does seem that the risk is higher now mainly because of the post infrastructure in place and the increased implementation of surveillance technology
socialism,not_removed,of course its a concern but a lot of the most effective work we can do such as developing our local proletariat via issue conversations with our neighbors remain safe keep yalls heads on a swivel though as the timing if not the content of the administrations actions are unpredictable
socialism,not_removed,socialists have effectively zero public profile in the us and the word has been propagandized and distorted to such degree that most of trumps base considers obama a socialist so i am really unsure who exactly he would be going after additionally trump hasnt gone after organized labor yet with any of the eos you would think that would be the first action he took if he was committed to dissembling the left its always a good idea to stress privacy everyone ought to perform all vital communications through signal and take steps against doxxing but outside of a particularly blatant reichstag fire its hard to think of what would prompt that crackdown the potential may demonstrations especially in seattle would be a potential trigger especially if highways are blockaded but even so im doubtful
socialism,not_removed,you need the cia on your side to do that trump has a contentious relationship with the cia so i doubt that will happen plus tbh trump is too much of a buffoon to be able to pull off something like that
socialism,not_removed,i was at a couple protests and lots of people had signs with putin and hammer and sickles two people were wearing giant paper mache trump and putin heads with trump being pulled by a fake chain by putin who was dressed to look like stalin that kind of crap annoys the hell out of me granted the protests i was at were led by socialists so i guess i shouldnt be too mad haha
socialism,not_removed,what is putin then
socialism,not_removed,thats definitely true but at this point im just prepared for anything
socialism,not_removed,you assume that the nazis were actually responsible for the fire im of the opinion that it was actually the communist they caught its a golden rule of autocrats to never let an emergency go to waste plus he will have his base all riled up with the propaganda about crimes done by immigrants
socialism,not_removed,since the ussr dissolved hes been a member of mostly conservativecentristneoliberal parties hes currently with httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiunitedrussia
socialism,not_removed,a plutocrat
socialism,not_removed,i guess the only silver lining here is that when so many people are put on a list then the list loses a lot of utility
socialism,not_removed,i fully understand but just saying undue paranoia can sap your will to protest and we need everyone to keep fighting as hard as they can right now not waiting for the other boot to fall
socialism,not_removed,thats my concern right now not that ill be in danger at home but that ill have my skull cracked at a demonstration by a border security agent acting on an illegal executive order
socialism,not_removed,thats interesting i vaguely remember reading about evidence existing that the nazis planned to set the fire have any good links
socialism,not_removed,nonmobile link httpsenwikipediaorgwikiunitedrussia helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
socialism,not_removed,yeah i see what you mean it wasnt my intention spread paranoia or make people afraid i agree that we need everyone at their best right now if we really want to achieve something hopefully more and more people will realize that
socialism,not_removed,i will look to see if i can find anything but my understanding is that there isnt any evidence either way people just suspect the nazis did it because its is what enabled hitler to take full control but nobody really knows for sure
socialism,not_removed,socialism means more democracy it means the people effected by decisions should have a say in those decisions right now some aspects of our society are controlled democratically but many important ones including essentially all private business is controlled by a small group of unelected rich people and they are using that control to benefit themselves just like youd expect anyone to we need stronger democratic control of the state with more democratic management of the overall economy and we need democracy in the workplace all the policies like big government welfare spending programs or workplace regulations are just examples of the kind of policies that people favor when they have that kind of democratic control
socialism,not_removed,it depends on your audience i think its important to get a read on the person first my workplace is mostly upper income white people in scotland i usually point out that the nhs and free tuition are built on socialist principles i also subscribe to richard wolfs democracy at work channel and ask people if they like the idea of having more decision making power at work turns out people are quite receptive my wife is american and though she would not describe herself as a socialist she does gleefully inform her american family and friends of the nhs as well as paid paternity leave and time off i hope that helps ignoring the loaded label of socialism at first is quite useful
socialism,not_removed,expansion of democracy in to the economy
socialism,not_removed,under socialism the people who do the work would get to see all the benefits from it rather than most of the money going to a tiny minority that doesnt produce
socialism,not_removed,its inevitable dude
socialism,not_removed,people talk about freedom well imagine the freedom from being exploited because you have no other choice
socialism,not_removed,i like democracy at work having an incompetent and unfit superior is something most people have had to deal with and thats how i frame it without using socialist terminology i had an extreme conservative agree that collectively he and his team could make much better decisions than just his manager thats not necessarily socialism but its certainly better than nothing people who are the most resistant respond really well to direct analogies in their lives
socialism,not_removed,people having direct control over their workplaces communities and lives
socialism,not_removed,i was going to reference you in my own post but my phone isnt great at multitasking and i couldnt see your username i pretty much say what you do depending on audience
socialism,not_removed,ignoring the loaded label of socialism at first is quite useful i think a good strategy is giving the definition first and then the word ask what they think of workplace democracy collective ownership of capital assets and pay thats closer to what they bring to the company minus costs of materials then tell em theres a term for all that
socialism,not_removed,seems like a poor pitch imo people who are scared andor uninformed regarding socialism will likely see it as a threat lots of this are inevitable but are not good
socialism,not_removed,thank you for sharing this important information the plight of agricultural workers should be of concern to everyone
socialism,not_removed,isnt it telling that there is still no scientific consensus on the causes of ckdnt despite the fact that alone in central america at least people died from it since the year as long as there are enough people willing forced by capitalist social relations to work the fields nothing is done and neither the sugar mills nor the pesticide producers react in any way besides bullshit public relations stunts makes me want to fuck something up
socialism,not_removed,following the history of sugar cane one will find nothing but bloodshed colonialism and disease my family comes from a sugarcane farm in veracruz my father was a child when he worked in the fields he would get up at in the morning and cut sugar cane and fill the trucks he would come home during the burning season covered in black soot then go to school he had no electricity and lived in a home with a dirt floor and would frequently have no soles in his shoes and had to use cardboard these are the kind of conditions that people still live with just to supply the worlds addiction to sugar
socialism,not_removed,death without weeping the violence of everyday life in brazil by nancy scheperhughes
socialism,not_removed,i of course know that conditions are horrible for billions of people on this planet under capitalism in the abstract but its only when i see actual suffering human beings throd under the iron heel of the exploiters that i really get angry and want to do something like right now
socialism,not_removed,yes there are plenty of radical groups in first world countries in the usauk there are plenty of radical leftists in blmmomentum respectively even if they arent explicitly socialist movements if youre looking for explicitly socialistanarchist direct action groups lots of major cities have antifa groups of those tendencies secondly protesting for lgbtq rights is radical in a world where people who arent heterocis still face incredible amounts of discrimination calling civil rights struggles identity politics is mindlessly reductive and liberal we dont live in a postrace postgender postsex postclass postidentity world and socialism thrives on pointing out and countering the exploitation that people in those minority groups suffer from
socialism,not_removed,what do you think radical practice even is if left wing groups dont fight for improvements in peoples lives then they are never going to build any sort of revolutionary tendency plus fighting for things like lgtbia rights is just the decent thing to do of course a maoist group wants lgbt rights now dont you or do you not care about freedom
socialism,not_removed,good on you for putting out a good comment im trying to get over their incredibly ironic complaints and not my problem entitlement
socialism,not_removed,blm isnt revolutionary and as far as lgbt rights its shouldnt be a top priority for so called radical groups
socialism,not_removed,i cant speak for most of the eu but syriza isnt a farleft group its a centreleftfarleft coalition they formed a government with anel a right wing populist party thats not far off from ukip or the american tea party groups there are definitely still radical left elements but plenty of them are either in the fairly ineffective nonmodern old guard parties like kke in greece or in looser anarchistsocialist groups organising students and protesting fascists which are also more present than they used to be
socialism,not_removed,you said radical not revolutionary and blm is absolutely radical it calls for the universal right to unionisation release of political prisoners universal democratic control of education universal healthcare and education and decriminalisation of drug crimes and sex work those are all pretty radical and as far as lgbt rights its shouldnt be a top priority for so called radical groups thats just an asshole thing to say uplifting marginalised groups should always be a priority for anyone on the far left even if you dont have an ounce of empathy theres utility in working intrersectionally people from marginalised groups are more likely to sympathise with the overall class struggle having lived in oppression lgbtq people are our natural allies and even those oppressed people who dont subscribe to leftist politics are victims who we should stand in solidarity with im not really sure if youre posting in good faith or trolling at this point but if its the former you might want to do some more reading and thinking
socialism,not_removed,my life expectancy is about to drop
socialism,not_removed,but but he held a rainbow flag once s
socialism,not_removed,it is extremely infuriating that wealthy lgbt people caitlynn jenner being one of the most well known but there are others supported this man knowing that they wouldnt have to deal with his bigotry when he came to office now the rest of us who are poor and working class have to deal with it
socialism,not_removed,im sorry that this is happening we are with you friend and have your back
socialism,not_removed,as a fellow member of the lgbt im definitely by your side comrade ✊
socialism,not_removed,plz no
socialism,not_removed,i actually think this one would be the tipping point to start riots and a storm on the white house
socialism,not_removed,lol no theyll act upset for a while and then lose interest once they remember their six figure jobs and nyc brownstones arent threatened
socialism,not_removed,dude lets give him a chance s
socialism,not_removed,relevant altright comments and
socialism,not_removed,we are all accelerationists now
socialism,not_removed,yeah accelerationism must seem pretty appealing from the point of view of someone whos guaranteed to come out the other end just fine
socialism,not_removed,if this happens it will be even more dangerous for people like me to simply walk around outside
socialism,not_removed,trumptrds should probably remove that before your comment get removed
socialism,not_removed,thanks comrade
socialism,not_removed,oh mines just gonna drop because healthcare but yea that too
socialism,not_removed,time for a good ol
socialism,not_removed,youre right but i will say that among neolibs its trendy to have a diverse group of oppressors oppressing another diverse group they might get angry about that not happening
socialism,not_removed,bingo i was at a really fancy restaurant for my moms birthday the night the immigration ban got announced i think looking around and seeing a bunch of rich liberals who clearly were having a great time the only thing i could think was of course they dont fucking care why would they have to worry selfish fucking people being aloof and being selfish what the fuck else do you expect
socialism,not_removed,how do you get the s so high and to the right
socialism,not_removed,i think accelerationism generally doesnt work but the current political consciousness is uniquely responsive to it
socialism,not_removed,some folks need a silver lining
socialism,not_removed,is that a mecha in the background
socialism,not_removed,just write many times without space obviously seizethemeansofproduction
socialism,not_removed,yeah its from macross
socialism,not_removed,she followed me on twitter so naturally i looked into her campaign and needless to say i might join psl
socialism,not_removed,glorias great i really hope she does well
socialism,not_removed,jesus youre so im not going to insult your narrowmindedness but think outside the goddamned box im dating a woman right now who shares my societal view with regard to socialism she is very smart and went hard in school she became a doctor which fyi is not a mindless soul crushing drone job she has rich clients bourgeois capitalists whom she charges an arm and a leg for services with that money of which there is a fucking lot she doesnt drive a shiny red car and buy a new smartphone every two months she volunteers and liberates that money from capitalists to do what she believes in she offers her medical expertise to a kind of roving bus that drives through marginalized communities and treats those with illness she doesnt have a massive mcmansion she brought a small farm and a lot of land she is simplifying her life and will most definitely retire early and fuck off from society completely except to volunteer her medical expertise sooner than later so my point is that just because you get educated and obtain valuable skills doesnt make you a bourgeois dickhead you can play the game your way stop thinking so small its a waste of time
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately you cant escape capitalism just live your life the way you want to live fuck ethical consumerism and lifestylism do your own thing
socialism,not_removed,some comments consumer culture under capitalism is shit for several reasons yes but that doesnt mean that wantinghaving goods for your personal use is somehow bad to the contrary a healthy and long life isnt possible without high technology and everything that is needed for it including at least some division of labor and use of natural resources diy and small scale agricultural production will get you only so far what if you contract a desease and need medication what if you are interested in astronomy and need a telescope you cant macgyver that stuff up its generally not useful to moralize on and on about egocentric greed souleating society etc thats the kind of talk you can hear coming out of everyones mouths from hippies to evangelical protestants in fact these complaints are bourgeois ideology which doesnt look at the actual social relations and material conditions of people but throws moral demands into their faces as if their thoughts and behavior are somehow devided from the historic conditions of the societies they must exist in work on building up a theoretical understanding of current social conditions in order to develop a critique that is not based on demanding the impossible from people but on reality just for example it will get you nowhere to tell some workers that them buying cheap entertainment electronics from china makes them consumerist pigs what you should do is try to understand why the workers buy this stuff a httpsenwikipediaorgwikicultureindustry that conditions people from childhood to be passive consumers of products that reinforce the ruling ideology that is constructed to produce masses of workers who wont ask questionsdo stuff that might subvert the current system very few resources for high cultureself actualization due to need to distract themselves from their httpwwwworldsocialismorgspgbeducationstudyguidesalienationcapitalistsociety when you have a better understanding why people act as they do you will feel less moral indignation at them and a much stronger drive to change the conditions that produce their behavior thats what marx meant when he said to be radical is to grasp things by the root but for man the root is man himself to become radical and advance your theory of late capitalist society you could start with these works manifesto of the communist party by karl marx and friedrich engels introduction to marxist economic theory by ernest mandel socialism utopian and scientific by friedrich engels god and the state by bakunin imperialism the highest stage of capitalism by vladimir lenin world revolution and communist tactics by a pannekoek reform or revolution by rosa luxemburg critique of the gotha program by karl marx capital by karl marx being against the conditions in todays society is very understandable and a humane stance to take but thats not the same as being antisocial a tendency you seem to express with these words i have no intention in taking part if your goal is to have another society which is more harmonious as you put it you cant achieve that by stepping aside and uselessly trying to absent yourself nothing much will be gained by that at all besides your own suffering while your potential to add your own activity towards a transformation of current conditions is mostly lost work on getting organized the single individual alone will never decisively change conditions in society even people who have been made into demons of world historic energy by bourgeois historians like hitler stalin or on a much lower level lee h oswald had a very limited impact if you consider that they were always part of the societies that produced them and couldve been replaced by literally millions of other people with a similar background they were character masks or in oswalds case he shot a character mask that was replaced by the next one if you have a better understanding of society you have to get together with other people who have similar views you have to organize yourself in order to achieve your goals if you have taken these two steps you might be able to finally take some action according to your and your organizations understanding of good ways to change society taking these three steps theory organization practice might even in time answer your question about jobs that are ok to take under capitalism if you have further questions feel free to ask
socialism,not_removed,id say dont sweat it right now im and finally looking into school something that doesnt exist solely to make money as almost everyone has said youre only lots can change in a couple years dont do anything youre not interested in doing especially college just learn how your life works and youll find a spot in the revolution
socialism,not_removed,i know it seems like shits getting serious now but i was just a few years ago try and relax i wish i had a little more when i was now im old kick back with your friends and smoke a doob have some beers and light up the fire pit unfortunately capitalism cant be avoided or escaped but you can work within the system to help the world for instance im an urban planner i get to do social justice community outreach distributive justice and make my city wonderful but seriously youre and the world seems like shit is when i became a devout nihilist kids are fucking mean highschool is irrelevant and you should just enjoy the only time in your life where you wont have to work for your food
socialism,not_removed,dont get into student loan debt its a trap if you want a job id recommend a tradea union job if you want to be an exworker go read some crimethinc and please dont go train hopping without someone who knows what theyre doing try to find like minded people life can be tough and its good to have friends who know where youre coming from
socialism,not_removed,keep your study and good work revolution need knowledge and new boolds we socialists are not some kind of liberals who just complain and no action our goal of study is to break the chain of capitalism and embrass humanity
socialism,not_removed,if youre truly and this is the kind of class consciousness you developed well just keep on going the same way you did up to now to be honest im impressed try to aim for college in germany holland denmark canada or so most have degrees in english an experience abroad will give you better perspective learn a different language and culture itll do more of the same above do not give up yes this system is rotten and as cohen said everybody knows that the dice are loaded everybody rolls with their fingers crossed but i have faith in a fucker like you that can say something like that at youll find a way even if i cannot think of one for you dont give up
socialism,not_removed,you could go into academia and become a scientist
socialism,not_removed,not everything is capitalism if you dont want a soul crushing mindless job get qualified as a doctor or a scientist or train as a firefighter or an animal rescue worker choose a social role that does some good being selfless and progressive isnt about growing your own fucking fruit or making your own clothes its about doing things to materially improve the lives of the people around you the only way to fight capitalism is to not give in to it of course it will force you to make money to live off of but if your main motivation for being a socialist is because you hate the idea of working youre not a socialist volunteer organise write for a socialist blog join a socialist political party fight the good fight edit also fuck making your parents proud do what you want to do theres no other option
socialism,not_removed,ill just add my two cents in here coz you remind me a bit of how i was way back its easy to get pretty fricking pissed at how things are and for good reason its not easy to go against something as huge as capitalism and it can be especially frustrating when it seems as if you cannot escape this system that this system is unfair unjust and must end but just cause you realize all this which is really good as not a lot of people do at your age doesnt give you license to say fuck it im through when you have barely experienced you life nor waste your potential as a person it would be like saying the capitalists have won at this time in life you have to start small i know you want to rebel but remember that revolution is not built in spirit alone hone your intellect do well in school think of all the famous socialists we know they didnt get there without intellect they also didnt get there alone in your own life start by discussing socialist ideas you dont have to be overt but getting people to see our side helps in the long term of socialism above all dont be selfish and say you have nothing to do with it we are all part of the system which is why we should strive towards making it better for us all and by doing that quite frankly i think it would make your parents proud thats really all i have to say just take care
socialism,not_removed,as someone else said you cant escape capitalism also you probably shouldnt bother with college its not really worth it anymore
socialism,not_removed,dont go to college take it from someone who was in the middle of college in the economic collapse couldnt get a job after graduation and is forced to be debt slave try to get education in the form of a trade school or an apprenticeship seriously learn a skill that way and youll be an enormous asset to any socialist movement and stay active politically join a union were stuck with capitalism until we can over throw it and theres no shame in taking what you can from the system in order to destroy it its not your friend as youve come to realize and take a breather in the process youre only
socialism,not_removed,to kind of summarize for you op we need socialists in positions of power acting ethically within capitalism im close to finished with college and im damn glad that i went because its given me the tools to be proactive and think critically about my actions in the pursuit of a better future for everyone edit and individualist moralizing is selfdefeating you cant effect collective change by trying to put yourself outside of the system because it will go on fucking everyone else while you gloat
socialism,not_removed,contribute to a system i fucking hate because it allows me to do my thing how selfless and progressive
socialism,not_removed,its funny you took that path i did psychology at undergrad then it at masters my dissertation was on natural language processing im interested in the idea of capitalism progressing technology to such a degree that it renders itself redundant i would add to your last sentence by saying do the right thing all the time happiness is a natural result of that
socialism,not_removed,my wife is of the opinion that its better for young people to work for a few years and then go to school by that time you will have a better understanding of what its like in the dung heap you will have matured and may have a better idea of how you want to expend your resources
socialism,not_removed,im and leaving the military in the next two months goddamn torturous slog through an imperial fucktonne of the most virulently rightwing garbage youve ever seen to go to college pulling disability for fucking up my back and utterly obliterating the cartilage in my knees going to college on the governments dime going to do what makes me happy and gives me the time to go out and be an actual activist instead of just weekend warrioring my advice to the op is summed up simply as do you do what makes you happy do what good you can life is too short to spend it endlessly navelgazing
socialism,not_removed,i went back to college and have more debt now but the way i see it the debt bubble will have to collapse at some point soon it just cannot go on like this and in the meantime i am learning a lot im doing plant biology this time around and am thinking about starting a cooperative greenhouse or hydroponics lab
socialism,not_removed,rstudentloandefaulters
socialism,not_removed,you cant escape capitalism but you can always organize and try to abolish it
socialism,not_removed,when you say contribute what do you mean really when you work a job and are exploited you produce something that probably has value to whoever consumes it and youre more productive than if you worked alone the problem with capitalism is that it distorts the allocation of work and the distribution of commodities and surplus your employer steals from you and the economy as a whole produces a set of goods and services that doesnt optimally track what people really want or need the problem with slavery wasnt the production of cotton or the wearing of clothes it was the slavery likewise the problem with capitalism isnt producing or consuming things the problem is the lack of control it affords most everyone over their own lives and society its a parasite — dont slay the host to get rid of it dont abandon your right to take part in society because private power perverts it to its own needs in a more practical sense consider working for or starting a cooperativeworker owned business its a step in the right direction if you dont play this game you can still lose all the same
socialism,not_removed,agreed thats exactly how i feel which is why ive waited for a few years
socialism,not_removed,you do mean gazing at bellybuttons i hope
socialism,not_removed,rstudentloandefaulters
socialism,not_removed,yeah no i only realized that wow i had the wrong phrase there lifes too short to waste it all on oh god what am i gonna do dont reddit and jagerbomb boys and girls
socialism,not_removed,d
socialism,not_removed,but but thats my favourite way to reddit see you over at rdrunk
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,completely fucking ignored by mainstream media god damnit
socialism,not_removed,fortunately people dont seem to be waiting for them
socialism,not_removed,the democrats are fucking useless anyway
socialism,not_removed,the cuban land reforms under che destroyed the bourgeoisies rule of the land and redistributed it to the peasant working class cooperatives and the state fidel castro himself ended up expropriating his own land as he was actually originally a member of the bourgeoisie now thats impressive
socialism,not_removed,does it have to be leftists because i have a damn good example of land reform the inclosure acts in great britain theres a wikipedia srticle about them no link because on phone after the capitalists took government power they looked out and saw that many instances of the commons still existed they were a postfeudal artifact so capitalists took it they divvied up the land fenced it off and sold it to the highest bidder sending huge swathes of population who had lived and worked communally into the cities to work so they could afford new homes you may find this a familiar story if youve listened to comrade jake the dog in effect they made mass wagelabor possible by driving down the cost of wages the bourgeoisie enriching themselves at the cost of the poor in the most overt form statesponsored theft of their livelihoods and redistribution on the grounds of money
socialism,not_removed,pshh i was hoping for some hardcore pressure hose action
socialism,not_removed,oh look this one is even better httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvspecsegbsy
socialism,not_removed,rejoice
socialism,not_removed,so what youre saying is that we should all become firefighters
socialism,not_removed,a reminder that the fascists arent the only ones with great big hoses
socialism,not_removed,what country is this
socialism,not_removed,small victories are still victories
socialism,not_removed,these guys work together in most cases theyre practically colleagues it would be pretty shitty to do anything hardcore
socialism,not_removed,commie points to whoever thought that one up
socialism,not_removed,the back of their clothing says hasselt which is a city in belgium
socialism,not_removed,belgium
socialism,not_removed,the only victory is a revolutionary one youre a reformist
socialism,not_removed,spoken like a real trot
socialism,not_removed,the political relationship between the cops and firefighters is different from country to country mostly depending on the ratio of volunteer to professional firefighters volunteer firefighters are scab labourers in almost every case being brought in to undercut the wages and conditions of the professionals in countries like chile the firefighters are percent volunteer and as a result are politically rightwing during the coup they openly aided the military by blocking off roads and attacking leftists but that is not the case everywhere in other countries such as australia the firefighters are highly professionalized and working class with high levels of union membership i dont particularly know the case in belgium where this was filmed but i dont think that in most countries there would be any particular barrier to building a militant firefighters union willing to take on the cops other than the politics of reformism and the political bankruptcy of todays union bureaucrats
socialism,not_removed,enjoy your misting of justice coppers
socialism,not_removed,youre a reformist i dont dispute your first point i hope you are joking with the reformist thing because it is just slander
socialism,not_removed,youre comrade
socialism,not_removed,muh transitional programme muh proles too stupid to self organise and need the vanguard
socialism,not_removed,only a sith deals in absolutes wait i mean fuck
socialism,not_removed,ive never seen volunteer firefighters called scabs before in canada theyre what we have in tiny communities and rural areas that dont have the money to pave roads let alone have a professional standing fire brigade
socialism,not_removed,as a belgian this is what i know belgian firemen are mostly volunteers with about professionnals they are heavily unionized nonetheless because thats belgium to you if you are employed by the government you are unionized they are also organized in a federation the federation approves recent changes in firemen status some union members dont even though unions were involved in the discussion for the changes strikes are a national pastime this is how you talk to the government this isnt a response to an overly outrageous situation where people are ready to fight and lose a lot this isnt about toppling the whole system this is simply putting pressure put on the government in the end people will talk and a compromise will be reached cops and firemen encounter and help each other all the time they cant be too shitty to each other this being said firemen charged cops cops used pepper spray and batons and both sides used water cannons before they all settled down
socialism,not_removed,transitional programme is reformism
socialism,not_removed,its just too easy here trots are so sensitive
socialism,not_removed,here are volunteer firefighters in victoria australia rallying against the bargaining power of the united firefighters union i think the term volunteer can be a bit misleading volunteer firefighting is almost always a paid job parttime and sometimes fulltime just at much lower wage than their professional counterpart their whole existence is reliant upon the undercutting of wages and conditions for professionals if they werent paid less have shittier working conditions and have no benefits whatsoever they wouldnt exist at all the state has the capital to pay for a fully professional firefighting force its just not in their interests instead they cry poor and pray upon the civic duty and sense of community of ordinary workers in order to con them into taking shit pay and conditions below industry standard
socialism,not_removed,still confused what in me celebrating some funny working class militancy was an affirmation of a transitional programme this just makes you seem like a crazed sectarian grasping at straws
socialism,not_removed,not sensitive just really struggling to understand what angle you are going for here
socialism,not_removed,a crazed sectarian this i am
socialism,not_removed,small victories reforms transitional programme is reformist i worked with cwi for a few months once and they are embarrassing no one gives a fuck or reads those news papers get with the times also the cwi were money grubbing bastards and its ran almost like a business fuck the paid organiser positions
socialism,not_removed,undoubtedly
socialism,not_removed,okay i am not a member of a cwi organization socialist alternative in australia has nothing to do with socialist alternative in the us and never have been cannot believe something as simple as celebrating an iota of working class militancy has generated this type of nonsense
socialism,not_removed,i am not a member of a cwi organization socialist alternative in australia has nothing to do with socialist alternative in the us and never have been i know but youre both trots out of curiosity since its often trots whinging about left unity or something why dont all the different trot orgs join together why isnt aussiesocalt part of cwi for example
socialism,not_removed,the cwi affiliate in australia is the socialist party which is a tiny sect of less than a hundred people with a precense only in melbourne that recently had half of its membership split over allegations that the leadership covered up the sexual assault of a female member they spend most of their time campaigning in irrelevant council elections that they cannot win and have an extremely conservative stance towards fascism which largely consists of holding picnics instead of participating in rallies that confront the growing fascist movement in australia as for left unity we have merged with other organizations but only on a principled basis of shared agreement around revolutionary socialist principles unity of the left for the sake of unity is moronic
socialism,not_removed,am american sadly can confirm this is too many people
socialism,not_removed,this is great and very accurate
socialism,not_removed,not every american
socialism,not_removed,why did it squeeze in that they agree that socialism is dirty
socialism,not_removed,its sad at how idiotic the average right wing american is every place has idiots but ive never been to any other country with such a problem
socialism,not_removed,more like against the american right
socialism,not_removed,as an american i just want to chime in that most of us just want to be left alone and have system where everyone gets out what they put in
socialism,not_removed,nationalised healthcare isnt necessarily socialism
socialism,not_removed,as an murican i approve this message were all doomed doomed i say doomed
socialism,not_removed,actually reminds me of sam harris
socialism,not_removed,where does this freedom from religion stuff come from we never covered that in con law we covered freedom of expression freedom of assembly free exercise and the anti establishment clause but not freedom from that would be ridiculous that would imply being free to discriminate against religious hires who might observe a holiday and would infringe peoples freedom of expression if it exposes you to religious ideas it would imply employers not needing to give religious accommodations it would imply a prohibition from learning about foreign cultures and religions in public school humanities courses all of that is obviously wrong the anti establishment clause is far more mundane its really only preventing america from establishing a state religion avoiding excessive entanglement and allocating tax dollars to purely religious endeavors in very specific circumstances
socialism,not_removed,why am i still here
socialism,not_removed,you need to move i live in boston and if i didnt have the internet and tv i would never believe that people who even believe half of the stuff existed i barely even know anyone who isnt an atheist
socialism,not_removed,dont worry comrade well make sure to put them out of their misery soon enough
socialism,not_removed,i thought he was agreeing about the bit on believing in the constitution rather than the socialism thing
socialism,not_removed,cuz its actually a liberal meme not a socialist one surprised to see it upvoted in rsocialism tbh im pretty sure a seized version has been upvoted in rfullcommunism before
socialism,not_removed,europe isnt fairing much better fascism is on the rise there nows a good time to begin the revolution in earnest bash them all to the grave
socialism,not_removed,i appreciate the offer but i like it here and refuse to be run off by a bunch of fascist dorks
socialism,not_removed,its an inherent feature of the system now the right embraced the idiot vote because they can be led easier by appealing to their emotions theyve further cultivated it by demonizing the educated as ivory tower elites and cutting funding for public education
socialism,not_removed,no the comic strawmanned nine times so it all cancels out and makes it not fallacious
socialism,not_removed,police socialist
socialism,not_removed,ive lived virtually everywhere except the east coast in america and its a pretty universal thing honestly chances are either you live in a progressive area or the people youve gotten close with are people similar to younonsimilar to the comic main reason i meet these people is i live in the country atm and when you have to meet your girlfriends family they almost always are very conservative and religious out here otherwise its pretty easy to never find people like this if you dont get close with people who arent similar to yourself
socialism,not_removed,this is one big strawman kind of disappointed actually
socialism,not_removed,how
socialism,not_removed,if youre not familiar with boston its known as one of the most progressive places in the usa
socialism,not_removed,theres no negotiating with reactionaries or fascists history has shown us that
socialism,not_removed,theres so little difference between le pen and fillon its laughable france is turning reactionary anyway
socialism,not_removed,a weak or imaginary opposition as an argument or adversary set up only to be easily confuted
socialism,not_removed,what where you before you were a socialist
socialism,not_removed,how is that what this is thats what im asking
socialism,not_removed,this is true the only difference between a le pen or fillon win would be who is emboldened by it fascists or bourgeoispetit bourgeois reactionaries in any case minorities and the working class are in trouble
socialism,not_removed,because its a weak imaginary adversary set up only to be easily confuted
socialism,not_removed,it looks pretty spot on to me explain how its wrong
socialism,not_removed,commercialized and unaccountable this entire section is on point for today i learned the lesson of this articles section the hard way through my experience with democratic party leadership and their donor class abandon the democratic party but steal their base
socialism,not_removed,at this point there is no hope in reforming the dems might as well get behind the green party or an explicitly marxist one like the party for socialism and liberation
socialism,not_removed,in an anarchist society which i advocate there is no state everything that produces the stuff we need ie factories farms and so on are owned by working people as a whole from each according to their ability to each according to their need workplaces would be democratic yes that is to say workers in any given factory would decide whats produced how much they should produce and so on problems can be directly addressed by said workers through discussions and they can solve them quicker and more efficiently than any boss because they have more intimate knowledge of what actually goes into making shit the example i usually point to is during the spanish civil war workers and peasants in catalonia aragon andalusia and parts of the levante collectivized workplaces and farms this resulted in doubled industrial and agricultural production throughout the regions
socialism,not_removed,you would most likely still have managerssupervisors in the workplace but they would function differently than they do in our current system their goal in a socialist system would be to support the workers and assist them rather than support shareholders
socialism,not_removed,a good place to start is by researching about there are hundreds of them out there already edit this is another article about httpswwwthenationcomarticleworkercooperativesaremoreproductivethannormalcompanies
socialism,not_removed,httpwwwthenextsystemorgeconomicdemocracy
socialism,not_removed,i would like to point out that capitalist societies end up with authoritarian regimes regularly in fact prominent capitalists often push for authoritarians that oppress socialists and other groups that threaten their property and dominance
socialism,not_removed,look at currently existing workerowned cooperatives like mondragon and winco foods jobs are created by workers are there any minor examples of socialism appearing in a smaller scale rojava the ezln in chiapas revolutionary catalonia etc
socialism,not_removed,since there arent any real examples of socialism how do we know this would work there are were real examples of socialism and they worked very well antirevisionist marxismleninism and marxismleninismmaoism hold that the soviet union before the and the peoples republic of china until the late were socialist there have been other socialist states as well but these are the big ones catalonia in the spanish civil war for instance was a socialist state ie the proletariat organized as the ruling class suppressed the bourgeoisie this is what marxists mean by a state your questions are better suited for a dedicated sub for newcomers to socialism and communism like for marxism specifically
socialism,not_removed,okay all of the examples in this thread are good to kind of get a general idea of what socialism will be like but the reality is that we can not really imagine what socialism will be like just like a peasant in the century couldnt possibly imagine selling his work for money and not living of his land since how the things are and how society is organized shapes what we can imagine there is no way to really describe how it will be since we even lack the words to describe it that doenst mean that there is no personal utopia that people need to fight for socialism it just means that we cant really now except communal ownership of the means of production
socialism,not_removed,apologies if this is a tad to long nice to see you talking an interest in socialism take it slow first coz it is easy to get overwhelmed with a lot of the technical sides of socialism there are also many different views as to how a socialist societyeconomy should be run so ill try to run through the basics first and then try to address your questions socialism can best be thought of as a different way of running economies as it appeared in response to capitalism and is characterized primarily with the social ownership and democratic control of the means of production now what that means is that instead of the normal capitalist method of where the ceo for instances owns all the capital or the means of production and then pays their worker wages socialists argue in favor of a collective ownership of those means of production wherein the workers can more directly profit from their work without a ceo looking down at them and dictating their wage for instance in this manner a socialist business would allow workers to more directly profit from their work as well as without alienating them from the fruit of their labour and finally allow people to truly work for what they want without worrying about the threat of being fired or not having enough money for rent that is the basic idea of socialism there are however many different ways we can achieve this and that is why there are many different kinds of socialist the two main strands of socialism is basically between the more statist marxistleninism which argues that socialism can be achieved via the state so where you get your idea of nationalization where the state owns the business or industry etc or the more anarchist anarcocommunist or socialist which argues against the use of the state and instead more not state owned business but still cooperative with the means of production in the hands of the workers so for your question the correct answer would be yes and no depending on how you think socialism can be achieved for the question yes workers may have a leader of sorts but they are democratically elected and are still part of the workers for questions and we have had examples of socialism in the past the best example would be httpsenwikipediaorgwikirevolutionarycatalonia so we know in some sense what we can achieve in terms of whether or not we know if it will work i think think the real problem is that it has never been allowed to work every time we end up succeeding like say in catalonia we are destroyed by either capitalists or fascists or both in more recent time however for a success story of socialism is bolivia which was mostly brought about by who managed to take one of the poorest nations in south america and caused unprecedented macroeconomic strength resulting in the increase in value of its currency the boliviano his first year in office ended with no fiscal deficit the first time this had happened in bolivia for years while during the global financial crisis of – it maintained some of the worlds highest levels of economic growth now in terms of socialism at the smaller scale one example would be worker owned cooperatives and the like for the question this would really be a matter of politics rather than economics as it is tied to the question of how will we bring about socialism in my personal view the only real way we can prevent authoritarian regimes would be through democratic means of government as though it has many failings it is the only for of government that can vote a dictator out or well rally the people to get rid of them ie impeachment i hope this answers most of your questions if you have any more feel free to ask also if i have made any mistakes please inform me so that i can make the corrections have a nice day comrade
socialism,not_removed,if youre interested in smallscale examples of socialism and anarchism check out the book two cheers for anarchism by jc scott
socialism,not_removed,thanks for the response are you saying that the things produced in an anarchist society would be distributed by the people can people be trusted enough to do this on such a large scale why would you choose anarchism over having democratically elected officials handle it
socialism,not_removed,ive seen some numbers state that workers wage dont reflect their true output in a company would a manager need to be paid more if they have more responsibility wont that lead to people at the top earning more just like a capitalistic society or would they take on the extra responsibility without any extra compensation thanks for the response
socialism,not_removed,not necessarily true the socialism i advocate has shareholders they are collective rather than private
socialism,not_removed,what do we do here then and how do we prepare
socialism,not_removed,thanks for the response youve cleared up a lot of confusion i guess i still have a rather basic question in a socialist society capitalism is banned correct what is the real purpose of all the jobs since the main purpose of capitalism revolves around maximizing profits does that mean that the purpose of goods and services produced in a socialist economy is to be redistributed amongst the population
socialism,not_removed,that depends on the workers the workers would democratically control the distribution of wealth accumulated by their labor managers dont necessarily have more responsibilities but rather just have different responsibilities what point would there be to hoard wealth in a socialistcommunist society
socialism,not_removed,not really that it is banned but rather that it is no longer the economic system in place jobs would no longer be about serving profit but rather about serving the people therefore if you want to get to the real true purpose of jobs it would be to provide us meaning and fulfillment in life which is absent from capitalism due to the alienation of the worker from their work you dont see yourself in what you do with the bonus that people all have what they need and can be happy about it in terms of redistribution i think it would depend on the type of socialism we are talking about in more statist you might have something like that while in the more anarchist im not sure if you would have it i think the best why to think about it would be from each according to their ability to each according to their need while we are at it just to clear this up if you are not aware socialists make a big distinction with private property and personal property we are in favor of getting rid of private property while we are completely alright with you keeping your personal property private property can be best thought of as the means of production in a sense your capital so this would be like a factory or a bakery etc personal property includes items intended for personal useeg clothes homes and vehicles and sometimes money it must be gained in a socially fair manner and the owner has a distributive right to exclude others
socialism,not_removed,paging udenversocialists
socialism,not_removed,deleted
socialism,not_removed,hey there im in denver for sure id be happy to meet up some time
socialism,not_removed,heya
socialism,not_removed,radicalizing liberalsprogressives should be preferred over forming coalitions with them
socialism,not_removed,how you get to considering zuckerberg gates and cuban as moderate capitalists i dont get these are people who have done a lot of shady stuff to get as rich as they are they are not our friends
socialism,not_removed,should we or shouldnt we try to build a broad coalition including nonsocialists at least for the next half decade yes but we dont need wealthy capitalists whose agendas are to fill their own pockets we need to reach the millions of disaffected and disengaged working class people of all backgrounds whose lives would benefit most from our ideas
socialism,not_removed,i think we should be reaching out to proletarian and pretty bourgeoisie a là the im not sure if any ultra capitalists would support our movement but yeah we should definitely seek recruit more people dont forget that when france abolished feudalism it had the support of the liberal nobility
socialism,not_removed,i feel like a lot of people here dont necessarily appreciate the value of pragmatism is it important not to compromise our belief system or cede too much ground towards liberalism in the fight against trump absolutely are there enough socialists in the united states to sufficiently hold the trump administration to account not even close politics begin where the masses are as i believe lenin said and there simply arent masses of people in the us who share our views if we steadfastly refuse to engage with liberals we ensure that will continue to be the case whether we compromise our belief system or not is all about the way in which we choose to engage and how we present our opinions choosing to isolate ourselves because were not satisfied with anything short of outright revolution is not an option we do not have the numbers right now and it will take time to get to the point where we do liberals are fucking angry right now just like we are destroying capitalism is a long term goal fighting burgeoning fascism worldwide must be a short term goal if we want that to happen and for that we need liberals
socialism,not_removed,no in allying with the moderate capitalists we would have to compromise our own beliefs to align with theirs and prolong the coalition for its own sake the best course of action from a socialist perspective is to organise and spread movements based around socialist ideas any alliance with reactionaries or the slightly lessreactionary would ultimately lead to postponing any existential threats swiftly followed by the destruction of the socialist element once their own power is cemented and the danger has passed
socialism,not_removed,no
socialism,not_removed,we should reach out to those layers of the oppressed who are not yet socialists and organize them the monarchies of europe prince fucking charles wtf you want to give trump ammunition to fire against us of course we should fight for every democratic right won by the labour movement and others in the past against war and policies to stop climate change we dont abstain from participating in real mass movements just because liberals or people who are not yet socialists are involved however we fight for these things under our own banner and with our own methods we fight to win leadership of that movement in opposition to the liberals who will attempt to limit those movements to working for the democrats or whoever in the next election
socialism,not_removed,yes of course i know its frustrating but we need to rub shoulders with liberals we need to encourage them to get back out onto the streets even when the inevitable fatigue sets in dont forget people are actively looking for ways to get politically involved right now if theres no organization in your area create one invite anyone with righteous indignation within them
socialism,not_removed,while i do believe we should reach out to them i think the main goal of this should be to radicalize them fighting the trump administration together is nice and all but if they dont learn any lessons from it well end up with another neoliberal president and the cycle will start all over again right now there are a lot of liberals who feel powerless and abandoned by the establishment ive even see quite a few moving to the left and becoming interested in socialism this is the moment where we should show them why were in this mess and how it can be solved
socialism,not_removed,gates moderate lobbying for more privatized education and teachers pay being based on students grades no thanks fam zuckerberg moderate selling personal infofacebook tracks all your browsing not just the stuff you do on facebook to corporations and the cia i feel like before we can talk about creating a socialist world in which clintons rshitliberalssay
socialism,not_removed,i do not sip tea with the enemy
socialism,not_removed,deleted
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately the word radicalization has very negative connotations in contemporary usage ie allahu akbar we should use persuade or convert instead
socialism,not_removed,exactly we must trust in our process these efforts have worked before and will work again once we get past the initial inertia
socialism,not_removed,well mao did say a revolution is not a tea party
socialism,not_removed,no because this isnt some debate where we are bringing people to our side socialism is our movement if they cant come to that viewpoint then fuck en
socialism,not_removed,if they cant come to that viewpoint then fuck en and if we cant bring more people to our viewpoint we are fucked
socialism,not_removed,so you better start organizing comrade look up the philly socialists along with antifa and union organizing thats what we need to do you radicalize liberals through socialist organizing projects not through watering down the movement by working with the enemy
socialism,not_removed,you better start organizing yep nothing says organizing like constant nonstop contempt for anyone who doesnt subscribe to your exact model of economic theory combined with slapping down literally any attempt to cooperate against a greater evil
socialism,not_removed,i think we should reach out to anyone who supports the abolition of nationalism tribalism and racism the abolition or nearabolition of capitalism id be willing to tolerate someone who supports small business and sole proprietors raul castro is my hero the adoption of worldwide income redistribution the preservation of a livable biosphere replacing electoral liberal sham democracy with true democracy regardless of pedantic divides now is not the time for how many angels can dance on the head of a pin sophistry
socialism,not_removed,focus on the problems and potential solutions via democracy in the workplace talk about alienation dont make firm policy commitments trump is right about that strategy
socialism,not_removed,i mean that sounds great and all but why are both you the previous poster talking about philadelphia specifically
socialism,not_removed,i dont know tbh im really tired and i just realized why is that person talking about philly specifically so i attempted to delete mine before anyone noticed clearly i have failed hahah
socialism,not_removed,and this is exactly why the left has to step up its communication and propaganda i feel like so many of us are stuck using language from people who died years ago and dont know how to market our ideas to the modern masses i was essentially a socialist for a couple of years before learning what socialism was because all i had heard was liberal bs about the ussr china and something about worker ownership over the means of production the pretentious ivory tower inhabitants say oh but our ideas cant be succinctly expressed even still not every comrade needs to be a dialectical wizard they just have to know capitalism private property is shit and there will be socialism or barbarism we need more memes more artists more musicians more people being open about their political views more public figures more marches more everything our biggest struggle right now is getting people to learn what socialism actually is theres a whole new generation in the us that didnt experience the red scare starting to get interested in politics shit if i search anarchism on instagram i see more pictures of trump from anarchocapitalists than i do red and black flags dont let propertarians and the far right swoop in
socialism,not_removed,i dont think its that they have an easier argument to make although you make a compelling caseh for at they do we can find thousands of cases of capitalism behaving badly this subreddit seems like it is becoming rcapitalismbehavingbadly rather than rsocialism its easy to make the argument that the rich shit on the poor just trot out any piece of information on their greed reactionaries frequently have the advantage of being more amiable to the status quo which gives them the added advantage of wing more accessible i have said it before i think its because the forces of reaction appear to be doing more and in times like these people will side with any solution rather than the right solution its more a sign of desperation
socialism,not_removed,people are turning away from neoliberalism and this is the result but the left is gaining power too look at what sanders achieved calling himself a socialist even though hes not that would have been unthinkable a decade ago corbyn in the uk and across france people protesting in the name of labour rights rojava and the kurds gaining ground even as turkey invades and its deeply distressing to see the right gain power like it seems to be doing but dont forget that a vital tenet of fascism is that the people will be drawn to celebrity not politics if trump loses in november then the movement will mostly collapse thats my opinion on the matter anyway and remember even after the rise of fascism in the and the second world war the far right was defeated and most of the world elected the furthest left governments that they had ever had once the storm has passed the sun will be stronger than ever
socialism,not_removed,the reactionaries have the advantage because they dont have to think about anything and their audience needs absolutely no prior knowledge on any sort of subject thats not really true its just that theyve had centuries of indoctrination into their line of thinking and we are trying to turn that around i honestly dont think that people have in general gotten more reactionary or bigoted its been at such a steady low roar in our culture that if you werent on the receiving end of it it just became an invisible just how it is kind of thing and now were seeing it laid bare for everyone to see
socialism,not_removed,my thoughts the whole way through reading this were of viral staple of reactionary facebook who just released todays edition of two minutes hate this time of course about colin kaepernick and youre very right our politics are in a scary place right now
socialism,not_removed,reactionaries are paper tigers you will never find a mass movement of these people every major popular movement we have seen in the us has been leftwing black lives matter for an example you will never see these internet trolls at a march or strike they just exist to spew their shit and maybe go to the polls to vote for trump
socialism,not_removed,yes i agree we are in some very scary times right now there is definitely a populist rage against the statusquo however the rank and file have basically split off into two factions in one corner are the folks who reject neoliberalism and free markets but believe their current financial woes are more so a result of social liberalism ie too soft on immigration national defense muslims etc as opposed to the liberalization of the economy as a result they are more likely to gravitate towards a strongman outsider like trump who is promising to use the might of the state to crush the enemy and restore their jobs trump gave these folks permission to express their anger towards the weakest members of society who are being portrayed as responsible for their suffering on the other side of the fence are those individuals who also reject the neoliberal agenda but see the root cause of their economic conditions as the billionaire class who control the economy and the politicians and not necessarily the immigrants who are fleeing usbacked dictatorships for a better life in america in their view the solution is clearly to overthrow the oligarchs and return the economy and the political system back to the people i think the reason why the former group is behaving more destructively is simply due to the natural tendency of reactionary ideology to devolve into authoritarianism and eventually fullblown fascism the economic collapse coupled with the establishment greenlighting of corporate financed elections has merely accelerated this process hence the rapid increase in scariness we are seeing currently
socialism,not_removed,capitalism in decay can be very dangerous
socialism,not_removed,they just want simple answers to complex problems common sense is one of the most unfortunate notions that so many conservatives and reactionaries carry with them it can reduce all contrary thoughts to overwrought pretentiousness or degeneracy from the real culture all while keeping its central tenets as unquestionable dogma certainly applies to leftists as well but traditionalists have refined it to the integral feature of the culture
socialism,not_removed,which lbgt video i mightve missed it
socialism,not_removed,more memes more artists more musicians more people being open about their political views more public figures more marches more everything this is the best thing ive heard all day
socialism,not_removed,this post is pretty significant and should be shared quite widely
socialism,not_removed,and remember even after the rise of fascism in the and the second world war the far right was defeated and most of the world elected the furthest left governments that they had ever had while thats true i would rather not have million people die for the left to gain more influence
socialism,not_removed,especially memes they seem to be the most efficient propaganda nowadays commie memes for the meme god
socialism,not_removed,good point lets hope for no world war
socialism,not_removed,ive never seen that video before it was a nice video fuck all the reactionaries who disliked it i bet a lot of people disliked it because they thought agendertransgenderbisexualpansexualetc arent real things
socialism,not_removed,oh my goodness that thread is a cesspool of reactionary liberalism
socialism,not_removed,jesus christ fuck reddit and im not a jill stein fan
socialism,not_removed,i dont think this is going to end well reddit is too conservative or too center right liberals yep people are trashing her in it not surprised edit tbf she is not perfect ugh i am thinking of just writing in chomsky
socialism,not_removed,im being heavily downvoted and called a deplorable for agreeing with ajamu baraka so theres that
socialism,not_removed,pretty depressing how the effects of the ongoing media disinfo campaign are apparent even on rsocialism and disappointing that socialists cant summon the willpower to stand in solidarity with jillajamu no wonder no leftist party can get off the ground in the usa
socialism,not_removed,her stances on gmos wifi and nuclear energy are insane
socialism,not_removed,i love how the only upvoted reply was the one about student debt degrees to the left but only if it benefits them personally fucking liberals
socialism,not_removed,america is so fucked im voting for her because shes at least the only one that isnt a racist or an overt capitalist puppet that thread exposes bare the ideology of the average smug liberal westerner propped up by imperialism its all there defense of wall streetbig banks how renewable energy is bad for the economy bashing ajamu for standing up for ferguson protestors and calling obamathe nobel peace prize drone bomber an uncle tom shilling the false antiscience lie saying that we cant afford to forgive student loan debt defense of the racist police especially their actions against black people and native americans fucking nuclear energy as if theres any reason we cant skip over that entirely sorry the vitriol in that thread against the only moderate leftist in the running shows that fascism is utterly inevitable in america these confrontations between police and native americans and police and black people are only going to rise in the years to come the fact that there is no armed resistance to them and worse that the vast majority of entitled liberal scum supports the police state tells me that fascism will probably win
socialism,not_removed,writing in chomsky will likely spoil your ballot as i recall writing in a candidate who hasnt registered as a writein candidate means your ballot wont be counted but thats only if you care about the rest of your ballot being counted
socialism,not_removed,wasnt johnson praised to the skies last he came around these parts
socialism,not_removed,chomsky is a liberal
socialism,not_removed,so liberals have expanded deplorables from meaning altright racist to anyone who doesnt like hillary clinton
socialism,not_removed,everything that guy was saying about baraka is exactly why ive got a crush on the guy
socialism,not_removed,i asked in a thread on rpoliticaldiscussion why somebody thought he was not a person to be admired at all they gave a list of reasons calling obama an uncle tom calling the republican march after the charlie hebdo attacks a white power march etc i agreed with baraka on a few but didnt feel like receiving a bunch of hate mail again so i just said something like cool ill read more about him basically didnt let them know that i agree with some of his statements while still letting them be able to continue their party circlejerk
socialism,not_removed,uh youre being downvoted for accusing anyone who disagrees with you of belonging to ctr
socialism,not_removed,she needs to stop with the wifi shit and maybe appeal to you know a generation of people who know how the internet works rather than technophobic old hippies
socialism,not_removed,no seriously my mouth dropped open when i read the wifi bit
socialism,not_removed,wifi yes gmo probably but nuclear why not just skip that shit and go straight to windwatersolartidal
socialism,not_removed,i wouldnt call the nuclear thing insane though its wrong whats the matter with her stance on gmos though i dont think shes ever said anything about gmos in general being bad but the modern usage of gmos is oppressive the wifi thing is definitely bad regardless shes just a social democrat that attracts antiscience types conspiracy theorists and the eating local solves all types
socialism,not_removed,honestly i dont think anyone really cares about jill stein but the green party is the only leftwing party that has more than a marginal presence in this election and they have a platform that while not socialist has some good leftwing things in it also third parties in general represent an attempt to challenge the two party oligarchy at least if its from the left libertarian party is a joke ideally the head of gpusa would be a more serious ecosocialistworking class movement leader because stein is pretty bad
socialism,not_removed,because as far as any election goes you are doing lesserevilism math to an extent stein has some shitty views but she is by far better than anything out there right now
socialism,not_removed,i despise the woman as much as i dislike trump i dislike stein more her attempted hijacking of the leftwing movement in the us is terrifying she is the worst kind of political opportunist
socialism,not_removed,ten degrees to the left of center in good times ten degrees to the right of center if it affects them personally phil ochs love me im a liberal
socialism,not_removed,i am deciding between just voting jill just for the propositions i want to vote for
socialism,not_removed,its only for that one position not the ballot as a whole
socialism,not_removed,if i remember correctly he was mostly praised this is one of the few places where any form of socialism is treated seriously sadly or well this is the only place that i know of
socialism,not_removed,citation for why you think this
socialism,not_removed,altright doesnt mean anything anyway so it works
socialism,not_removed,the false flag stuff is weird but his other stances are admirable
socialism,not_removed,lol yup redditors just cant handle the existence of a radical black man in the public sphere
socialism,not_removed,it seems kind of counterproductive to me if on one hand a lot of people are being exposed to left thoughts and class consciousness for the first time because of bernie sanders and some further left guy accuses you of wanting nice white supremacy i mean i understand and sympathize with what baraka means by that but its alienating for no reason and why the left will just keep eating itself
socialism,not_removed,no i accused the guy calling me a deplorable of being ctr
socialism,not_removed,nuclear is safer and cleaner also nuclear energy can cleanly meet the demand of a growing population until other sources can meet the demand
socialism,not_removed,because nuclear is the shit dog its clean safe reliable has tremendous output and we know how to do it also wifi yes gmo probably im confused by this are you saying there is merit in her stances here
socialism,not_removed,her platform says advance workers rights to form unions achieve workplace democracy and keep a fair share of the wealth they create but sure lets keep calling her a filthy capitalist in the name of ideological purity nothing like fracturing the left am i right
socialism,not_removed,what leftwing movement
socialism,not_removed,she gives american leftists a bad name with her idiotic theories about vaccines nuclear power and apparently now fucking wifi thats the problem with how the american political system is structured anyone with left leaning tendencies who actually wants to be able to make a change will join the democrats
socialism,not_removed,that might be the best way to go that or check out if a suitable socialist candidate is on the ballot i think the psl candidate isnt very good but i might be confusing it with a different one
socialism,not_removed,the more you know
socialism,not_removed,pretty sure jill stein also wants to legalize weed though
socialism,not_removed,i gotta say that carl sagan kind of helped me go farther left lol the pale blue dot speech that we listened to while i was in high school changed my view on the world i dont have a neck beard sadly though it is probably for the better haha
socialism,not_removed,he still gets his fair share of ultradownvoted posts though remember when he told someone with depression to stop being a victim and pull himself up by his bootstraps
socialism,not_removed,libertarians are at their best weird dudes who get naked at political conventions and politicians who will stick their tongue out at interviewers that shit i could get behind
socialism,not_removed,what is a stemlord
socialism,not_removed,in the book the chomskyfocault debate he deviates on the subject of human nature to talk about the pragmatism of voting democrat especially hillary clinton in this context then he supports his decision by speaking slight about how we can reach true freedom through libertarian socialist means to be fair his arguments on human nature are actually anticapitalist but when it comes to current politica and economics hes definitely a reformist liberal
socialism,not_removed,it doesnt ive been under the impression all this time that it means white supremacy
socialism,not_removed,its alienating for no reason and why the left will just keep eating itself bingo i see this all the time among the left and im sure its gone on far longer than anyone here has been alive its like a weird competition to see who can be the most pure in their belief
socialism,not_removed,marxism isnt about pandering to privileged classes its about finding the people who will immediately benefit from socialism and getting them radicalized and politicized in america thats new africans impoverished whites prisoners indigenous peoples undocumented workers the lgbt community etc but you know why try to meet them where they live right does it dawn on you that perhaps barakas words speak to their experience the left in the united states has spent the better part of the last halfcentury trying to make itself accessible to firstworld eurocentric aristocratic values and guess what it doesnt work because why the fuck would it its patently unmarxist and revisionist to think that thats somehow an effective political strategy
socialism,not_removed,still where is the proof just curious
socialism,not_removed,cleaner and safer than coal for sure i kinda doubt that its cleaner and safer than wind or solar thou depends on how you weight production impact many small accidents vs few potential devestating ones and little amounts of highly dangerous radiactive material vs lots and lots of old steel and concrete my main gripe with it is how very centralized it needs to be while solar panels and wind generators can be set up by individuals that cetralization presents a major roadblock if you want to use it as a transitional source the cooperations that funded it in the first place wont want to see their source of income be replaced by better technologies
socialism,not_removed,theres no place to put nuclear waste right now thats sort of a problem nuclear waste itself is very dangerous and a legitimate concern
socialism,not_removed,mine work will never be safe the us has a pretty shitty history when it comes to uranium mining too weve massively fucked over the najavo
socialism,not_removed,see my other comment below on nuclear energy and while her wifi ideas are bullshit i still think that gmos are problematic not because of health but because of patent reasons not my field thou if you have good literature on the legal consequences of gmo farming for farmers in the us i would be grateful
socialism,not_removed,ill only push for more nuclear energy if i get to have a nuclear powered car like in fallout
socialism,not_removed,that still isnt socialism though she is a socdem workplace democracy isnt socialism if the workers dont own the mop it is just nice capitalism socialism is worker ownership of the mop and an emergent quality of that would likely be democracy in the workplace
socialism,not_removed,the one that is slowly gaining momentum and has become amenable to socialized health care and greater access to tertiary education despite decades of dissuasive propaganda it isnt socialism but it is certainly leftwing
socialism,not_removed,last time she made the the nuclear power comment she received downvotes youd think thatd show her that people dont care for that particular opinion but instead of doing the politicians thing and just avoidingnot answering a question that may reflect her negatively she instead reasserted her position and last i saw it had achieved downvotes for it
socialism,not_removed,she gives american leftists a bad name with her idiotic theories about vaccines nuclear power and apparently now fucking wifi the whole wifi thing is blown out of proportion her opinions about everything else are shared by the rest of the western left investigate the positions of any socialist party in the west and you will find that their science stances are pretty much identical to the greens if you sincerely want democratic socialism which you may be confusing with classical liberalism eventually you will abandon lesserevilism and start voting green sounds like you are only halfradicalized and still have a long way to go keep reading
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,are you saying that hes a liberal or that hes a reformist theyre not he same thing
socialism,not_removed,i dont get it you think he should not speak his mind just because a social democrat ran for president
socialism,not_removed,impoverished whites are not going to respond well to beeing calling white supremacist just as they were moving left though
socialism,not_removed,i dont necessarily agree the problem with radically politicising people is that they burn out quickly they may go to a few rallies and share posts on facebook and share their politics with friends for a for months but then theyre just disregarded by the majority of people as theyre seen as edgy or just going through a rebellious phase to get the left seen as a strong political force it needs to target more than just poor and oppressed people who wont support you too long once theyre convinced that they should just make peace with the system or when theyre enslaved by their commitments to wages and education to do anything useful a student cant protest during lesson time because theyre hurting their chances of passing exams and getting on in the real world as with any political movement theres little reason to look for support from people who agree with you they support you anyway we need to challenge people who are complacent because the system works for them we need to share the suffering of people who arent able to exploit the system the oppressed will be likely to lean left regardless of whether you radicalise them and theres nothing wrong with doing so but a political movement needs to turn over undecided and opposition supporters to grow in size dapl and student fees and legalizing weed only pull in younger generations while we need them to be mobilised we also need to bring up other failures of capitalism that affect older voters people dont care until it hurts their way of life
socialism,not_removed,you could easily turn this post both ways though you cant have any kind of socialism without convincing people to your side which is what sanders was doing with grassroots movement building and who the fuck is to say it was just priveleged classes i would actually argue the green party is the the one who panders to the whole foods middle class crowd and baraka hasnt really tapped into much outside his academic bubble
socialism,not_removed,google it
socialism,not_removed,nuclear power plants provides significantly more power than pretty much any other kind of plant are significantly more efficient than solar or wind yet have significantly less waste than traditional fossil fuels we use for the bulk of power already and this is an important part here waste products from nuclear plants can be recycled by another kind of plant to generate more power and reduce waste even further in america we bury it jimmy carter thought keeping it around would lead to nuclear proliferation which sounds a bit like a joke coming from an american president the fact that the greens oppose nuclear power absolutely blows my mind what about the birds that fry thinking solar panels are bird baths or that fly into wind turbines if a bird flies into a nuclear plant we just get super birds i can certainly respect the centralization argument however though i would wager a society where such things are collectively operated would opt to be rid of them as other methods become more efficient because who really wants to spend all that time monitoring criticality when they could instead just pop up a panel at home and forget about it
socialism,not_removed,i dont offhand but i agree with you on problems arising from patenting thanks for the clarification
socialism,not_removed,write in macabremelon and ill make it happen
socialism,not_removed,there are two other places in her platform where she mentions workers ownership of the means of production also im assuming thats what she means anyways by keep a fair share of the wealth they create
socialism,not_removed,this sub tend to lean towards full communism for some reason to many american kids who havent realised socialism is essentially central
socialism,not_removed,if you made a post saying to seize the means of production youd get downvotes
socialism,not_removed,that was a bit refreshing i really liked her spat over the jets
socialism,not_removed,but they want to smoke weed and ignore racism
socialism,not_removed,liberals are reformist in practice
socialism,not_removed,strawman nobody is calling poor whites white supremacists i mean unless you totally misinterpret what baraka was saying white people have to deal with the issues of whiteness and patriarchy when you sugarcoat it and prioritize their comfort over those with less privilege you uphold white supremacy edit looks like the class reductionistssalti whites have downvoted me
socialism,not_removed,to get the left seen as a strong political force it needs to target more than just poor and oppressed people what in the hell this isnt materialist at all those who will be most receptive to revolutionary change are those who will immediately benefit from revolutionary change period know who those people are socialism has always been bred out of class struggle your whole comment is full of ahistorical rambling nonsequiters that do not make any sense at all by the way
socialism,not_removed,i wasnt asking for proof that ctr exists i was asking whether there is proof that the user you accuse of being ctr is actually ctr
socialism,not_removed,actually it is safer than a lot of other energy sources less deaths are attributed to nuclear energy than solar and wind a lot of deaths are in the construction and installation of such systems how many wind turbines and solar panels are installed in the world vs nuclear reactors also how many countries without strong worker safety precautions have nuclear reactors i dont disagree with the use of nuclear power im just playing a bit of devils advocate on this argument
socialism,not_removed,thats kinda what i meant with many small accidents vs few potential devestating ones while many people die in normal accidents while building windmills nuclear plants although generally safer contain the potential for far more devestating long term accidents this really doesnt bother me very much as these accidents are still incredibly rare but since we dont really need nuclear power need as in there is no alternative i petition using alternative energy even thou it might be less effective and less elegant at times
socialism,not_removed,thanks
socialism,not_removed,deal
socialism,not_removed,seize the means of production
socialism,not_removed,that doesnt contradict what i just said
socialism,not_removed,i still fail to see how saying pragmatically hey if youre in a swing state you should probably vote clinton because at least shes not a fucking fascist equates to being a liberal or a reformist
socialism,not_removed,i dont have the resources to prove some random account is someone being paid by ctr when people say ctr it isnt just correct the record its a representation of all kinds of dark money being spent to sway political opinion on the internet its just the most famous one so ctr the proof is the super brigading happening in that thread not just downvotes for my comments
socialism,not_removed,on an ama if she posted it are you even trying
socialism,not_removed,ah nice liberals in a socialist subreddit great i encourage you to listen to malcom xs fox v wolf speech maybe that will make you see that there is no pragmatism in voting for an imeralist burgeois criminal over trump edit also why did you kill rosa luxembourg
socialism,not_removed,that was not quite what i meant the percentages wont tell you much about how many turbinespanels exist vs nuclear reactors because nuclear reactor produce much more energy if there are million wind turbines in the world and only nuclear reactors madeup numbers then the number of work accidents involving wind turbines should be much larger also if of those turbines exist in places with poor worker safety regulations it will drive the numbers higher its the same thing when people say do you know that more people die because of dogs than sharks dogs are dangerous sure dogs can be dangerous but how many people hang around sharks as often as dogs its all about normalized numbers how many deaths per reactor vs how many deaths per wind turbine solar panel
socialism,not_removed,only my hardest
socialism,not_removed,similar to what i said to the other reply clinton at least has a centrist facade to hold up as opposed to trumps unrepentantly bigoted and right wing reputation even if you assume the homophobia racism imperialism and bourgeois loyalties are a wash there are still real implications for the working class in this election suggesting otherwise is naive as shit and putting your political preferences over the material conditions in real peoples lives which as you said are still going to be in a decaying capitalist society either way
socialism,not_removed,as if trump isnt also a bourgeois imperialist criminal you dont honestly think hell bomb the middle east and get involved in latin american politics at the first opportunity just like clinton one who has to pander to a base of bigoted proimperialist fascist enablers while himself being an repentant fascist at least clinton has a facade to hold up
socialism,not_removed,try harder then
socialism,not_removed,watch malcom xs speech
socialism,not_removed,ok fair enough i see what you mean and i agree it was just the phrasing that led me to play a bit of devils advocate i do think that nuclear fission is probably our best option if the proper security procedures are in place the risk of another chernobyl is very slim the only point that i can concede to the antinuclear crowd is what to make with the residues the russians bury them in sealed containers in remote regions but its probably not the ideal solution hopefully physicists and engineers can come up with a viable way of using nuclear fusion instead
socialism,not_removed,the facade affects the policies they can support again it all revolves back to pragmatism call me a liberal all you want ill probably be voting stein from solidly blue ny and would rather there not even be a state but id rather have a president who has to appease labor unions and pretend to be progressive over a president who is getting votes based on promises to kill isis families and build a wall to keep out those damn rapists mexicans
socialism,not_removed,you are the white liberal malcom x warned us about and the democratic socialist engels cautioned us in principles of communism
socialism,not_removed,ive watched it and agree with it youre so caught up in calling me a liberal that youre not even paying attention to what ive said you know both the fox and the wolf are dangerous which would you rather be trapped in a cage with malcolm x was cautioning against trusting the fox not choosing it out of necessity over the wolf in a binary situation which is ultimately all bourgeois democracy will ever give us
socialism,not_removed,i have read what you said even when you deleted it if you watched the video and are still voting for hillary then you truly missed the point
socialism,not_removed,i didnt delete anything
socialism,not_removed,for converting people to communism i have found that not mentioning words like socialism communism when discussing theory until they are a comrade works wonders
socialism,not_removed,i tried to get liberals involved would never do that again
socialism,not_removed,i think an organization can only really grow if it is able to develop a clear grand strategy of sorts and actually plug members into concrete projects figure out tangible problems to tackle locally too many groups i see seem to only exist to recruit more people and occasionally sit around and talk about how much capitalism sucks but i dont think many people are really that interested in joining an organization just so they can get more people to join the organization for working with other groups working on clearlydefined tangible projects is key too many coalitions seem to come together without any clear purpose other than we should have a coalition and it eventually fades out because they werent doing anything other than sitting around talking about how their issues relate working on a clearlydefined shorterterm project is good because then you can build relationships while also working on something concrete and through this the groundwork for a larger coalition or merger can be built general social events are nice help organize a potluck or picnic or a wild house party canvass go knock on doors and take a survey of people who are socialist or might be interested go to the business areas and pass out propaganda fliers to the workers until the management calls the cops on you
socialism,not_removed,ironically mentioning socialismcommunism can attract the wrong type in some cases
socialism,not_removed,ha thats so true ive been doing exactly that some people can read between the lines but theyre usually the ones that already know something positive about socialism
socialism,not_removed,hey thanks for replying could you elaborate a little bit more on how specifically you guys do it also ive heard you have a new chapter at ucla congrats
socialism,not_removed,did it work for you guys
socialism,not_removed,hahaha true true well ive noticed that you definitely have to prep people first d without it youre fighting against decades of capitalist propaganda and no matter how much they respect you they will always have these stereotypes in the back of their mind unless you address them first
socialism,not_removed,thats a great answer thanks what are some of the shorterterm projects you find people enjoy most are the most necessary
socialism,not_removed,it varies quite a bit id say everything from writing a research paper to working on a surveyinquiry canvassing session in a neighborhood block to organizing a weekend fundraiserparty fundrager
socialism,not_removed,sweet thanks how do you guys advertise them just standard stuff social media friends or do you flyerreach out in some more creative way
socialism,not_removed,oh cool thats actually pretty smart hey thanks for your replies and good luck to you guys
socialism,not_removed,very schnazzy
socialism,not_removed,looks like you could use some help expanding the list of dictionary terms id recommend mentioning socialism communism and marxism in the dictionary as well but perhaps hyperlink to the faq great explanations by the way it would sort of spoil the neutralpassive vibe of the website but itd be cool if you introduced a heritage tab that lists all of the accomplishments in labor civil and social rights made possible by socialist movements over the span of the past century and a half this might at least slightly improve the tarnished reputation of socialism if they discover that basically every convenience and dignity which they take for granted was fought for by leftist movements
socialism,not_removed,css looks good started reading and found a slight spelling error thought you would like to know its on the basics of socialism page what is capitalism in order to understand why socialism is necesasry you first have to understand what exactly capitalism is
socialism,not_removed,well done looks awesome i bookmarked it and look forward to added content
socialism,not_removed,i think this is a brilliant start but if i was to share this with friendsanyone on the right side of the spectrum they would dismiss it without anything that refutes capitalism i think there needs to be a section next to the basic and advanced sections that strictly showing that capitalism is bad and takes advantage of the workers just my two cents great looking website absolutely gorgeous edit im wrong and i missed the section that had the part i was missing sorry
socialism,not_removed,you forgot to add a html to the link to the anarchist faq the soviet constitution and the cuban constitution they currently link to errors also the link to is broken
socialism,not_removed,looking good some small suggestions keep the header links in their place its a bit disorienting when the link i clicked moved have the active head navigation section color match the color of the main header so its more clear which tab is active
socialism,not_removed,on mobile android chrome i had a lot of left over space on the right side of the text looks great
socialism,not_removed,looks much cleaner
socialism,not_removed,a few things i would use piwik instead of google analytics it enables google to spy on its users why the css from
socialism,not_removed,capitalism allows for private ownership of the means of production ie private productive property how about making it private authoritative ownership and control as opposed to democratic overall the simplicity and substance of the site looks great
socialism,not_removed,looks like you could use some help expanding the list of dictionary terms id recommend mentioning socialism communism and marxism in the dictionary as well but perhaps hyperlink to the faq great explanations by the way i was going to do some hyperlinking backandforth between the faq and the dictionary page but since i mention for example means of production a phrase on the dictionary page on the faq page a lot i was unsure whether i shouldve made all of those mentions hyperlinks or just a few or one mention per question and so on im still not sure how im going to go ahead and actually do it it would sort of spoil the neutralpassive vibe of the website but itd be cool if you introduced a heritage tab that lists all of the accomplishments in labor civil and social rights made possible by socialist movements over the span of the past century and a half this might at least slightly improve the tarnished reputation of socialism if they discover that basically every convenience and dignity which they take for granted was fought for by leftist movements thats a good idea ill do some brainstorming and try to come up with a way to integrate it
socialism,not_removed,oops thanks for letting me know ill fix it right away
socialism,not_removed,ill do some experimenting with fonts and line distances thanks
socialism,not_removed,well the basic page has a pretty long section entitled what problems do socialists have with capitalism
socialism,not_removed,thanks ill fix it as soon as possible edit fixed
socialism,not_removed,alright ill try it out and implement it if it looks good edit fixed
socialism,not_removed,ohh yeah im noticing that now weird i wonder why that is ill try to fix it as soon as possible
socialism,not_removed,i would use piwik instead of google analytics it enables google to spy on its users oh that code is just leftover from when i connected the website to a youtube channel the website isnt actually connected to a google analytics account but ill remove it anyway why the css from why not
socialism,not_removed,i truly apologize i was giving it a glance and looking at the headlines i completely missed that one under the basic section i am sorry keep up the good work i did bookmark it and plan to share the website with my friends and family
socialism,not_removed,because css is maximum fuckery
socialism,not_removed,no worries at all you did make me realise that that section is pretty far down when it should actually be pretty far up ill fix it tomorrow
socialism,not_removed,well still great looking website have been looking for something like this for awhile just sent it off to my friends and family who all think im practically the devil keep up the amazing work
socialism,not_removed,thank you very much and im sorry to hear that about your family i hope my website is enough to convince them that socialism isnt evil or whatever since i made it a point that socialists dont consider capitalists or even capitalism something that is inherently evil capitalism isnt a bad system its preferable to feudalism but when compared to socialism or communism its definitely less desirable for the masses as well outdated and unsustainable and the capitalists themselves arent capitalists because theyre bad people theyre just a product of this outdated system and supporters of capitalism ie liberals conservatives and so on are also products of capitalism and in a way so are us socialists we just have different ways of viewing the world and different solutions for its problems but at the end of the day most of us want everyone on earth to live healthy happy lives the conflict between ideologies occurs when we simply have different ideas for how we should bring about this utopia for a lack of a better word you should tell your family that socialists dont want anyone to be oppressed or for anyone to be poor or unhappy just like liberalsconservatives dont want that even if they disagree with socialists methods they can at least agree with their goals that everyone on earth should have food water shelter as well as access to good education and healthcare because ultimately that is the goal of all ideologies even fascism has an endgoal utopia where people have neither want nor need they just also want to exterminate all the lesser races alright maybe my point doesnt apply to fascists fascists are pretty evil
socialism,not_removed,i made it a point that socialists dont consider capitalists or even capitalism something that is inherently evil capitalism isnt a bad system its preferable to feudalism but when compared to socialism or communism its definitely less desirable for the masses as well outdated and unsustainable i completely agree with this point as a race humans constantly innovate and push forward and thats how i see feudalismcapitalismsocialism i personally see some problems with socialism nothing is perfect but i see it as a step in the right direction towards a better lifestyle for all and thats the way we should continue to push forward as a race we should never ever stagnate and say welp we made it guys seems like this is the best were gonna get socialists dont want anyone to be oppressed agreed we all agree of the time where we all want everyone to live a great perfect life its just that we all disagree on how to get there i am a big fan of democracy which made me realize i was a socialist to me its simple a group of people will get to a better decision than a single person which is pretty much the comparison of socialism vs capitalism while i try to preach socialism to my friendsfamily i still express that they need to vote and participate in politics so that their view is represented even if they disagree with socialismmy view
socialism,not_removed,ill copypaste a comment i made awhile ago centrally planned doesnt mean that there has to be a big bureau somewhere who decides everything these days distributed computingwith full homomorphic encryption and whatnot would let us estimate prices and coordinate largescale production much more efficiently than any central bureau would be able to and probably more efficiently than a market could
socialism,not_removed,many people here are antifree market what do you mean by free market if you are referring to a capitalist market economy there is some confusion which should be cleared up markets can — and for historical purposes have — existed outside of private property restrictions they are not synonymous entities there are different mechanisms which could come into play within a market economy i would describe myself as an anarchist without adjectives and therefore would not be in total opposition to the proposed market frameworks à la mutualism the different economic systems suggested by various leftanarchist contingents have potential and although i would argue that they should follow some basic principles there is not a unilateral argument that could apply to all human societies — or so as i see it so would the government determine prices absolutely not lets assume that we are working with a system which basis itself off of noncapitalist market functions with a demurrage currency of labour vouchers in such an instance price is nevertheless determined still according to a presupposed set of variables for example the labour theory of value is something to be considered as an established basis for an items true worth although there are other things to take into consideration such as products which are necessary for survival and security in the human society what constitutes a market item and a necessary item are left to be determined as markets cannot fully account for human necessity and arguably should not be handed control of them even so proudhons market system was controlled by what he called the agroindustrial federation which effectively regulated the market economy to account for a production framework of need not profit this much i would say is enough to provide for all thus government is not necessary it has been said that proudhon laid the basis for the theoretical tendency of syndicalism and semantics aside both theories render the government powerless and useless though i am no mutualist — again i am an anarchist without adjectives and therefore reject one single proposal i am still guided by leftwing anarchism as an overall tendency though
socialism,not_removed,we wouldnt have a market markets are one of the most inefficient methods of goods distribution that humanity has created
socialism,not_removed,im a proponent of what one may call a gift economy though i dont really like the term basically distribution is based entirely on want no exchange at all this includes the belief that things such as stealing or needless overconsumption are ills symptomatic of capitalism
socialism,not_removed,would there really be prices in a socialist society
socialism,not_removed,things wouldnt the most powerful co ops take advantage of this and manipulate prices is there any studies done with a computer setting prices
socialism,not_removed,evidence
socialism,not_removed,for the initial transitory period almost certainly like with everything else socialism will evolve over time what im trying to describe is a very earlystage version to be implemented maybe a decade or two postrevolution
socialism,not_removed,maybe but in spirit of what youre getting at market socialism would certainly seem to only perpetuate many of capitalisms ills potentially yes httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprojectcybersyn might be an example of what youre looking for also youd probably like to read httpricardoecnwfueducottrellsocialismbooknewsocialismpdf
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,look around you the massive inequality when it comes to the property of different individuals and all the resources that are wasted are proof that markets are inefficient if i have one dollar i can get an apple if i have two hundred dollars i can get two hundred apples why would i need two hundred times more of something that other people have if i have enough money in a market i can get four cars while someone else with less money may have no cars at all or have only one when we both could have two why do i need more than them markets are inefficient because they do not distribute according to need but according to how much money one has
socialism,not_removed,um then how would a centrally planned economy change that would and get you the same amount would there be stopping in place
socialism,not_removed,you keep talking about markets why would things have prices if there are no markets why would there be currency if there are no markets a planned economy is based on the principle of need the people assuming the role of the producer and the consumer distribute resources efficiently so as to cover everyones needs as well as possible unlike the chaos that exists in markets such an economy is well planned as the people having assumed both roles of the producer and the consumer know what they need before it is produced
socialism,not_removed,so then whats the difference between communism and socialism in this instance
socialism,not_removed,there is none
socialism,not_removed,you do realize that the cuban missile crisis was in response to the bay of pigs invasion along with the other invasions the us was planing
socialism,not_removed,ive heard a lot of non sense about fidel but warmonger is a first
socialism,not_removed,citation needed
socialism,not_removed,i mean if your definition of warmonger is someone who has been involved in going to war you cant really argue that he wasnt but on this issue and many others he has made huge improvements in attitude since the no wars since cant say the same about the uk or the us
socialism,not_removed,warmonger is someone who advocates for war fidel was the opposite of it every war he was part of was to defend cuba from us aggression and help in the fight against apartheid thats why cuba is known for sending troops of doctors not soldiers
socialism,not_removed,exactly i agree but there are people who point to armed conflicts cuba partook in as evidence that he was a warmonger but my point was that even then cuba hasnt been to war in years its more than a little hypocritical to call him a warmonger and not say worse about everyone else
socialism,not_removed,capitalism destroys social trust it turns every service into a scam all work into debasement and every relationship into a costbenefit analysis look around america and ask yourself how many businesses legitimately solve peoples problems or are the source of those problems in the first place would people eat fatty surgery addictive foods if they werent robbed of every chance at selfactualization and every pleasure except animal urges would people spend hours watching trash tv if they didnt need cheap mindless entertainment to numb them would people get ripped off on cars and repairs and insurance if personal transportation wasnt completely designed around the automobile in a society founded equally shared wealth alienation would be reduced simply because there would be fewer systemic reasons to fear or exploit other people
socialism,not_removed,alienation is about the workers not being in control of the productand everything else of their labor what does that have to do with producing to demandof course true demand not manipulated artificially created demand of capitalism
socialism,not_removed,but wouldnt they not be in control of their labor because they need to do whats in demand not what they wish to do
socialism,not_removed,why would workers not wish to serve their fellow workers
socialism,not_removed,in a higher phase of communist society after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor has vanished after labor has become not only a means of life but lifes prime want after the productive forces have also increased with the allaround development of the individual and all the springs of cooperative wealth flow more abundantly only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners from each according to his ability to each according to his needs if you understand the theory of alienation then you should understand the importancerelevance of the first bolded point in short communism although marx only refers to this as a phase of communism is usually referring to the stage in history which marx is describing at this point the social and economic development of society has progressed to enable a complete abandonment of the need for the division of labor the society he is describing is one where the demands and needs of people are met independent of the particular political conditions set upon labor it is also one in which peoples attitude towards labor itself has changed due in large part because of this development
socialism,not_removed,out of all the protest moves this has to be the most harmless and yet the party members are acting like the people threw a bomb they need to lighten up
socialism,not_removed,well it was kind of diserved for what she said i had expected her to resign after the quite nationalist statement she gave
socialism,not_removed,this was a very infantile thing to do i would prefer it if these socalled antifascists went out and did something a bit more well antifascist for a change i mean its not like that rightwingers wont treasure yet another opportunity to spin leftists as being nothing more than immature clowns cakes included
socialism,not_removed,great stuff my comrades and i had a good laugh her antimigration rhetoric nationalism and procapitalist antimarxian opportunism are disgusting
socialism,not_removed,i hate how entitled members of parties that get big start acting they forget their roots condemning other leftists so harshly over shoving a pie in someones face just shows how much they think like the political establishment an attack on us all really pretentious petitbourgeois
socialism,not_removed,what exactly did she say i read something about comments she made but i cant find any english articles
socialism,not_removed,well she is definitely not procapitalist far more marxist than barsch but that one statement of her was just stupid
socialism,not_removed,she said something like who attacks our laws here doesnt deserve a treatment as a guest dont know how to translate gastrecht guest right literally i will correct myself tomorrow if i didnt quote something right since i am too tired for the english language right now
socialism,not_removed,was that made in regards to the cologne attacks if so im not sure how thats a bad statement so long as it isnt aimed at all refugees and by my limited reading it doesnt seem to be
socialism,not_removed,it implies that the refugees are like guests here and should therefore behave like a guest but they are not any guests who you can kick out if they dont behave like you would like them to we gave them a home here and thats why they should get the same punishment in a standart prison germans who rape people dont get exiled or anything so by kicking refugees out for comitting crimes you treat them as if they were as humans not equal to germans ands thats pretty fascist still this was just a stupid statement she gave maybe because she was more focused on the feminist point of view when talking about the cologne attacks she is still a great socialist anticapitalist politician and i think she represents our party pretty well
socialism,not_removed,well i do agree with your central premise ie some other form of punishment over exile you cant really send them back even thinking on a practical level though i am sympathetic to her notion in the eyes of many people what those individuals have done is spit in the face of the goodwill that has been offered to them and far more importantly committed some heinous crimes to ignore this issue or go soft on those individuals plays right into the hands of the far right it sends average working class people right into their arms an mp making these comments in anger is understandable as you said she was speaking as a feminist and rightly so but these antifascists actions just show the disconnect between themselves and working class sentiment maybe theyd best remember anti fascists attack fascists
socialism,not_removed,i am not saying you should go soft on those individuals i just want that they are treated the same as any other germans too rapism is the highest stage of sexism and should be punished harder than it is currently but everyone equally
socialism,not_removed,were on the same page there yeah true i suppose where wagenknecht is drawing controversy is of course on the guest issue ie the nature of newcomers
socialism,not_removed,love judy butler
socialism,not_removed,japanese regulators have found that the woman matsuri takahashi had been forced to work excessively long hours the punishing workload resulted in her suicide they ruled takahashi had clocked about hours of overtime in the month leading up to her death authorities found ishiis resignation comes after investigators raided dentsus offices japans ministry of health labor and welfare has referred the case to prosecutors i am sure this will greatly impact the severance package shell receive i almost typed that without grinning
socialism,not_removed,thats what trump supporters want america to become as someone from east asia you dont want to be like that worker rights are very weak here
socialism,not_removed,god this is simply terrible that poor woman
socialism,not_removed,hours of overtime in the month of her death not hours of worked time hours of overtime thats crazy
socialism,not_removed,takahashi had clocked about hours of overtime in the month leading up to her death authorities found all voluntary of course ancaps
socialism,not_removed,shell
socialism,not_removed,well its only of overtime per week sadly workers have suffered worse assuming a hr work week work hrs per day days a week then hrs on the weekend ive seen comrades who had to work hr weeks on the regular shit is sadder than we give it credit its common everywhere im curious about her commute too imagine working hrs a day and having to commute hrs each way everyday you wake up and go to work then come home and all you can do is sleep the only way out is death
socialism,not_removed,source
socialism,not_removed,why didnt she just find a new job also shheeeee kill herself this is all her fault
socialism,not_removed,more like forced capitalism forces you to get a job
socialism,not_removed,right my bad great catch editing it now
socialism,not_removed,yeah i know its hollywood and all that so we cant be expecting much but in dubious battle is my favourite steinbeck and one of my favourite books of all time so i thought of giving this a shot the themes are extremely relevant to this sub of course
socialism,not_removed,steinbeck as well is a communist
socialism,not_removed,one of my favourite books too i cant help but think all references to the party are going to be cut out if they wish to portray the workers as the heroes of the piece
socialism,not_removed,i really enjoyed the book how well do you think they followed the plot hopefully they didnt make too many changes
socialism,not_removed,here are two early reviews of the film
socialism,not_removed,i really hope not
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,have you seen post
socialism,not_removed,i feel like the misconception comes from that the ussr and prc had state led and owned economies its more advantageous to blame state mismanagement on communism rather than the bureaucracy because that would discredit bureaucracy in the capitalist powers as well
socialism,not_removed,leopold and the congo free state iranian revolution pinochet
socialism,not_removed,they also selectively choose which countries are capitalist they wouldnt call for example the soviet union or yugoslavia capitalist even though by a marxist analysis they clearly were
socialism,not_removed,one thing i like to do whenever people bring up deaths because of communism is list a multiplicity of deaths in capitalist nations from wars famines natural disasters terrorist attacks and so on they like to say but you cant blame war on capitalism because its not a part of the system in which case i turn the very same argument on them coupled by saying hey im just judging capitalism along the very same lines you judge communism i dont see the problem
socialism,not_removed,stop using totalitarian regimes as examples of the ideology you espouse if people point to the ussr as socialist point to the fact that lenin himself called the ussr a statecapitalist system the ussr was not socialist neither was maoist china and neither are cuba and venezuela chomksy put it well when he said the ussr claimed to be both socialist and democratic when it fell everyone crowed about what a horrible defeat for socialism that represented well what about democracy was the collapse of the ussr a horrible blow to democracy as well why not because it was and is convenient to western propagandists to take the claims to socialism by totalitarian regimes at face value while simultaneously ignoring their claims to democracy as irrelevant its classic doublethink america has functioned as a blatant oligarchy for about decades now yet we all still call it a democracy how many of us still believe that americas military adventurism is motivated by altruistic interest in promoting democracy why then should we continue to accept that socialism is encapsulated by the likes of the ussr we need to stop playing the tune of the hegemony
socialism,not_removed,as a canadian i just wanna say were reeeeeeeally sorry for those residential schools
socialism,not_removed,nazis had a free market hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
socialism,not_removed,nope thats amazing ill keep it saved to link to people thanks
socialism,not_removed,furthermore because capitalist countries have economies led by the will of private investors its easier to blame issues under capitalism on private people such as those that cannot obtain food or more rarely the private investors therefore any issues under capitalism dont mean capitalism isnt working it means that individuals are at fault at that capitalism just needs to be repaired
socialism,not_removed,hello i feel forced to point out that a lot of marxist and anarchistof which im neither dont like the ussr if i had to recommend one reading homework for you it would be to read up on burkina fasomarxism and revolutionary cataloniaanarchismish i will leave links down below have a great day httpsenwikipediaorgwikithomassankara httpsenwikipediaorgwikirevolutionarycatalonia
socialism,not_removed,they clearly did not but not because they didnt like free markets but because they didnt let anyone participate
socialism,not_removed,no it was obviously because they didnt like the free market hitler believed it was an ebil jewish invention along with marxism hence why he established a mixed system
socialism,not_removed,well technically the us is also a mixed system where do you draw the line
socialism,not_removed,you draw the line when there is a free market its exactly the same reason why the nazis werent actually socialist the private sector still operated in the market you cant just call them socialist and then ask where do you draw the line
socialism,not_removed,you will not believe how happy i was when it said revolutionary black panther party instead of new black panther party
socialism,not_removed,can you tell them to lower their weapons one of the party members asked warnick they need to lower their weapons warnick responded were just being ready sir fuck off also im sure the nra will spring to the defense of these young patriots who have literally had their guns seized yep any minute now
socialism,not_removed,same i havent heard of them though are they not reactionaries like the nbpp
socialism,not_removed,they were actually founded by a black panther and engage heavily in food aid programs thats good enough for me
socialism,not_removed,i think its a good idea but i also think there should be more explicitly socialist ones as well theres a lack of serious socialist infographics and similar content maybe create two separate types so one group can focus on providing a more accurate history of social movements imperialism etc than mainstream media gives while the other uses a combination of historyfacts and theory to spread a more openly socialist message
socialism,not_removed,assuming i think the us constitution and the ideology it was based off of are legitimate lol what
socialism,not_removed,wot
socialism,not_removed,im extremely confused with what youve done here im not apt to bother with constitutional law given i think the whole damn things a rotten sham
socialism,not_removed,when you are an anarchistsympathizing socialist who bombs the parliament and then a few decades later you get a statue in the same parliament right between a statist and a fascist
socialism,not_removed,great man sometimes i think of the alternate timeline where indian independence was lead by radical antiimperlialists instead of useless liberals who built such a disaster of a government
socialism,not_removed,for those unfamiliar with bhagat singhs life
socialism,not_removed,inquilab zindabad
socialism,not_removed,just to chime in but bhagat singh bombed the parliament not with an intention to kill anyone but more as a symbolic gesture in his own words to make the deaf hear for his actions he was hanged along with his comrades sukhdev and rajguru
socialism,not_removed,orange is the new brown
socialism,not_removed,donald trump is not america donald trump is the cancer that humanity has been battling since it was born if people who wish to judge america as some kind of monolith want to write these kind of smug articles i suppose that is their prerogative but pragmatically the united states has a vastly more powerful military and economy than any other nation in the world americas foreign policy history is ugly to be sure but just imagine what could be accomplished with a genuine maniac at the helm this is a man who openly advocates torture and war crimes you think youve seen the worst of america baby you aint seen nothing yet
socialism,not_removed,is trump also httpmakemeamericacom
socialism,not_removed,americas foreign policy history is ugly to be sure but just imagine what could be accomplished with a genuine maniac at the helm yeah just imagine a potus whose chief debate strategy vis a vis their opponent is mccarthyism and who is just itching to get into a war with russia
socialism,not_removed,honestly im hoping for a trump victory and theres no way the us could get more evil in its foreign policy from madelaine albright with her banality of evil interview where she said dead iraqi children was worth it who clinton said was one of her idols to clinton whos war profiteering foreign policy has claimed millions of lives at least with trump however dishonest the man actually is his politics is honest its capitalism with its ugly disfigured face so everyone can plainly see clinton is capifalism with a half human face attempting to shore up the black vote while her husband is directly responsible for the destruction of so many black lives with his infamous omnibus crime bill meh im not a yank but i honestly fail to see how things could get worse under trump clinton is liable to get into a war with russia with her syria policy and trump wants to disband nato
socialism,not_removed,who is just itching to get into a war with russia you mean clinton trump despite all his faults would likely save us from one
socialism,not_removed,theres a difference between taking control of the big bloody machine and it continuing to do big bloody things sometimes with your encouragement and sometimes not versus wanting to take control of it for the express purposes of doing even bigger and bloodier things im not denying the terrible actions of the us in the past but consider the fact those things happened under the watch of individuals who at least by most accounts had good intentions how much worse can they get with someone with explicitly bad intentions at the helm i dont think we should venture to find out
socialism,not_removed,his politics is honest uh wtf his political are most certainly not honest in any way shape or form hes a multibillionaire running on an antiestablishment platform whose stated goal is to get big money out of politics there isnt a magical difference between the lies of the man and the lies of his platform if his politics were honest he wouldnt be working so hard to attract bernie voters theres no way the us could get more evil in its foreign policy this is just wrong this isnt even the most evil theyve ever been before drone strikes and even middle eastern occupations cant hold a candle to what they did to the north vietnamese the moro the sandinistas guatemala or the indigenous nations of north america where on earth does this confidence come from that foreign policy couldnt be any worse on what grounds can such a claim be made for this past year people on the left have absolutely justifiably used drone strikes and the vicious clinton state department as a means to counterbalance liberal claims about her progressiveness and as something to respond to lesserevilism with the problem is that now its morphed into this indescribably absurd notion that clinton is the candidate who would carry out drone strikes like trump wouldnt as if they dont call the same dozen people to sit in the situation room with them and as if they would ever totally overrule their chiefs of staff and intelligence director telling them that drone strikes are whats necessary and as if the president is in charge of military operations to a degree where theyre doing anything more than authorize whats put in front of them and as if there is any chance that donald trump would avoid double tapping the exact same pashtun wedding party that hillary clinton would if they were told it was a good way to off some terrorists in the short term no matter how many others it creates any candidate who gets elected is going to posture and swing the usafs dick around in order to look tough come reelection time these are not democratic or republican policies so much as they are american policies and the strategic goals of the united states in the middle east are not magically transformed by something so petty as a federal election trump wants to disband nato no he doesnt he wants to be president why are we taking him at his word around here sorry this post comes off as so heated but i feel like im taking crazy pills sometimes
socialism,not_removed,i honestly fail to see how things could get worse under trump my biggest fear would be national righttowork laws im a union man and trump hates unions and refuses to acknowledge them or even sign a contract when his employees vote one in and if something were to happen to trump the idea of president pence is terrifying to me still not voting for hillary though
socialism,not_removed,at least with trump however dishonest the man actually is his politics is honest its capitalism with its ugly disfigured face so everyone can plainly see the only potential bright side to a trump presidency is that we would finally hit rock bottom i dont know if wed actually be able to do anything with it though
socialism,not_removed,yup
socialism,not_removed,uh wtf his political are most certainly not honest in any way shape or form im not talking about the literal context of what he talks about im talking about the actual context by following what hes said and how hes acted trumps politics is honest and simple when you analyse him hes out for himself and himself alone hes not fueled by ideology if communism was popular in the us hed be praising lenin he was praising refugees before he slanted to the right to pick up on the current of antimigrant sentiment in the us the problem is that now its morphed into this indescribably absurd notion that clinton is the candidate who would carry out drone strikes like trump wouldnt etc so sure hed carry out the same drone strike carry out the same syria policy as clinton of funding and arming terrorists to fuck with russia so why should anyone prefer clinton over trump clinton is much more media adept and savvy at presenting a nice face whilst murdering hundreds of thousands of people trump would frankly struggle to maintain the mountain of lies that is built up to sustain the us system this is proven by how much of a shambles his reputation is in how many media fuck ups he makes etc whilst you have to read through hacked emails to get a glimpse into hcs sociopathic underpinnings if were going to be idealist about the election then sure i want to resurrect lenin and have him murder every capitalist in the us split the country into individual countries for each state but its a horse race and frankly the only worse thing than trump being president is hilary clinton
socialism,not_removed,yeah see the left tried that once back in the day
socialism,not_removed,yawn
socialism,not_removed,im talking about the actual context by following what hes said and how hes acted trumps politics is honest and simple when you analyse him hes out for himself and himself alone are you saying that his lying is honest because its selfinterested he has lied and acted dishonestly there is no way in which he has been honest do not mistake poorly disguised selfinterest for honesty in the way that millions of americans are right now so why should anyone prefer clinton over trump listen if you see anyone who says this let me know cause it sure as shit wasnt me hillary clintons reputation is also in a shambles by the standards of any other election year a good amount of her dirty laundry has been made public as has trumps her supporters dont give a shit and neither do his i fail to see how his incompetence at presenting a reasonable human face to the public means anything there was this other president involved in sexbased scandals a while back and after him there was one who sucked at looking competent in from of the media neither failing produced meaningful change if were going to be idealist what an odd accusation you have made no case that i can understand for a trump presidency being superior to a clinton presidency
socialism,not_removed,if your biggest fear is right to work considering trump literally called for the hanging of five innocent black and latinx kids it really blows his fear really blows i mean trump can call for anything but if you want to talk about actual policy plans right to work is a big one that this person values really highly im not saying right to work wouldnt devastate minority communities too and im entirely picking a bone and being pedantic and im not trying to or meaning to call you out and i know its sounding like that but there was a lot of this stuff on this sub during the primaries and its pretty upsetting maybe you shouldnt get upset and accept not everyone thinks about things the same way and has different points of view about the election even among socialists being concerned about one policy doesnt mean you think trumps other racist rhetoric is ok
socialism,not_removed,never said it was just trying to find some good in this current shit show
socialism,not_removed,youre right the fears arent mutually exclusive it was a bad post and i recognized that as i wrote it it was imprecise and the language was bad and accusatory and i didnt convey at all what i wanted

socialism,not_removed,one of my favorite talks while i have serious political disagreements with hedges for starters him saying its not a radical movements job to seize power yeah speak for yourself fam this dialogue is still awesome oh yeah dat shout out to carl dix of the rcpusa in the audience lmaooooo
socialism,not_removed,it is awesome as are a lot of the talks the new school puts out i almost wish i went there for grad school because of the talks alone
socialism,not_removed,my dream is to go there for grad school but its like dollars a year 😐
socialism,not_removed,capitalism does fail about once every twenty years every depression and recession is a failure of capitalism
socialism,not_removed,liberals scream about the failures of socialism well invading socialist counties embargoing them toppling democratically elected socialist governments and replacing them with fascist client states something important to know when liberals complain about the ussrs centralized planning because muh efficiency what they dont realize is that the human development index of the ussr was putting it in the top thirty countries compare that to the russian federation which has an hdi of
socialism,not_removed,if someones drowning should i say whats in it for me to get involved what do i get out of it what profits will counter the risks id be forced to take on if cold calculating and cruel is what they want then let them have it
socialism,not_removed,stress the philosophical basis of our gripe with capitalism especially labor theory of value get it drilled into peoples minds that wage labor is theft once you have that basis people will understand more easily the overarching class struggle and also how ltv extends to our support for gender and racial liberation when people try and hit you with communism killed quadrillion point out the countless deaths due to capitalist famines wars colonialism poverty in general point out how the us government outright assassinated black panther party higherups show people that the us and likeminded capitalist societies have been even more authoritarian at times than the communist boogeymen
socialism,not_removed,first it assumes the current alternative of capitalism is working its not really working for the many people who are at the bottom both in wealthy countries and worldwide its working to produce a lot of consumer products and executives but not much for individuals this argument also include all the times capitalism has outright failed in entire countries which is a logical antidote to the claim socialism has failed and is therefore unworthy countries have overthrown capitalist governments and societal arrangements just the same as some socialist ones have come and gone the fact that any given society doesnt exist indicate a failure but rather a destruction by some other force there are socialist countries or countries with socialist arrangements in some form from south america to europe to asia catalonia the french commune native american tribes were communal with socialist attributes they were wiped out because of greedy colonialists not because socialism failed lastly in terms of marx a main argument is that capitalism is a stage on the way to socialism and then communism in this regard few if any countries have truly had a full marxist revolution the us in this theory is actually ripe for socialism
socialism,not_removed,look into the mondragon cooperative and a place called freetown chritiania
socialism,not_removed,anytime someone says look at what socialism did in the early century just point out that capitalism did wonders in weimar and rome
socialism,not_removed,also worth pointing out that in revolutionary catalonia production increased and many nonsocialist historians admit it was a successful society the reasons it isnt around today are very different to other socialist societies so its a good counter example
socialism,not_removed,i think the first step is just to get socialists on the same page as far as doing away with the no true scotsman game we play with the history of socialism guess what not everything in history of socialism is pretty but we arent going to get any where further before be can recognize all the countries that did have socialist experiments and can evaluate the good and bad of each one this means we do need to come to terms with the ussr albania china dprk gdr vietnam laos cuba and every other socialist state that has existed yeah not everything was sunshine and rainbows mistakes were made but if we are to maintain being socialists we need to learn from those who came before us and recognize their very real successes and learn how to avoid their very terrible mistakes i think we need to also stop trying to draw the comparison between any given socialist state and the western capitalist nations but rather to comparisons over wether of not people were generally better off after the revolution in their country i think its probably the case that true socialism wont be possible until there are no more imperialcapitalist countries to interfere with it anymore but until you let your western prejudices go about trusting that those socialists were doing the best they could with what they had and are not actually crazied mad men we arent going to learn from our past frankly it doesnt sound to convincing to say ah well sure dozens of countries have declared socialism many of which dramatically raised the standard of living in a very short period of time but none of them are true socialism because they did bad stuff while fighting for their existence if we claim every single country that has claimed socialism isnt really socialism well it doesnt look like its really that practical a system does it
socialism,not_removed,when people say that socialism has always failed they mostly refer to the soviet union or south american revolutions neither were cases of socialism but state capitalism state capitalism failed and rightly so sadly stalin has poisoned the term socialismcommunism its a shame

socialism,not_removed,burkina faso under thomas sankara had a socialist ideology they were succeeding until sankara was killed in a coup funded by france and his right hand man was placed into power
socialism,not_removed,hey op so in response to your original question about specific examples of capitalist countries attacking a socialist or generally left wing movement there are a ton of examples look at the history of guatemala in the to the present the us based united fruit company got the cia to overthrow a democratically elected president because that president was in favor of land reforms the cia then installed a series of brutal military dictators responsible for countless human rights abuses and genocide against native americans irancontra republican demigod ronald reagan sold weapons to iran and used the profits to fund right wing drug cartels contras to wage a campaign of terror against the democratically elected left wing government in nicaragua just about every successful left wing movement in latin america has come under attack either directly or indirectly by the us not every movement attack by the us was necessarily socialist but they were left leaning at the very least fbi assassinated chicago black panther fred hampton his only crime was organizing a coalition of black hispanic and white groups that were opposed to racism and capitalism for years police called him a terrorist his murder sickens me to no end an fbi informant drugged hampton who didnt use any drugs at all with sedatives then police raided his apartment shot him in his sleep right next to his month pregnant wife look into the fbi program cointelpro it was a program created by j edgar hoover to surpess left wing movements he didnt like also target by this program was martin luther king jr and other civil rights movements this example may be a little controversial during the spanish civil war the nazis backed the fascists led by francisco franco while the west did almost nothing for the republicans which were an alliance of anarchists socialists communists stalinists mls the ussr gave support to the stalinist elements of the republicans but in turn also attacked the anarchist and nonstalinist groups i use this as an example of capitalist forces attacking socialists because socialism to me means anarchismliberatianism im not a fan of the ussr and consider it state capitalist even that aside though it is a clear example of a capitalist force which i consider fascists to be attacking a socialist force the anarchists lastly during the early a group of powerful businessmen were planning to overthrow fdr and install a fascist state it was called the business plot check it out its really interesting heres a wikipedia link to give you a general summary httpsenwikipediaorgwikibusinessplot these are just the examples i can think of off the top of my head i didnt even get too much into the attack on left wingsocialistcommunist movments in the us pretty much ever since the fdr new deal after the capitalists in america felt threatened by the left and launched an all out assault on the working class this can be seen with unions especially ever since that pig reagan took office something like less than of private workers are in a uninon and wages are at the lowest theyve been thats no coincidence the west has a long history of attacking leftistsocialist movement across the globe and at home the idea that socialism has simply just been left on its own and failed because it only works on paper is a joke
socialism,not_removed,capitalism is also constantly destroying itself if you are looking for constant guaranteed stability then try feudalism the argument supposes some stability in capitalism that does not exist
socialism,not_removed,mine line on this question has always been yes but look how good even bad socialism works and furthermore many of times socialism failed it was a result of not being socialist enough
socialism,not_removed,my primary argument against this line of thinking is that it has never been allowed to work every time there has been a socialist uprising it has been systematically crushed either financially or physically by the capitalist forces of the industrialized north i would imagine the concern has more to do with the feasibility of socialist economics rather than whether or not a revolution or insurrection is successful and whether or not a socialist government can function countering this argument is fairly straightforward provide a technical definition of socialism and present the criteria for determining whether or not an economy can be considered socialist or not and then demonstrate how historical economic systems fail to meet this criteria acknowledge the facts for example the ussr was a socialist state officially dedicated to the construction of socialism however having a socialist state is not the same thing as having a socialist system at best the ussrs economic system can be seen as a transitional system at worst it was a form of state capitalism that due to internal contradictions could not advance toward socialism if they counter by claiming that the ussr called its economic system socialist retort by explaining that official labels are adopted for reasons of political expediency and propaganda and thus cannot be taken at face value and cannot substitute serious analysis of an economys actual processes as for why the soviettype economic system wasnt socialist meaning a qualitatively different economic system from capitalism it has to do with the fact that defining characteristics of capitalism were still present wagelabor labor markets the accumulation of capital even though the soviet government tried to suppress private business activity it never succeeded in creating a genuine alternative hence the contradiction manifested itself in the grey economy and black market activity there was state ownership but state ownership by itself doesnt constitute social ownership social appropriation and control of the surplus product and aside from yugoslavia which can be considered to be a form of market socialism any other national economic system throughout history has been capitalist even if they were governed by socialist or social democratic parties essentially socialism has yet to exist in any meaningful sense and on any meaningful scale an orthodox marxist such as myself would argue that socialism can only emerge once capitalism has exhausted its historical necessity meaning the dynamic of capital accumulation has rendered itself redundant and the technical preconditions for socialism a sociallyowned economy that isnt driven by the accumulation of capital have been satisfied which arguably have only been satisfied in the late and early centuries with the rise of automation and information technology that make voluntary associated labor and realtime nonmarket resource allocation feasible any attempts to introduce socialism purely out of ethical concerns that fail to take the material conditions of society into account were doomed to fail
socialism,not_removed,my short answer would be its not fair to say socialism has failed its more honest and historically correct to say that various socialist movements some of which temporarily enjoyed state power were ultimately defeated by their mortal enemy the forces of imperialism another short answer could be no the socialist revolutions failed socialism didnt fail it was defeated and then you could list all the times the left was wiped out after daring to temporarily defeat the forces of capital michael parenti makes a great point in his reflections on the overthrow of communism speech where he points out that the newly formed soviet union didnt enjoy one single day of peace not one single day where the soviets could attend to the tasks of socialism without having to defend against the massive counterrevolution being waged against them by the capitalist countries of the world the socialists of the world are trying to resolve the major contradiction of capitalism that we have socialised production but not the ownership of production this is a worldwide task and until weve accomplished this or at least destroyed the main instituitions preventing us from beginning to accomplish this ie the state powers of the imperialist countries you cant say socialism doesnt work really if its a friend saying this they could do with some education on the matter but if its someone attached to a profitmaking enterprise its simply crude ahistorical procapitalist propaganda and very tired and boring propaganda at that
socialism,not_removed,have you read in defense of lost causes i think you would like it
socialism,not_removed,socialism has always failed and will always fail is not an argument
socialism,not_removed,examples that you know of of socialism activism or socialism revolutions have been counteracted by government powers between any countriesgroups would be helpful the social democrats and the communist party of germany in were crushed as was every single political organization by the nazis the trade unionists were shut down as a group soon after all other political parties were dissolved as were the local and provincial governments they were smeared by propaganda and a lengthy campaign of fear of a violent communist revolution that never came and was never going to come the communist party of germany in had never used violence and had no plans to do so the nazis used propaganda the armies of the sa ss the reichswehr and their total control of government to suppress any dissent killing opposition leaders violently disrupting opposition rallies shutting down presses and radio and smashing headquarters people fled for their lives and the opposing parties dissolved without any real fight realizing that it was a lost cause hitler has become a dictator legally albeit through trickery and violence please read william shirers book the rise and fall of the third reich for details its well documented as a historical work
socialism,not_removed,you have to understand that youre dealing with a way of thinking most of the times not with an informed opinion and a way of thinking is not permeable to evidence in fact evidence will likely make it stronger you have to question their way of thinking to make them doubt themselves
socialism,not_removed,httpunitedchansorgsocialismhasneverworked
socialism,not_removed,if you strive for perfection you will always fail by definition socialism has not always failed its simply failed to be perfect many countries have tried some socialism with fantastic success cuba has managed to achieve some of the best healthcare and education in the third world if you judge cubas success against the challenges it has faced it is remarkable but it has had failures as well that doesnt mean that socialism always failed in cuba just that it has failed to achieve utopia in a mere years not yet achieving utopia is hardly a failing similarly the nhs in the uk is hardly without its faults but its mere existence along with the new towns projects show that socialist ideas can be a success even in a largely nonsocialist society
socialism,not_removed,it doesnt matter if it failed in the past they key is to find a way to make it work because in the end dont most people agree that socialism has good ideals
socialism,not_removed,if thinking nation states it wont work and never will smaller initiatives will work as long as participants can optout imo smaller initiatives can and will grow and form larger coops that eventualy replace nation states lead by example
socialism,not_removed,you could argue that capitalism has failed time and time again if not for state intervention it would have died generations ago therefore what exists today isnt free markets and what it is only exists because of government action i know its a fallacious but what about you argument but its an argument you could also argue that unlike capitalism socialism has not only emerged out of less that ideal preexisting conditions dictatorship war foreign occupation civil war its also been forced to survive under seigelike conditions of outside hostility and subversion bad soil and bad weather
socialism,not_removed,imo the socialisms never been allowed to work argument just makes it sound like the persons whining about it
socialism,not_removed,ive always felt that despite what they may have claimed the soviet union generally pursued nationalistic goals rather than socialistic ones in order to have working socialism as we understand it the society must be democratic the soviet union was born from a country that had been an autocratic empire for centuries the prc too millenia of imperial rule in chinas case these nations have never had a tradition of democracy and without democracy a nation cannot be socialistic my point basically no one claims the democratic peoples republic of koreas failings are democratic so why assume the failing of the union of soviet socialist republics would be socialism
socialism,not_removed,first of all there is already plenty of information available that refutes this silly argument second of all depending on who says it if it is the edgy anarchocapitalist or libertarian type of person then i would not even bother convincing them socialism is not for them they are too invested in their point of view they will not listen to reasonable arguments in favor of socialism and will dismiss everything right away
socialism,not_removed,capitalism is still around so far im not going to be flaunting any success
socialism,not_removed,to be fair the same people who hate hearing socialism has never worked and will never work repeated again and again are the same people who themselves love repeating social democracy voting reformism has never worked and will never work again and again just saying
socialism,not_removed,honestly op im not really sure what youre asking a quick google search can probably find a whole list of crushed leftist movements the paris commune and anarchist catalonia are probably the best examples
socialism,not_removed,corporateocracy is what i fear
socialism,not_removed,i would check out homage to catalonia by george orwell i read it a few weeks ago orwell served under poum a marxist workers party and his description of barcelona when first arriving is an amazing description of how a burgeoning socialist society might look unfortunately this movement was repressed by stalin who supported the communist party instead

socialism,not_removed,hi i love the idea of socialism i love its philosophies the problem i see is that socialism requires no one takes advantage to not take advantage youve got to be a believer in the system if youre not a believer in the system it makes it easy to take advantage this is where socialism fails in my opinion the only way to stop this hijacking is to rule ruthlessly which in turn means less individual fornot an idea im comfortable with the truth is all forms of government and nongovernment are broken and can be used by unscrupulous people i think we need a blend of philosophies to make a fairer world im happy to be corrected if im wrong but i think all philosophies fail to take into account the human urge for greed and beating the system ultimately some people want to be at the top of the pile and thatll never change
socialism,not_removed,why worry about it theres a saying that is something isnt a problem until it is that applies to capitalismnobody will admit its a problem until it is and at that point we probably wont have many options left the human species is a herd running directly toward a cliff i think it is a waste of time to try and convince them not to be you will win the argument but it might be too late when you do
socialism,not_removed,i usually go with edmund burkes argument that the french revolution proved democracy was impossible
socialism,not_removed,socialism worked just fine in sweden for years now
socialism,not_removed,also every military dictatorship propped up by imperialist powers every former imperial power succumbing to fascismfar right nationalism and every man woman and child sleeping on the streets or struggling with food insecurity in countries with plenty of food and housing to go around want to see capitalism failing humanity in real time go out on the streets of any major american city and youll see people begging for spare change living in boxes and sleeping bags in filthy alleyways and the rest of the population is so accustomed to this deplorable state of affairs that they walk right past without a second look if thats not a sign of a deeply dysfunctional society i dont know what is
socialism,not_removed,there are also a ludicrous amount of failed democratic capitalist states that no one ever talks about
socialism,not_removed,capitalists counter argument recessions and depressions is capitalisms method to weed out bad businesses and assets i hear that a lot
socialism,not_removed,not to mention poverty and wars being otherwise the norm
socialism,not_removed,fyi that isnt actually going to convince anyone who isnt already a socialist
socialism,not_removed,except capitalist economies rebound and fix the problem id be interested in seeing a socialist economy thats recovered and become stronger after a depression
socialism,not_removed,the counter revolutionary forces fighting the development of the socialism are just as important if not more important than the revolutionary forces themselves in regards to the success of the revolution or establishment of the socialistleftist state i we need to be looking at the policies within our modern power structures that combat revolutionary ideas im talking about cointelpro i am talking about the cuba embargo i am talking about the incessant antisocialist propaganda over the previous decades the political and military interventions in leftleaning developing countries by capitalist powers official censorship of academics and activists the degradation of democracy all over the world as a matter of official policy and so much more
socialism,not_removed,also more importantly than handwaiving past socialist experiments as not actually socialism and in truth they werent we should analyse what went wrong and what went well this is what distinguishes a socialist and communist from a liberal poseur critically analyzing the socialist experiments from the century is an important exercise
socialism,not_removed,ill put it in the historical posts section
socialism,not_removed,yes i would love a spot in the wiki to counter the extremely illinformed agruements against socialism
socialism,not_removed,someone on here tried to tell me that americas capitalism could withstand multiple embargos cuba couldnt because socialism
socialism,not_removed,and the way they collect death tolls for communism is terrible for example million people died when nazi germany invaded the ussr liberals somehow like to attribute that to stalin well what the fuck do you want to do when fascists invade your country send them a fruit basket ffs also the nkvd leader was a fascist sympathizer who was a corrupt piece of shit who was later executed also for the great leap forward they use the decrease in births to attribute deaths to mao so people that are not even born or in the womb are some how killed thus giving mao an obscene amount of deaths also they fail to take into account other factors like lying about harvests which is not maos fault and bad weather
socialism,not_removed,i always like to compare what the ussr did in eastern europe to what the us did in latin america they both were basically the back yards of their closest super power and i gotta say that i would much rather have lived in the ussrs back yard than in the uss also i really cant wrap my head around the fact that many people think that stalin singlehandedly killed million people the soviet union had a population of million people in
socialism,not_removed,during the russianjapanese war russia borrowed money to fund the war similar to how the usa borrowed money to fund the war in iraq the russians went far into debt again similar to the usa in the years after the war in iraq this was in the bolsheviks began to revolt hopefully there is a pattern here
socialism,not_removed,thanks it is my shame for not knowing this already my partner is basque
socialism,not_removed,many of which dramatically raised the standard of living in a very short period of time this just sounds like social democracy but none of them are true socialism because they did bad stuff while fighting for their existence thats a strawmen other than naive sanders supporters nobody says socialist countries wereare not socialist because they did bad things we say it because these examples retained commodity production money wage labor the valorization of capital exchange and the nation state
socialism,not_removed,considering the ussr existed for years after stalin and spent those moving as far away from him as possible and that stalin wasnt widely considered the leader for most of the first decade it existed i think its absurd to say that the ussrs failures were all because of stalin
socialism,not_removed,well in south america it was at least moving towards socialism in many cases my point is that even the leftleaning state capitalism failed not because it was bad in some way but because the usa et al came in and crushed it and yes stalin and mao have really made any topic about any form of success in socialism very difficult indeed
socialism,not_removed,i think we are succumbing to liberal ideology by uncritically dismissing stalin as the singular tyrant that he is seen as in the popular mind its absurd to lay the blame of every single mistake made at his feet and is just an inaccurate view of how the ussr system actually worked i think its telling that russians today have a relatively positive few about stalin
socialism,not_removed,as its put in a documentary about marx that i frequently watch stalin did more to harm the cause of international socialism than all of its enemies combined
socialism,not_removed,or the john lewis partnership in the uk
socialism,not_removed,thanks
socialism,not_removed,fred hampton is an even more amazing example when you consider who they didnt kill huey newton eldritch cleaver served fbi purposes just fine alive and leading the black panthers nowhere even if they might have been breaking the law they killed fred hampton because he was so good
socialism,not_removed,thank you for your response to my question first one i have read yet i knew some of those already others not i will look into them thank you
socialism,not_removed,years i wish
socialism,not_removed,i wish i was that optimistic
socialism,not_removed,nothing is stronger than an idea whose time has come socialisms time simply hasnt come yet but it will look at the nordic countries they are leading the world and will lead it into socialism
socialism,not_removed,really if its a friend saying this they could do with some education on the matter but if its someone attached to a profitmaking enterprise its simply crude ahistorical procapitalist propaganda and very tired and boring propaganda at that this
socialism,not_removed,excellent thank you
socialism,not_removed,best website thanks
socialism,not_removed,heck liberalism failed its first couple times too napoleon came out of the french revolution like stalin came out of the russian
socialism,not_removed,in the usa you have the constant infiltration and disruption by the fbi my point is to document how the current and past capitalist powers in the world have used their power to make sure that any attempt at socialism will not succeed
socialism,not_removed,what exists today isnt free markets what daytime period did we have free markets
socialism,not_removed,often times it is difficult to find the inside story the unofficial history that is not cleaned for public viewing it is possible but generally you have to know where to look i was looking for sources to good information about crushed movements or sources relating to the idea that it is defacto official policy for the usa to crush such movements
socialism,not_removed,i made it about half way through it and had to put it down i got so bogged down in who was who in all of the infighting and i got so lost the whole thing lost meaning my version of the book had entire appendixes trying to detail who he was referencing most of the book
socialism,not_removed,the organisations you have listed are all so called socialized theyre collectively owned through the state if that is even considered to be a form of ownership but that is another discussion they are not democratically organized or perform a function that has equal value to all citizens class is still at play in them
socialism,not_removed,have you tried rsocialismvcapitalism that sub is more geared toward debate you can also try reading or wiki to see some counters to your complaints this sub is for socialists to talk about socialism just so you understand why you were downvoted this sub is not for countering arguments we have heard countless times before
socialism,not_removed,your comment might be deleted for reasons that have been explained but im really confused by what youre trying to say so ill jump in the problem i see is that socialism requires no one takes advantage what does this mean exactly can you elaborate i think we need a blend of philosophies to make a fairer world no offense this is badphilosophy or badpolitics you cant have a blend of political philosophies by its very nature it would be a different philosophy than its parts i think all philosophies fail to take into account the human urge for greed and beating the system ultimately some people want to be at the top of the pile and thatll never change i think this view is bollocks for a massive range of reasons pretty much every philosophy takes a view on human nature and how it interacts with a system into account its kind of the entire point of creating a working system but to add to this lots of capitalist philosophy and stirnerism relies entirely on the concept of psychological egoism youre not proposing any sort of new system here sorry
socialism,not_removed,my argument is not that socialism is undermined by capitalism it is a much bigger process than pinning capitalism vs socialism it is the modern power structure of the powers of the north and how they use their powers including their militaries to fight against revolutionary movements like the usa funding and arming a minority militaristic group in a country that democratically elected a leftist government is not capitalism beating socialism when the despot we install kills intellectuals journalists and activists it is not capitalism winning that is way bigger than just capitalism it is the consequence of a postcapitalist mindset of total world domination the way that the cards are stacked against socialism do not mean that socialism cannot win just that capitalism is stronger right now it does not give any justification to the capibilities of socialism its like trying to build a computer and having someone blow it up with explosive right before you turn it on computers can never work because they are so easily undermined by explosive doesnt make any sense
socialism,not_removed,its more of saying that they cant coexist the very nature of capitalism doesnt allow for any alternative as the profit motive necessitates that the market constantly expand and penetrate everything e ik youre an ancap and coming at it from a different perspective but youve kind of got it right in thinking that a socialist society will never exist so long as everything else around it is capitalist

socialism,not_removed,really you hit the nail on the head udocnedkelly is right about recessions being a failure of capitalism but we dont even need to wait that long we can see the failures of capitalism every time we walk outside every cold hungry human being who is forced to live in agony because they had the audacity to be born poor is an example of why capitalism is not only a failure but a morally bankrupt waste of time
socialism,not_removed,good point

socialism,not_removed,im not so sure with that as a starting point you can have a debate about how good capitalism actually is that is why do we support a system that effectively breaks every twenty years no one likes depressions or recessions there are very few people if any that talk about them positively so how is capitalism the best possible system if it breaks clearly there must be a better way to approach things that will prevent market corrections and even if you dont convince them of socialism being the best alternative you can at least get them critiquing capitalism thats a step in the right direction in my opinion
socialism,not_removed,the soviet union actually weathered the great depression much better than any other contemporary it ended up being a popular destination for american economic refugees for that very reason
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,an overwhelming amount of charities within capitalism still make some pretty big bucks theres incentive even in charity to skim of the top
socialism,not_removed,neither free markets nor profitmaking are inherently capitalist in a society in which the modes of production were owned by the people in coops for example there would be nothing at all wrong with them making a profit on the sale of their goods or services that profit would just be the property of the owners who would not have been alienated now im not entirely clear what you mean exactly by free markets but if you mean a market not regulated by a state its entirely possible that a society without a state and one which has a socialist system could by consent agree to a set of common practises in trade by that i mean that a group within an area could agree to a common market and then they could create a list of rules that all traders in the market must follow they would not trade with those who dont follow these rules which is much like the government regulates the markets today in theory but through consent rather than force there is thus no rule which says a socialist system cant have any regulated markets syndicalism would in fact be an example of how a stateless society could regulate some things voluntarily
socialism,not_removed,there was an author who researched the numbers of people killed in the ussr and upon his conclusion stated the actual number if surely at least twice this amount wtf
socialism,not_removed,south vietnam
socialism,not_removed,i went there years ago and the culture is impacted greatly by the cooperatives people there are so kind gender equality is amazing water is so clean they have public fountains where you can drink from nobody assumes youre gonna steal they dont even ask for your money at business or even at public transportation they assume you payed and you do my experience was great there i went to mondragon bilbao and vitoria its not perfect but is greater than what ive seen in nyc dc and even in madrid
socialism,not_removed,this just sounds like social democracy um what it sounds like a planned economy socialism arguably has more elements of that than does social democracy although both tend in that direction we say it because these examples retained commodity production money wage labor the valorization of capital exchange and the nation state yeah they werent communist in the utopian sense i dont really see how you can get rid of any of that after a devastating civil war for example followed by unrest famine ww ii and so on they were socialist in the sense that the means of production werent privately owned and they aspired towards communism
socialism,not_removed,which is pretty ridiculous when you consider that there have been just as many if not more bloodthirsty capitalists throughout history or did pinochet pahlavi and bautista just not exist
socialism,not_removed,mind if i ask what documentary that is
socialism,not_removed,no because each and every time people have used means other than the generic marxistleninist path to communism to reach their ends when youve had a successful revolution id imagine itd be kinda hard to break your ego down enough to do things by the book
socialism,not_removed,fred hamptons murder was an act of terrorism carried out by the fbi and ordered by hoover had he lived hampton would be just as well known and liked by the public as someone like martin luther king is just thinking about his murder makes my blood boil the pigs who killed him received medals and awards its disgusting because they should all be in prison for terrorism
socialism,not_removed,the nazis once they took power in the spring and summer of immediately began dismantling everything and anything that looked like democracy on may they held a may day celebration for the workers of germany and invited the leaders of the trade unions as well the nazis held the biggest rally for workers that germany had ever seen it was a complete fraud as goebbels wrote in his diary the very next day may they raided trade union headquarters all over germany and destroyed everything they murdered many of the leaders by arresting them and shipping them off to camps to be exterminated they rounded up thousands of organizers and killed them it was one of the greatest betrayals in the history of the labor movement on april hitlers cabinet created a law forbidding anyone with jewish ancestry from running a business in germany again thousands were rounded up and executed the conservatives in business were very happy at first when the labor movement was crushed but then became alarmed when the climate became unstable for business so ultimately it backfired the reich had to create million new jobs as they had promised but like so many other promises they did nothing and made no apologies when something went wrong like demand for goods going down because of a climate of fear and intimidation and police doing nothing about blatant murders in broad daylight in the streets the nazis simply blamed some other group for the crisis that they themselves had created after all part of the plan for hitler and his friends was to become insanely rich from taking control of everything it should be noted that hitler was a tax cheat who never paid his taxes in full nor did hindenburg who acquired a great deal of land from the french in but never paid a dime in taxes on those ill gotten properties hitler had an expensive car and a chauffeur during the time when all he had for his revenue as reported was the sale of his book mein kampf which came to no more than marks a year as before the war his book did not sell well at all he lived in a large house in southern bavaria in the mountains paid for by the nazi party hitler was a fraud and a scam artist and he was a malevolent monster who savagely murdered anyone who opposed him and the socialists communists trade unionists and even ultimately the center catholics and the conservative nationalists opposed him and he did away with all of them it should be noted that no real opposition was mounted because hitler has two private armies the sa and the ss and the reichwehr at this disposal once he took power as a dictator his armies controlled germany this is why the united states must never allow private armies or private militia to form and why we must be ever vigilant against people who rise to power on hate speech and false promises and we must never trust leaders who beat the drums of war
socialism,not_removed,glad to help my friend
socialism,not_removed,great fucking point damn
socialism,not_removed,not a perfect fit but id say the gilded age and even then wed have to ignore how the state helped capital with land grants low taxes little regulation and high tarrifs
socialism,not_removed,oh i dont have anything like that but im sure its not too difficult to find youre probably not going to find anything outside of socialist sources so that might hamper its credibility in the eyes of reactionaries in all honesty its every states de facto policy to crush socialist movements lest the plebes start to think they actually have rights
socialism,not_removed,my understanding is that the two appendices were originally published as regular chapters in the middle of the book but orwell later decided that they should be moved to the end and i agree the spanish civil war is fairly confusing i recently downloaded a but havent had a chance to start watching it yet i also have a copy of helen grahams the spanish civil war a very short introduction that im going to start reading this week
socialism,not_removed,op is asking for ways to disprove the socialism has always failed argument all he needs to do is point out that we are a socialistic nation its no longer a question of yes or no to socialism thats too simplistic the real question that should be asked at this point is where and to what extent everything that you said is true but ive found that pointing out practical applications of socialism in our society is a good way to give some people pause in some situations its not a silver bullet argument but sometimes in certain discussions in can be useful
socialism,not_removed,thanks i didnt know there was a debate forum i will add it too my subreddits
socialism,not_removed,hi i would be willing to discuss this further in detail but the above poster mentioned this isnt a place for this kind of debate i would prefer to respect the ideals of the subreddit is there perhaps a better place where we could discuss ideas that ive mentioned
socialism,not_removed,the most significant thing they ignore is that capitalism mandates that people must be on the bottom or the entire hierarchy collapses what happens to their comfortable middle class lives if the exploited workers on the bottom rung decide they dont want to sell their labour for cheap anymore or they all magically pick themselves up by their bootstraps like sympathisers say they should and become too good for the grunt work out of sight out of mind
socialism,not_removed,ive borrowed a few good points made in this thread over the months its a fantastic thread
socialism,not_removed,whenever someone brings up cuban refugees politely remind them about the littlementioned millions of refugees from centralsouth america and the caribbean fleeing the effects of capitalist and neoliberal policies
socialism,not_removed,yep capitalists always find excuses
socialism,not_removed,that is why do we support a system that effectively breaks every twenty years no one likes depressions or recessions there are very few people if any that talk about them positively because it seems to work pretty damn well in those years in between even those in the world who live in the direst poverty are being pulled out of it historically capitalism has been far more efficient than socialism in lifting people out of poverty right now in global inequality is narrowing at a faster rate than at any point in recorded history and the share of the worlds population living in poverty is continuing to fall at a dramatic rate no system is ever going to be flawless but most people are happy to accept occasional recessions if it basically works most of the time so how is capitalism the best possible system if it breaks if theres no better alternative then it is by definition the best system among the possibilities available and that takes you into the whole socialism vs capitalism argument which we obviously dont need to go into here
socialism,not_removed,got evidence would rlly love to read and send it to mah history prof
socialism,not_removed,in the us donating to certain charities gets you tax exemptions so theres an incentive and if you want to go to the conspiracy side to all of that billionaires make charities to get tax exemptions and then use those donations to increase profits for whoever donated in the first place say im a billionaire god forbid and start a charity to give medical aid to people in haiti my friend that has a company of medical supplies donates a couple million dollars and i buy those medical supplies exclusively to do my mission if i ever do the mission and my friend then gives me a return of that money say half or whatever
socialism,not_removed,they werent privately owned but they werent owned by the workers either the means of production were owned by the government really the party in the name of the workers this is where the term state capitalism comes from socialism and communism is about common ownership of the means of production and these states didnt have that some of them had minor forms of it here and there but nothing large scalewhether that was simply by necessity or by design is probably up to interpretation
socialism,not_removed,it sounds like a planned economy ok and massive corporations plan their production and distributiondoesnt make them socialist yeah they werent communist in the utopian sense so then whats socialism if you retain every single feature of capitalism since when did you even experience system change they were socialist in the sense that the means of production and werent privately owned so now the us postal office is socialist whatever the government does is socialist what are we now a mix of sanders supporters and fox news viewers
socialism,not_removed,we are conditioned to ignore or rationalize our own crimes everyone else who we other are the people capable of atrocity not us you forgot to add gw bush obama and many other us presidents to your list
socialism,not_removed,also the communist party has come second after putin during every election since the fall
socialism,not_removed,on youtube karl marx and marxism by stuart hall bbc docu
socialism,not_removed,great analysis thank you
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,no worries hopefully youll find some convincing arguments for socialism there
socialism,not_removed,also i would point out that if the leader was worth a damn his people would support him and be willing to fight against an uprising the people of chile democratically elected a communist government a couple of days later a military jet with an american flag on the side of it put a bomb through that presidents window there is a difference between fighting back and being destroyed thats not to mention the violent and nonviolent disruption techniques that governments use they are very difficult to counteract when a movement is searching for popular support and trying to organize themselves why are you referring to saddam as a socialist my argument is this a system should be able to withstand outside factors again to my computer with a computer would be good if it could resist being dropped or getting a virus it is not realistic to build a computer and expect it to be able to withstand the outside factor of someone strapping a brick of to it as for your argument about the cards being stacked against socialism right now id ask you why socialism didnt prevail when the ussr sat next to the us as the largest superpower in the world their status as a world superpower did not change the fact that the usa was killing people all over the world who were advocating for socialism and were waging a huge propaganda campaign against it misinforming and distracting people capitalism only needs a few informed actors the rest of the people are supposed to be obedient money making machines in socialism everyone needs to be in on it and understand whats going on it is really an uphill battle to come out of a system that produces drones to a system that produces informed self motivating citizens within the current state of capitalist domination a transition to socialism a perilous uphill battle easily fought and won by the strategically simpler capitalist system again none of this says anything to how actual socialism would function if it was the dominant ideology of the people outside of a capitalist societal context
socialism,not_removed,instead i would point to somewhere like north and south korea where the capitalist south is dominating the north in terms of economic productivity up until about the mid the north was actually far more productive than the south
socialism,not_removed,the people who fled cuba for the united states were the wealthy white landowners no shit theyre not going to like it when their workers take power back dont catch anything nasty licking bautistas boots by the way cuba has an equal life expectancy rate lower infant mortality and zero homelessness compared to the united states
socialism,not_removed,i figured so much thanks
socialism,not_removed,marxism and other ideologies based on emotions lol marxism is amoral it does not make moral claims
socialism,not_removed,you also need to leave the middle class somewhere to fall fear is a great motivator to keep people in their soulsucking jobs its part of maintaining the class system thats also the reason they fight things like welfare programs and single payer healthcare not having these things as a fallback makes things like exorbitant insurance payments seem easy in comparison the great american dream is the definition of this if you work hard and play by the rules you will make it to the top even though the odds say youd sooner win the lottery the unwritten companion to that is what will happen if you dont work hard according to capitalism you get what you deserve
socialism,not_removed,because it seems to work pretty damn well that depends on your definition of pretty damn well it doesnt work all that well for a large section of people already and then it catastrophically fails three to four times in a lifetime global inequality is narrowing at a faster rate than at any point in recorded history and the share of the worlds population living in poverty is continuing to fall at a dramatic rate correlation is not causation especially considering that your statement suggests that its narrowing even faster than when the world was dominated by laissezfaire capitalism of the late and early century no system is ever going to be flawless but the question at least gets people thinking about ways to reform it nothing is flawless but that doesnt mean you cant try to fix it which is my whole point even if the conversation leaves someone supporting capitalism they might at least still think that it should be reformed obviously as a revolutionary socialist i dont see that as ideal but its just the first step in the right direction
socialism,not_removed,yes magnet mountain by kotnik and behind the urals an american in russias city of steel by john scott the latter is especially good in this regard being a personal account of an american who left for the soviet union as an economic refugee
socialism,not_removed,zuckerberg skirted a lot of tax by donating it to his own charity that he controls i believe
socialism,not_removed,charity is another example of how capitalism fails to help the most needed it does nothing to help the problem of poverty in the first place and only creates a dependency on the charity income
socialism,not_removed,i mean components of capitalism that are not separate from it i was unclear about what free market actually meant for the reasons you mentioned
socialism,not_removed,but they werent owned by the workers what does that mean like market socialism where workers are the shareholders yeah no they werent socialism and communism is about common ownership of the means of production and these states didnt have that what is common ownership again and at which point does it become possible and desirable i agree the ideal is democratic production but thats communism and none of these countries had communism they had socialism if we define socialism as a stateled effort at achieving communism
socialism,not_removed,and massive corporations plan their production and distributiondoesnt make them socialist planned economy refers to the entire economy ie replacement of market mechanisms with scientific ones how do you not know this so then whats socialism well in that historic period it is very decidedly a stateled effort at achieving communism in the soviet case if were going to be cynical trying not to get obliterated from without and within which is what mainly influenced soviet decisionmaking during most of its existence if you retain every single feature of capitalism since when did you even experience system change but they didnt the central characteristic of capitalism is the existence of a market and private property lenin introduced market mechanisms was he also not a socialist according to you he was pressured by the realities of the historic moment to do so it was a mistake though and was corrected by stalin so now the us postal office is socialist whatever the government does is socialist what are we now a mix of sanders supporters and fox news viewers again no the means of production being socialized refers to all means of production for the record i dont think that the existence of public roads means were living in a communist utopia
socialism,not_removed,true i mean clinton straight blew up a childrens hospital because he thought there were weapons in it of course america can never do anything wrong because freedom
socialism,not_removed,t r i g g e r e d
socialism,not_removed,so what happened to the north why did it weaken was it the decline of the ussr mind you i should probably do research but i have a lot of things to research atm p
socialism,not_removed,could the view of the american dream as being an inevitability given the right economic backdrop laissezfaire bollocks be considered to be nothing more than a form of just world fallacy
socialism,not_removed,that depends on your definition of pretty damn well it doesnt work all that well for a large section of people already and then it catastrophically fails three to four times in a lifetime sure i accept that but i think i offered some pretty good reasons for my view and i think you can look at the historic rises in living standards for those across those countries that have adopted capitalism to see evidence for that assertion chinas mixture of protectionist trade policies and market system has allowed for historically unprecedented increases in the living standards of the poorest in china it seems very bourgeois to me to see this as a bad thing one could argue that this comes at the cost of those in the poorest countries but it is not a zerosum game and as i said it is clear from any reading of the publiclyavailable international statistics that global inequality is narrowing at an unprecedented rate and that the poorest are seeing continuous significant rises in their living standards yes you do get recessions but government intervention can help minimise the pain these cause and in the periods inbetween most people benefit greatly but the question at least gets people thinking about ways to reform it nothing is flawless but that doesnt mean you cant try to fix it totally agree with you here its important to always maintain a critical approach to things we oughtnt take the systems we exist within for granted or presume their legitimacy
socialism,not_removed,gave it my best shot what can you do
socialism,not_removed,what does that mean like market socialism where workers are the shareholders yeah no they werent no its more like a cooperative the workers all have an equal say in the business as long as theyre a part of it there are no shares to be bought or sold your stake in the company is based solely on the fact that you work for itand therefore have a say in how it should be operated and at which point does it become possible and desirable it becomes possible only once the workers have ousted the capitalists from the businesses and factories and taken over for themselves from the perspective of the working class its always desirable the interests of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat dont intersect so letting them represent us either through political representation wage slavery etc is detrimental as theyll never be able to do anything to help us unless its a temporary measure to assuage a revolt but thats communism and none of these countries had communism no communism is a stateless society democratic production is an ideal shared by all socialist ideologies regardless of their positions on the existence of the state they had socialism if we define socialism as a stateled effort at achieving communism thats certainly what lenin defined socialism as and most communists see it that way too but as an anarchist i reject the notion that the state is capable of leading anything but oppression their hearts are in the right place and ill always be sympathetic to them but even a socialist state will fall victim to corruption and power lust either through comrades losing their way or because opportunistic parasites maneuver their way into power
socialism,not_removed,planned economy refers to the entire economy ok since when did i dispute this i was trying to tell you theres nothing inherently socialist about planning central or otherwise i mean im pretty sure the nazis mustve implemented certain planning mechanisms for instance and i dont think anyone here would argue that they were socialists stateled effort i now see the problem the state and the people are not one in the same technically modern china is socialist by your definition the central characteristic of capitalism is the existence of a market and private property um no both features existed under feudalism and slave society they are certainly defining features of capitalism but they arent what comprises its very base what comprises capitalisms base is the existence of capital which was not replaced by the soviet union in any periodunder lenin you had the nep under stalin the ussr exported grain to other countries for profit and after stalin firms were expected to make profits to fill the states coffers was he also not a socialist sure he was a socialist but he also explicitly said that he had formed state capitalism under the new soviet union this isnt to forget that he and the bolsheviks took away power from the few surviving worker movements in the soviets to hand it over to the state again no the means of production being socialized refers to all means of production so the difference between socialismtm and capitalismtm can be gauged on a sliding scale by this logic social democrats arent wrong in thinking scandinavia functions so well because they have a mixture of socialism and capitalism also state ownership of the means of production inherently implies that the mop have not been socialized in this case the mop are still preserved for a particular identity and protected by force against the general publicnot that much different than private property imo this isnt to forget that if you define socialization as the state owning everything we must then concede that fascism is in technicality socialist
socialism,not_removed,i was off on my facts i remembered hearing that it was us planes that bombed the presidental palace in chile in it was in fact just nixon who ordered the cia to do everything in their power to stop allende from becoming president when they failed they crushed the economy of chile over the next three years and backed the coup that drove allende to suicide which inserted one of the worst dictators ever known to the region pinochet again bad facts on my part sorry i hope it is clear now edit they were but anyway i agree that the us coming along and taking someone like saddam out of power is not capitalism beating socialism instead i would turn to capitalisms self sufficiency and socialisms habit of dictatorship and collapse how was i supposed to understand that computers arent meant to withstand and local revolutionary movements arent meant to withstand powerful foreign military superpowers aiding in the fight against them i think the analogy is apt mao killed a lot of people that does not change anything about the united states action
socialism,not_removed,mostly yeah a decline in ussr aid due to increasing economic liberalization plus the rok got a ton more economic aid from the west around the same time i think there were probably some factors from inside the dprk as well but idk enough about their history to say
socialism,not_removed,its not a form it is just world fallacy thats what laissezfaire capitalism is built on the idea that everything works out well just because of course when you point out the multiple ways where people are screwed you get the response of well life isnt fair
socialism,not_removed,no its more like a cooperative the workers all have an equal say in the business as long as theyre a part of it ok but how is production coordinated i mean you do realize how extremely complex the economy is a factory is not an isolated system who allocates the capital how do they determine how much of what to produce and at what quality what goes where you either need a market or a central planning agency im afraid it becomes possible only once the workers have ousted the capitalists from the businesses and factories and taken over for themselves some kind of a spontaneous workeruprising is a fairy tale it would fail to organize be crushed by capitalists be crushed by foreign powers be smothered through economic sanctions fall apart because no coordination from the perspective of the working class its always desirable yeah but this is where you really start to see the difference between the ideal and actually getting there because you cant get to the ideal overnight i would surely like if we all woke up one morning in a stateless classless moneyless democratic society and lived happily ever after as flourishing individuals but that aint happening because power structures so while the endgoal of our desires might be the same i think my way of getting there is much more realistic i mean you literally dont have one you have a fairy tale which if i may psychoanalyze is a reflection of your resignation towards the proletarian revolution thats tongue in cheek dont take this seriously no communism is a stateless society democratic production is an ideal shared by all socialist ideologies regardless of their positions on the existence of the state thats what i meant semantics thats certainly what lenin defined socialism as and most communists see it that way too but as an anarchist i reject the notion that the state is capable of leading anything but oppression refer to what i wrote about getting there previously and i would agree the state is an instrument of class oppression currently of oppression of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie but as lenin wrote in the state and revolution the proletarian state would exist to oppress the capitalists they dont just disappear over the night you see but even a socialist state will fall victim to corruption and power lust either through comrades losing their way or because opportunistic parasites maneuver their way into power i am very afraid of this too we have more than enough examples of it happening this is one of my main practical concerns with mlm yet i dont know a better alternative
socialism,not_removed,since when did i dispute this implicitly by comparing it to a massive corporation which is a term applicable only to market economies ie largely nonplanned ones i was trying to tell you theres nothing inherently socialist about planning central or otherwise i mean im pretty sure the nazis mustve implemented certain planning mechanisms for instance and i dont think anyone here would argue that they were socialists i would disagree the nazis collaborated with the bourgeoisie and industrialists state power and capitalism go hand in hand centralizing the means of production in the hands of the representatives of the proletariat with the aim of achieving communism is definitely socialist read the manifesto again this is almost a wordforword recipe by marx engels i now see the problem the state and the people are not one in the same the state is an apparatus for ensuring the dominance of one class it is not even in the same category as the people so im not sure how you can compare them however the state can be oppressing either the bourgeoisie or the proletariat and a socialist state tries to do the former thats called the dictatorship of the proletariat im starting to think you havent read your marx technically modern china is socialist by your definition what no the state is strong and totalitarian but it is very much a marketoriented country one of the most so what comprises capitalisms base is the existence of capital which was not replaced by the soviet union in any period that was one of my points though you cant jump from feudal society to full communism just with pure faith no matter how much you theorize the material situation of the society exists as it does thats why i say the governments were socialist ie they had a communisticsocialist tendency but they couldnt truly solve concrete issues in order to achieve communism under lenin you had the nep under stalin the ussr exported grain to other countries for profit and after stalin firms were expected to make profits to fill the states coffers yes the nep was thought to be a necessity you cant wish communism and a good industrial base into existence especially not after a devastating war where like tens of millions of people died and many more were sick etc if you want to find out why it was necessary i really suggest you listen to this podcast its amazing so the difference between socialismtm and capitalismtm can be gauged on a sliding scale im sorry im not sure how you got this from what i said i said the complete opposite its not socialism if the means of production arent socialized all of them also state ownership of the means of production inherently implies that the mop have not been socialized in this case the mop are still preserved for a particular identity and protected by force against the general publicnot that much different than private property imo again we get back to this central question how would you have the mop controlled what is the opposite of state ownership this isnt to forget that if you define socialization as the state owning everything we must then concede that fascism is in technicality socialist dude what
socialism,not_removed,human nature is the biggest cop out argument that is nearly impossible to define in concise language so using it as a basis for any sort of criticism or support is absolutely unfounded i said triggered because muh human nature is brought up without fail when the pool arguments against leftist ideology runs dry
socialism,not_removed,well life isnt fair easy response so lets make it fair
socialism,not_removed,ok but how is production coordinated i mean you do realize how extremely complex the economy is yes i do hence why its up to each cooperative to decide how best to conduct business itll obviously vary based on the industry and the structure of where they work there are plenty of ways to do i personally like the idea electing recallable officers who handle the daytoday minutia but thats just my personal preference a factory is not an isolated system who allocates the capital how do they determine how much of what to produce and at what quality what goes where like i said above thats completely up to them the system is democratic for a reason no one knows where work is most needed than the workers themselves you either need a market or a central planning agency im afraid debatable but im not really opposed to either if a system doesnt work replace it with something else if market socialism or a planned economy is the only thing that ends up working then go with it some kind of a spontaneous workeruprising is a fairy tale while you raise good points its insulting to call it a fairy tale yes it would require a lot of work and probably an overarching authority of some type but just because something is hard doesnt mean its impossible change is never easy nor should it be yeah but this is where you really start to see the difference between the ideal and actually getting there because you cant get to the ideal overnight entirely true this is why im an advocate of evolving with the needs of society so while the endgoal of our desires might be the same i think my way of getting there is much more realistic i mean you literally dont have one you have a fairy tale which if i may psychoanalyze is a reflection of your resignation towards the proletarian revolution thats tongue in cheek dont take this seriously i dont think i saw what your way of getting there was what do you suggest not trying to be smug actually curious thats what i meant semantics i disagree socialists are diverse many of us might share the same goals but we shouldnt act like our differences are minor ones we need to accept that there are fundamental differences among different movements and work towards bridging the gap rather than just pretending everyone else is too naivestubborn to follow true socialismtm i am very afraid of this too we have more than enough examples of it happening this is one of my main ideological concerns with mlm yet i dont know a better alternative i suppose that depends on what you mean by better the soviet model has proven itself unsustainable almost always falling into state capitalism wherever its introduced and while i personally dont think the soviet union were the worst socialists who ever socialisted i do think their system had many fundamental errors that would have to be corrected for a socialist state to actually be viable and actually be in the hands of the working class also i feel the need to point out that marxismleninism is different from orthodox marxism in a number of respects lenin even said on multiple occasions that his system was unique to the feudal conditions of russia as marxism was built on the idea of the urban proletariat which tsarist russia didnt really have actual marxism as conceived by marx has never been attempted on a large scale so theres no saying whether it would really work but its as good an alternative as any
socialism,not_removed,yeah thats usually what i say but ive been thinking a bit about it recently the way ive started to it though is that life is actually pretty fair its not capable of being anything else everyones born different but no ones inherently better than anyone else that comes from the system and culture youre born into theres nothing about life that says you should be higher up just because youre smarter more athletic betterlooking straight white etc thats how society is divided in other words life is fair its the biases of humans that makes it seem unfair
socialism,not_removed,weve spent millenia trying to make it more fair why should we stop here
socialism,not_removed,sorry for the late response yes i do hence why its up to each cooperative to decide how best to conduct business but what type of decisions would they be making how is that not a classic market economy like i said above thats completely up to them the system is democratic for a reason firms are not isolated or independent they dont have their own capital they are not producing for themselves they are producing for others needs thats a necessary consequence of a complex economy no one knows where work is most needed than the workers themselves again they have two things they could follow external demand or external command debatable well first its not an eitheror situation its usually a mix so youre arguing either for a market tendency or a command tendency but im not really opposed to either it seems to me you dont really have a very concrete vision of how this system would function entirely true this is why im an advocate of evolving with the needs of society here i obviously agree i dont think i saw what your way of getting there was what do you suggest not trying to be smug actually curious well let me backpedal a bit and say that i am still studying and dont know too much to have a very firm opinion but im leaning towards ml dictatorship of the proletariat and command economy so that means gradual centralization of the economy in the hands of a socialist government headed by a communist vanguard party however we would need a better political system in order to avoid inhumane behavior by the state etc we would also need advanced planning methods which were problematic to implement in the ussr because of politics i disagree socialists are diverse many of us might share the same goals but we shouldnt act like our differences are minor ones we need to accept that there are fundamental differences among different movements and work towards bridging the gap rather than just pretending everyone else is too naivestubborn to follow true socialismtm i agree with this what do you think our disagreement is the soviet model has proven itself unsustainable thats debatable they had tremendous achievements first of all improved material conditions through industrialization and improved literacy rates then they had one of the most destructive wars in history the russian civil war which killed tens of millions and ruined a huge amount of transportation facilities left the population to deal with famine and disease then you had enormous famines which were always a problem there but were intensified with bad policy all in all i think we need to separate individual bad policy decisions and the framework in which they worked i do think their system had many fundamental errors that would have to be corrected for a socialist state to actually be viable and actually be in the hands of the working class such as not trying to be smug either i want to learn more about this also i feel the need to point out that marxismleninism is different from orthodox marxism in a number of respects lenin even said on multiple occasions that his system was unique to the feudal conditions of russia as marxism was built on the idea of the urban proletariat which tsarist russia didnt really have well if i understand it correctly lenin added crucial clarifications on the role of the state in the revolution and also expanded the scope of marxism to include imperialist tendencies which marx didnt deal with much those seem quite general problems relevant everywhere sure the actual politics wouldve been different in germany than in russia but theoretically i dont see why it shouldnt apply so i would need you to expand on this point when and why did lenin say that actual marxism as conceived by marx has never been attempted on a large scale so theres no saying whether it would really work but its as good an alternative as any how do you attempt marxism tho
socialism,not_removed,but what type of decisions would they be making how is that not a classic market economy their decisions would be whatever was in their best interests everyone will naturally work for what they want which will require compromise to achieve anything which benefits the working class as a whole as well as individuals its not a market economy because no decisions are left up to the whims of the economy itself any and all decisions are made by the workers socialism means having a democratically managed economy similar to a planned economy but more fluid and representativeie no fiveyear plan made by elite party bureaucrats firms are not isolated or independent they dont have their own capital they are not producing for themselves they are producing for others needs thats a necessary consequence of a complex economy in a globalized capitalist economy yes in a socialist society they are producing for the needs of the entire working class meaning themselves and the rest of society like i said the managing of the firm would be based on the whims of those inside it personally i like de leons idea of organizing into industrial unions but again thats just my preference theres nothing saying you cant gain resources from outside your community bartering and trade should be encouraged as long as it doesnt lead to massive disparities again they have two things they could follow external demand or external command postcapitalism assumes a postscarcity economy there is no demand because supply is unlimited this is admittedly a very utopian ideal but it helps to illustrate that supplyanddemand is a purely capitalist system socialism has no equivalent youre right in that theyre producing for the needs of society but considering that the workers themselves are the society theres nothing external about it theyre producing the things they know they and their neighbors need well first its not an eitheror situation its usually a mix so youre arguing either for a market tendency or a command tendency true im just interested in whatever system works right now everything im postulating is just theory changes would obviously have to be made for practical purposes but it at least gives a goal to work towards it seems to me you dont really have a very concrete vision of how this system would function i have my ideas but im open to others we have to avoid being complacent and assuming that everything we believe is correct if we cant evolve well just devolve another degenerated workers state well let me backpedal a bit and say that i am still studying and dont know too much to have a very firm opinion im fairly educated on the subject though id never say i know everything and theres still a lot left to learn but my beliefs arent set in stone either as you become more educated youll obviously develop stronger opinions on things but just remember to never assume that your beliefs are the only ones that could ever work but im leaning towards ml dictatorship of the proletariat and command economy so that means gradual centralization of the economy in the hands of a socialist government headed by a communist vanguard party however we would need a better political system in order to avoid inhumane behavior by the state etc we would also need advanced planning methods which were problematic to implement in the ussr because of politics how would avoid the political conflicts of the soviet union marxismleninism means youre going to have a vanguard party rather than a direct democracy how do you prevent this party from simply becoming a new elite class furthermore what would you do to stifle the internal politics of such a system i agree with this what do you think our disagreement is idk it just seemed to me as though you were saying we should just get over our differences and work together and while i agree with that sentiment its a lot more complex than that im sorry if i misinterpreted what you said and id be happy if you would correct me they had tremendous achievements first of all improved material conditions through industrialization and improved literacy rates at first yes hence why i said it wasnt sustainable their system proved very good at building an agrarian backwater into an industrial power disregarding the huge cost in lives that went with itwhether or not this was unavoidable is certainly debatable but in the longterm they showed that they couldnt adapt quickly enough to the needs of society politics interfered with good judgment and the fiveyear planswhile still stablecouldnt handle the needs of being the worlds second largest economy and it stagnated and fell apart as the soviets continued to not change the election of gorbachev was meant to counter this by bringing in much needed changes but the more reactionary elements of the party were so opposed that they attempted a coup which ultimately led to the dissolution of the soviet union entirely then they had one of the most destructive wars in history the russian civil war which killed tens of millions and ruined a huge amount of transportation facilities left the population to deal with famine and disease while this was definitely a problem i dont think you can really blame the civil war for the problems of latecold war russia considering the amount of time that passed but to give credit where its do lenins system and to a lesser extant stalins did do a lot to mitigate its effects though the war in afghanistan certainly didnt help anything then you had enormous famines which were always a problem there but were intensified with bad policy actually famines were pretty rare following the holodomer some people have even said it was the last famine in russian history though i dont know enough about russia to say whether or not thats true what i do know is true though is that hunger was never really one of the ussrs major problems in its twilight years and again credit where its due all in all i think we need to separate individual bad policy decisions and the framework in which they worked agreed such as not trying to be smug either i want to learn more about this well for one theres lenins idea of a vanguard party while understandable especially given russias lack of a large urban proletariat which is why lenin thought of it in the first place its completely counterproductive to building socialism because it creates the framework of a new elite class which we saw happen however its important to remember that virtually all of russias issue with communism came trying to build socialism in a feudal preindustrial society something marx explicitly warned against in his writings because socialism required the infrastructure of a postcapitalist society in order to function properly and many of the decisions lenin made reflected this such as the vanguard party and state control of industry really my biggest issue with marxismleninism is that its completely irrelevant in the modern age russia is now industrialized thanks ironically enough to ml and of the societies that arent they arent ready for socialism in the first place hence why im also against maoism lenins system wouldnt be necessary today because socialists should be focused on toppling the status quo of the industrialized world well if i understand it correctly lenin added crucial clarifications on the role of the state in the revolution and also expanded the scope of marxism to include imperialist tendencies which marx didnt deal with much thats true
socialism,not_removed,sorry had to break this into two those seem quite general problems relevant everywhere sure the actual politics wouldve been different in germany than in russia but theoretically i dont see why it shouldnt apply russia was feudal germany was industrial their needs wouldve been completely different mainly due to their differences in demographics russia was composed mostly of rural farmers many of whom could never be educated on the intricacies of socialist theory hence why marx termed them lumpenproletarians whereas germanys urban working class was susceptible to learn rendering a vanguard party unnecessary at least in theory since you still needed someone to teach the working classhow orthodox marxists intend to do this im not entirely sure its probably best to ask one of them so i would need you to expand on this point when and why did lenin say that the state capitalism which is one of the principal aspects of the new economic policy is under soviet power a form of capitalism that is deliberately permitted and restricted by the working class our state capitalism differs essentially from the state capitalism in countries that have bourgeois governments in that the state with us is represented not by the bourgeoisie but by the proletariat who has succeeded in winning the full confidence of the peasantry unfortunately the introduction of state capitalism with us is not proceeding as quickly as we would like it for example so far we have not had a single important concession and without foreign capital to help develop our economy the latters quick rehabilitation is inconceivable in fairness lenin did think that state capitalism would only be a temporary measure and that after a viable bourgeoisie was established the proletariat could take over and implement socialism to its fullest extant you can read the entire article how do you attempt marxism tho good question but again im not a marxist you should probably ask one of them if you want a straightforward answer since mine would probably be something snarky along the lines and thats why im not a marxist
socialism,not_removed,similarly rightwing aristocrats who loathed the notions of liberty and equality turned to nietzsche and stirner to support their sense of elitism and hatred of leftwing populism and massbased civilization i think it is important to point out how terrible of a misreading of nietzsche and stirner it is to use their philosophy to support mass based civilization it most certainly was done and an analysis of how this happened is welcome and important but nietzsche specifically spoke out against mass society civilization domestication etc and stirner was perhaps even more unequivocally clear in speaking out against such things that people took their words and misused them so explicitly in contradiction to what they actually said cant really be laid at their feet not any more than the protofascist group the proudhon circle can be laid at proudhons or dugin can be laid at lenins also to see novatore as passive nihilism seems like a complete misunderstanding of him i can see the expediency for mussolini to call him that but i hope were not citing mussolini as an authority on philosophical nihilism now also rampant misogyny of men like novatore what rampant misogyny are they referring to exactly and the validating of the claims of individualism of fascists here seems highly disingenuous did they claim that sure did they have a reasonable basis to claim that their ideology that demands obedience and tries to construct an authoritarian and violently imposed mass society was individualistic not at all i have to leave now but so far through chapter this seems like an ideologically motivated and spurious hit piece
socialism,not_removed,everyone in my area assumed it was an attack done by a muslim they most likely still do as news corporations just moved on to another thing
socialism,not_removed,definitely affiliate with a larger group
socialism,not_removed,prepare to get a lotta edgelords and no girls trying to join
socialism,not_removed,everything dwelve said but and this also extends to activities outside of school also start a workerowned cooperative enterprise theres no better way imho to fuse the imperatives of staying directly active and creating awareness and institutions that will be part of a more just future economy denormalize any economic discussions that do occur by boning up on all of the ways the nanny state is leveraged for the benefit of wellconnected firms most people are expecting the conversation for follow the typical false contours eg the market versus the socialism never fall into this trap a discussion about how common resources can be used by all cannot be had until we deal with the corporate welfare state you can quote the business press and even conservative organizations to make your case like professor chomsky does but again this is if and when you are drawn into conversations like that or when you find they are necessary or helpful
socialism,not_removed,lot of good pdfs and study guides at this link httpouleftspmesolitetiltednet it seems to me that your analysis of the extent previous socialisms were socialist will depend on your definitions i tend to go with revolutionary catalonia if im pressed to cite an example of socialism in action with respect to the soviet states obviously the people running them desired to eventually build socialism and these states had some socialist characteristics but in my book they werent socialist because there was insufficient worker control over the productive process for the case that bolshevism veered off the road to socialism early on in the revolutionary process see coming from this perspective of all the marxistleninist states yugoslavia came the closest to socialism
socialism,not_removed,the overdeterminist branch of marxism differs from classical marxist thinking in that it rejects the notion of ultimate causes as wolff says here traditionally marxists believed as engels that the economic base was the ultimate cause of everything in a society superstructure in the last instance
socialism,not_removed,if only anarchocapitalists and libertarians understood this concept in relation to the state
socialism,not_removed,fun fact the number one marxist influence on richard wolff is althusser
socialism,not_removed,i recommend his book contending economic theories neoclassical keynsian and marxian for people that havent read it he goes over this in the book as well as comparing those three economic theories
socialism,not_removed,but this is a form of determinism as the mode of production itself influences your life rather than your own free will
socialism,not_removed,yeah the quote is taken from that book
socialism,not_removed,overdeterminism doesnt claim that human will is independent of economic and social forces its still a materialist philosophy rather it just posits that the causes of the basesuperstructure cannot ultimately be any one thing classical marxism claims the economic base is the ultimate cause in the last instance of interdependence between all the various socialpoliticaleconomic forces

socialism,not_removed,sure the workers own stock in the company but many companies also have this same model albeit not to as large of a scale but that doesnt mean the workers have any real democratic control over their own workplace futhermore publix seems to be and have had to settle on lawsuits for discrimination of female employees
socialism,not_removed,progressive corporations the only progressive corporations are a lack of corporations
socialism,not_removed,helluva sub sandwich tho
socialism,not_removed,better examples as american companies go would be rei which is a consumer coop for outdoors recreation supplies or pcc which is a consumer food cooperative
socialism,not_removed,nonsense no company or firm is leftist they are all the territory of the bourgeois and are all our enemies

socialism,not_removed,arundhati roys book walking with the comrades about the naxalite rebellion currently going on in india is a a great book about the activities of communists guerrillas robin d g kellys hammer and hoe which is about the activities of the cpusa during the and in alabama is a fantastic book which covers those activities and the wider implications of them in the south during the great depression i highly suggest reading or finding pdfs of both of those books as theyre what i consider to be essential in learning about the struggle for a better world through communism
socialism,not_removed,i would suggest jared diamond i found the day before yesterday about huntergatherer societies very interesting and some of his other works seem directly relevant

socialism,not_removed,its not just about trying to reduce the waste but produce more sometimes is more eficient to give more energy to a machine instead of trying to reduce the waste of energy socialist of the world we must unite to identify what economical system is able to produce more comrades i think its capitalism based on empiric data and logic maybe is time to take a great leap backward

socialism,not_removed,i think its interesting how they go to such great lengths to appear respectable for instance parts of what they say about interracial porn dehumanizing black men could actually be straight out of a sociology textbook if they were read out of context they also were obviously at great pains to list the works of scientists and historians to back up what they say and jared taylor is even listed as a political scientist no real sources in the whole article whatsoever of course but these guys have a real good pr team

socialism,not_removed,the fear mongering in this article is ridiculous and the person who wrote doesnt seem to understand that not all forms of socialism have an authoritarian leaning political stance

socialism,not_removed,corbyn is a socdem milktoast but this lie about venezuela was ridiculous mr corbyn has lavishly praised the socialist rulers who have murderously ruined its oncehealthy economy a disaster whose cost is borne by the weak and vulnerable the left claims to champion i mean do telegraph writers consider an economy healthy if of people live in extreme poverty thanks to his almost comically misjudged support for uncontrolled immigration especially among labours traditional working class supporters again not a supporter of corbyn here but its funny how the telegraph writer cant even imagine that corbyn might not have misjudged his stance on migration but just took the position he deemed the morally correct one without following outright electoral opportunism
socialism,not_removed,its so in your face you may think its written by some socialist whos trying to make propaganda ineffective by writing intentionally ridiculous articles
socialism,not_removed,stalin did more damage to the socialist movement than any capitalist could this couldnt be more true in the context of the article millions of people around the world have a negative view of socialism and just interpret what it means based on stalins governance of the soviet union
socialism,not_removed,nuance whats that
socialism,not_removed,talks about the failure of venezuela but and i admit i dont know loads about the situation i thought america had basically fucked venezuela into most of its current problems which they tend to do with most weak countries that establish a left wing government

socialism,not_removed,i did a quick numbers calculation the us and its allies since the civil war up to the iraq war part ii has killed approximately billion people in the name of democracy and capitalism that is approximately people a year over the last years these numbers are just from wars alone not from any other causes of death linked to capitalism

socialism,not_removed,nope the brits never traded in millions of slaves nothing to see here just innocent buisness
socialism,not_removed,the person who wrote this understands perfectly
socialism,not_removed,and the person who wrote doesnt seem to understand that not all forms of socialism have an authoritarian leaning political stance when people write about socialism this way i can guarantee its most assuredly a conscious decision
socialism,not_removed,even though its communism people usually refer to stalins ruling and how he killed millions of soviet citizens so people basically say communism is exactly socialism so then they just think of stalin and his ruling in the soviet union people who say this usually dont understand the fundamentals of socialism really socialism shares similarities to communism but to a lesser degree is what i was taught edit just a disclaimer i am still learning things about socialism so i am still learning and understanding it if i am wrong please tell me and explain

socialism,not_removed,people talk about economies like theyre not abstractions because that helps mask ideology find a few metrics by which the economy of venezuela deteriorated under chavez and who gives a fuck about what people actually experienced also clever use of murderously there to imply that a socialist leader who was democratically elected and did not violently suppress dissent was still somehow a stalinesque monster
socialism,not_removed,socialist rulers democratically elected leaders
socialism,not_removed,if any capitalist country recovered economically the way that chavezs venezuela did in just a half a decade it would be called a miracle
socialism,not_removed,exactly too many times when ive had to defend my views the arguments been so would you want to live in stalins soviet union i cant imagine anything worse no of course not i wouldnt even call it socialist oh how convenient like come on that doesnt even make sense surely if im calling myself a socialist and that was socialist then i probably would want to live there but since i dont because its not its fairly safe to assume that it isnt i wouldnt be advocating something i didnt want

socialism,not_removed,estimates million deaths thanks to tobacco in the century it also says that in the biggest tobacco companies including chinas state corporation made billion profit gives an estimate that million people living in will die thanks to smoking and a projection of billion deaths over the course of the century i cant see the sources for the footnotes however httpwwwwhointtobaccomediaentobaccoexplainedpdf is also useful for direct evidence that tobacco companies knowingly lied about smokings health impacts funnily enough even though its clearly proven that tobacco companies deliberately missold their products and killed people by doing so legal actions against them have a habit of failing in the us the tobacco companies have been forced to cough up some cash but over here in the uk legal technicalities mean even that hasnt happened isnt it odd how companies can deliberately kill millions maybe pay a fine and just carry on its almost as if the legal system exists to protect their interests or something sorry if i got a bit ranty but i think the tobacco industry demonstrates that living in a western democracy wont stop capitalists killing you for pennies
socialism,not_removed,dont use sexist slurs and for the record im disappointed in all of you that this was upvoted so highly
socialism,not_removed,probably not though
socialism,not_removed,i dont know i think a large proportion of the media and rulers gave internalised it enough that they could write something like thin in good faith
socialism,not_removed,eh the term socialism is used in so many different ways in the left its always a challenge to try to decipher what is meant by it some use it to refer to a transitional state between capitalism and communism world state without nations scarcity hierarchical governments class differentiations etc others use it synonymously with communism some use it in place of communism some people dont even use it in relation to communism at all but to a society where the means of production are owned and controlled by workers not the working class as a whole and then of course we have the socialdemocrats who use it refer to welfare capitalism and the rightwingers who use it to mean devil worship tldr no one really agrees on wtf socialism actually means there have been countless arguments on this sub and among the left in general over this lack of a single good definition of the word
socialism,not_removed,the actual harm done by stalin to the soviet union and its people is largely exaggerated by bourgeois historians and thus overstated in the bourgeois media obviously the nkvd was repressive in some circumstances and his rule was not very democratic but most of the atrocities attributed to him eg the ukranian famine were not a direct result of his policies or are grossly sensationalized during much of his tenure the ussr was literally fighting a war of defense against proper fascists and many of his actions eg order no can be properly contextualized by that fact
socialism,not_removed,you arent wrong socialism is to communism what corporatism is to nationalism a little brother however even when people refer to the great purge and quote the figure of million killed which most people dont even know where that number comes from they are forgetting that in the ussr crimes such as rape and murder carried the death penalty and kgb statistics tracked all executions not just political ones i cant remember the source but i recently read that the number of purged people may have been as few as of whon the majority were simply forced out of the military or sent to prison only a very small minority of political dissidents were executed the number of executed might actually be similar to the number of communists executed in the usa in the though id need time to collate data to support this hypothesis
socialism,not_removed,its why speaking to most economists pisses me off they seem to actively avoid looking at the direct human costs of the policies they promote under the assumption that when numbers on a screen go up then so will the quality of life of people in that country
socialism,not_removed,milquetoast is the name of a comic character that was named after his habit to eat milktoast both can and do stand it as an analogy for a weak person

socialism,not_removed,ive noticed its been getting bad in rfullcommunism i wonder whats happened too many front page appearances im guessing catching some brocialists
socialism,not_removed,i can confirm that there is evidence to suggest that the ukrainian famine was fabricated by the nazi party or germany as anticommunist propaganda

socialism,not_removed,greens labor socialist alliance if they actually had a candidate in my area why this is probably the most important election in decades so many major policy programs will hang on the balance of this election gonski medicare nbn ndis unemployment support mental health funding environmental funding ir etc if the liberals win they will claim their mandate the media will go along with it because the media in australia will never seriously criticize the liberals and we will see the wholesale destruction of major programs and a huge crackdown on unions activists and environmentalists you only need to look at nsw to realize how far the liberals will go when they claim they have a mandate also the entire future of communications infrastructure will be decided saturday if the liberals win fiber will not be rolled out in australia in our lifetimes i honestly believe that
socialism,not_removed,in the senate the socialist alliance theyre multitendency socialists with a broad comprehensive set of policy theyre basically reformists but hey it is an election for parliament after all from my brief interactions with them their activists have seemed like switched on professional and capable types who wouldnt be too far out of their depth if they were to get in though i dont know their candidates specifically then preferences to ron paulsen and the sep progressive minor parties ahead of the greens because tactically id rather extra progressive crossbenchers than a bigger green block in order to extract more concessions though i might switch this around on the day greens decent minor parties labor left borderline alright minors labor right because fuck the red tories not totally terrible minors lnp terrible minors in the house greens independents labor libs wacky christians
socialism,not_removed,in light of the election if you want to see some quality liberal party bashing check out friendlyjordies on youtube
socialism,not_removed,id like to point out that this election is huge and since the revolution doesnt seem to be appearing its very important to get lnp out before they make irreversible damage environment healthcare media welfare etc i would personally put labor first not because i love them especially but a labor maj rather than hung parliament with minor lartiesindependents would be far better in preventing lnp influence and keeping policy relatively left but yes socialist alliance and greens have better policies note read about small parties the health party is actually antivaxx
socialism,not_removed,dont vote for independents they are literally all shit except ricky muir
socialism,not_removed,meh is there anyone salt dont have a hit piece on id rather judge each person on their merits than apply a blanket rule that theyre all right wing for some reason anyway given the choice id rather a centrist independent than a centrist labor party member at least the independent isnt bound by party discipline and can be pressured by their constituents
socialism,not_removed,australian politics if fucked if you dont recognise that all the options are shit right now then you are in denial of reality are we just meant to ignore the political faults of all the parties in australian politics i for one are for building a genuine socialist movement that could one day contest the electoral hegemony of the major parties is that not a better alternative to what we have now either way i disagree with your statement about centrist independents i would much have a centrist labor mp than an independent because the labor party has a working class constituency that can sometimes put pressure on it to do leftwing things as well as the pressure of unions those same pressures could exist for an independent who had their base in the unions or in a working class community but nobody like that exists in australian politics right now i dont know of a single independent right now who would be worth voting for in australia if you know any then please tell me because i would be pleased to hear of it
socialism,not_removed,its great and i advocate for it however i want to make sure i havent fallen for any propaganda its been pointed out to me that in a system like that the government would have to conserve resources when this happens resources would have to be rationed as an example if they had to choose between someone really old who needed a heart translate or someone younger who needed a heart transplant they would choose the younger one and the older one wouldnt get treated its basically a conservative argument that states that the government would be able to choose if you live or die or not in those situations there are not currently infinite supplies of replacement hearts replacement kidneys replacement livers etc as long as this remains a fact of life these commodities will have to be rationed out right now in the us the choices are generally made by the framework set up by the this basically boils down to parts of the dept of health human services making the deliberations essentially in the us right now without universal health care the government already decides who gets what organ there are obviously other services that may be rationed due to scarcity but using this as a criticism of universal health care assumes that the government wouldnt shell out more to remove the scarcity for example by removing the bottleneck on doctor training which currently artificially restricts the supply of doctors in the us and privatized health care isnt already rationing care which it is the only difference between a universal socialist health care and a privatized health care is that privatized health care has a primary motive of profit whereas universal socialist health care is driven by needs of the population guess which one is going to get better outcomes and if it isnt obvious to whoever you are argueingdebating with you can point to the many profit driven abuses and failures of the health care system in the us such as kicking people off their plans as soon as they get sick having treatment maximums being part of a cycle of skyrocketing healthcare costs due to complete unaccountability etc
socialism,not_removed,what makes the government a worse decider in that case than a private insurance company
socialism,not_removed,rationing in the manner of who gets treated first would be based on need emergencies before nonemergencies a nationalized system is accountable to the public rather than shareholders i favor a nationalized healthcare industry because of these things not simply medicare for everyone
socialism,not_removed,in places where universal health care already exists say canada or germany you can also buy private health insurance people who dont like the government system or feel they are likely to get shorted on a service can spend extra on private insurance that promises better treatment the essential thing is people have access to both preventive and emergency health care in addition to nutritional and mental health services this kind of universal access tends to drive overall health care costs down easier to nip disease in the bud this way medical training costs also tend to go down as the state subsidizes them in order to drive down overall health care costs by saturating the market with qualified professionals this benefits society overall in the form of healthier people and more efficient health care but it also benefits individuals who have no insurance or inadequate insurance and it benefits businesses who save on insurance plans if you look at the statistics the united states spends more per capita on health care then anywhere else but whats less known is that the united states spends more per capita government dollars on health care than any other nation except norway thats right more usa taxpayer dollars go towards healthcare per capita than anywhere else except wealthy ass norway yet the amount of people suffering from treatable diseases and the number of people who are uninsured are an embarrassment to the western world i hope it goes without saying that universal health care does not mean unlimited pharmaceutical drugs
socialism,not_removed,you can say the same thing for private healthcare cough cough who cares if it is the government or the enterprises that decides it still sint you or anything democratic so in these cases universal helathcare is best in the current system because that actually means people will survive another day
socialism,not_removed,ill give you an example of the sort of rationing that does happen and you can see if you have a huge problem with it or not httpswwwcadthcasitesdefaultfilespcodrpcodrolapariblynparzaocfnrecpdf these drugs are often quite expensive costing hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient and also tending to provide months rather than years of additional life on average so it can be a tough call whether or not that money might be better used elsewhere in the health care system here they decided not to for now because the clinical trial they were given didnt show that the drug provided much of a benefit
socialism,not_removed,if its universal then its offered for everyone and there is no rationing
socialism,not_removed,private insurance companies dont have to make those types of decisions do they am i mistaken
socialism,not_removed,if need outstrips supply then there is always rationing the only question is who or what mechanism is doing the rationing edit to add there is nothing inherently wrong with rationing its just frequently used as an anticommunist scare word
socialism,not_removed,why wouldnt they universal healthcare is called singlepayer for a reason the only thing that really changes is that the government does the job of all insurance companies i dont think this situation in particular falls to the insurer to make a decision i think organ transplants are handled by medical professionals generally but im not sure and im positive that some vital care decisions are made based on the economics of care that those decisions are currently made by private insurance company employees and that under singlepayer those decisions would be made by government employees which is why my answer to this criticism is a question what makes the government worse for these decisions than private insurance companies
socialism,not_removed,people just dont realize we already have lots of rationing under capitalism your supply of rations is your income the rich just dont feel the pressure of such rationing at all because they are given such a disproportionate amount
socialism,not_removed,yes in addition there are many instances where there is actually a profit motive to reduce supply or inflate demand and thus make rationing in the capitalist context rationed by money supply of individuals and therefor by the employers that deign to pay them actually more common in privatizationcapitalist heavy contexts for example in a natural context very few people would give two shits about owning diamonds but after massive quantities of marketing and propaganda most people feel like diamond rings are essential parts of engagementweddings thus leading demand to go up and price to go up not only this but at the same time companies involved in diamond miningcutting carefully restrict supply to create artificial scarcity and drive prices up even further now nearly everyone buys one of these stupid fucking rocks that have zero use aside from satisfying a ridiculous expectation manufactured by a marketing campaign lets look at this same commodity in the context of a state run market that isnt interested in profit motive difference nobody is pushing a market for diamonds into the public consciousness so the demand remains low where it should be for a relatively worthless material though obviously there are uses in terms of grindingcuttingetc and even in artjewelry it would be no where near what it is in todays society difference the supply would not be artificially restricted because there would be no profit motive to do so therefor even if we ended up all loving the shit out of diamonds the price would still remain low because supply would far outstrip demand
socialism,not_removed,i remember learning about this in an anthropology of race class a few years ago and i couldnt believe it at first scientific racism was bonkers in the and centuries another example of white people going through mental gymnastics to feel superior occurred in the late century when the ruins of the great zimbabwe empire were discovered in southern africa the european explorers simply could not accept the fact that black africans had built an advanced society with massive construction so they claimed it was actually the ruins of a civilization created by the queen of sheba from the old testament that theory was widely accepted by historians and archaeologists well into the century scary that the altright is all about their own version of modern scientific racism
socialism,not_removed,such a bizarre thing to believe would this imply that whites would be perfectly fine living as chattel slaves
socialism,not_removed,actually this cherrypicked study that fails to control for socioeconomics or anything else suggests that blacks have a lower iq on average so basically everything hitler did was okay and i have a dubiously sourced infographic from pol to prove it just dont ask me about their methodology or even what the actual abstract says i encounter those people so often that i can predict what they say before they say it
socialism,not_removed,scary that the altright is all about their own version of modern scientific racism it is scary i put up a video on revolution of stephen jay gould famous evobiologist who went after nutty sociobiologistsevopsychologists and racists and sure enough me and another gould sympathizer got attacked by some wacked out racerealist and his iq realist friend that thought goulds views were socialistic fortunately most professionals have little to do with such weirdos but it doesnt change the fact that racist thinking cloaked in pseudoscience is still pretty prevalent and altering the publics ideas on race
socialism,not_removed,theres also huge stone circles in south africa and even a stonehengelike calendar aptly named adams calendar that potentially dates back to the very early years of our species as modern humans but the mainstream has a hard time even wanting to accept this and wants to categorize the ruins as only being a few hundred years old despite weathering analysis even though the anthropologist studying this is a bit of a kook that believes the ruins were an annunaki settlement i highly recommend checking out his material research on the ruins which is rather solid and does prove these are older settlements the interesting thing is that if his conclusions on dates are correct this also verifies some of the more interesting parts of local mythologies about an advance civilization at least more advanced than the san and other tribes existing in the area in the deep past and it may also push back the dates on the first layers of the great zimbabwe ruins which should not be too surprising because humankind loves to build over inhabited settlements and if you want to look into something even more weird check out some of the theories regarding puma punku in south america yeah i have a thing for looking archeological anomalies and theories im well versed in both traditional and alternate theories
socialism,not_removed,an excellent book that rigorously traces the origin and development of american statistical racism after scientific racism failed to produce desired results data to objectively condemn blacks
socialism,not_removed,it suggests that the whites on the plantation both southern aristocrat and servant were on the same field as the slaves since out of all of the groups on the plantation only the slaves ran basically he says everyone is already in their rightful place and not all slaves tried to run so the minority that did must be suffering from some mental affliction this is just pre civil war secessionist pseudoscience
socialism,not_removed,it just seems like an insanely inconsistent idea even by century racist pseudoscience standards
socialism,not_removed,theres a reason why reactionaries lost most of there ground to liberals

socialism,not_removed,when conservatives actually dare to put the dog whistles away if only they could be this honest about all their political ideologies then we could finally have an honest debate in this country
socialism,not_removed,this is literaly a suggestion ive seen on rpoliticaldiscussion a few weeks ago
socialism,not_removed,seems a bit unnecessary if its a legitimate food stamp i think the womans body can just shut the whole thing down
socialism,not_removed,the republican party is a thin veil over all sorts of racists and hate ideologies this man wants to treat human beings of a different economic class like they are cattle he is not remotely fit to hold public office
socialism,not_removed,daily reminder that conservatives implicitly believe that human worth is quantified by the amount of value one can generate for shareholders and human dignity is something that has to be earned

socialism,not_removed,are you referring to arpaio because fuck arpaio
socialism,not_removed,id imagine if we entered some weird political vortex where everybody was free of the fear of expressing their true beliefs or if we were on youd probably find a very large majority of conservatives would not only not have a problem with enacting something like this but would actually go out of their way to support it
socialism,not_removed,rpoliticaldiscussion a sub infested with militant neocons and hillary worshippers is bad what a surprise
socialism,not_removed,its all neocons and right wing liberals they suck
socialism,not_removed,the one and only fuck arpaio
socialism,not_removed,is donald trump the vortex
socialism,not_removed,some very unorganized thoughts the national assembly had had an opposition majority since the last election and most leftists agree that the us had some part in that both via direct and indirect means now venezuela had been in a state of decline before then but obviously that election did weaken maduros government as to what happens next potentially the socialist party could use their now complete rule to actually do socialist things but thats far from a guarantee that venezuelas economic situation will improve i dont really have any confidence in maduro that such a thing will happen but who knows i can say with a bit more certainty in my mind that there will be a retaliation from the right in the country and theyll likely receive covert us support i dont think the us will make any direct intervention aside from levying new sanctions sorry for the jumble im rather scatterbrained at the moment
socialism,not_removed,venezuelan here you can ask me anything
socialism,not_removed,hope los roques is still ok
socialism,not_removed,will this move give the us the excuse theyve been wanting for a while now to invadedepose maduro
socialism,not_removed,how serious are the charges of election fraud against the three members of the na who were seated in defiance of the court
socialism,not_removed,get this fucking reactionary right wing propaganda off this subreddit at a time when the us is using stories like these to try and destabilize venezuela you even admit in another comment that you arent a socialist or a leftist at all
socialism,not_removed,i dont know if ive ever seen a prochavez venezuelan on reddit would you mind just giving your general opinion on the situation as a whole there
socialism,not_removed,invade no depose maybe im unsure of how much say the president gets in what the cia does but the current administration has a lot of hawks in it and getting venezuelas oil and other natural resources under the control of a puppet whod sell them cheap or allow us corporations to own the oil fields would obviously be beneficial to the uss interests and would be well in line with its past imperialist actions
socialism,not_removed,three members of the na who were seated in defiance of the court the goverment acussed a person of that entity they say she gave money to the voters by voting for opositions candidates but in the case that were true even if they received the money the vote is still secret if someone had paid you for voting against candidate a and you support candidate b which would you have voted for i would feel pretty great if i had received money and still vote for the candidate i support sorry if my english is not good enough im trying my best
socialism,not_removed,oh excuse me if i came out as prochavez im definitely not that on the contrary im totally against chavez and maduro and sadly i dont think youll find many prochavez people around a lot of them nowadays regret having voted for him and his successor maduro ill save my opinion to myself since i think most of the people here dont wanna hear any of it but one thing i can say for sure and i think you would agree on is why is maduro doing everything in his reach to not allow elections to take place hasnt he and his people claimed over and over how well the venezuelan people is doing and how much the people support them theyll definitely win with such massive support right
socialism,not_removed,was it proved that money was paid for votes
socialism,not_removed,youre damn right im instantly demonizing you for regurgitating right wing lies that have already been unmasked as just that if you want evidence you can look at the telesur articles or the comment at the top of this post but of course socialist news sources would be seen negatively to you there is always a proletarian line and a bourgeoisimperialist line to events like the ones taking place you have made it clear which one you support and we as socialists will continue to struggle against that line
socialism,not_removed,oh alright im sad to see so many socialists still defending chavezmaduro after all that has happened are there any socialists there that recognize the mistakes the government has made is there any real socialist movement as of now
socialism,not_removed,yes according to the goverment it was proved as a matter of fact the accused person was sentenced she was conditionally released and she cannot leave the country not a hard sentence to be honest
socialism,not_removed,telesur is paid by the government you are regurgitating more propaganda
socialism,not_removed,skeptical socialist well at least you dont hide the fact that you dont care about socialism
socialism,not_removed,well personally im not of socialist or leftist beliefs but yes there still are people that believe in socialism and recognize the failures of the chavezmaduro government as for real socialist momevents i do not know for sure but despite the chavezmaduro government calling out the venezuelan opposition coalition the democratic unity roundtable known as la mud as being part of the facist right or capitalist dogs and what not a lot if not most of opposition parties actually claim to lean themselves toward leftist ideologies center centerleft socialists communists and marxistleninists parties which have existed way before the chavez government came around and some were progoverment and at some point became opposition you can read more about them in the httpsenwikipediaorgwikidemocraticunityroundtable of la mud in english theyre listed in the member parties section and many of them have individual articles
socialism,not_removed,yes how dare i use left wing news to combat right wing lies s
socialism,not_removed,the fact that your comment has so many upvotes shows how far gone this sub is venezuela is not socialist and even if it was it is not exactly a country anyone needs to start defending
socialism,not_removed,chavez and maduro were not socialists at all social democracy in the third world isnt socialism
socialism,not_removed,so if youre not a socialist or a leftist why are we to act like your opinions on chavez and maduro are unbiased
socialism,not_removed,thank you
socialism,not_removed,they own the news channel of course they wont talk badly about themselves also that you dont accept something doesnt make it a lie
socialism,not_removed,i never said venezuela was socialist at this time thats not the point antiimperialism on the basis of who is ideologically pure or not is chauvinism
socialism,not_removed,tankies lmao that meaningless childish buzzword aside when will ultraleftists finally break with liberal ideology and understand that bourgeois elections with bourgeois parties is a bad thing and this isnt even the banning of elections the right wing party committed election fraud and got punished for it
socialism,not_removed,seriously some of the commenters need a dose of reality venezuela is not a nice place
socialism,not_removed,like how you added third world just to let everyone know youre a first world chauvinist also i never said venezuela was socialist at this point
socialism,not_removed,exactly thats why i said to him before ill save my opinion to myself since i think most of the people here dont wanna hear any of it yet he still asked me a question after that and so gave him an answer also if i were a socialist or a leftist wouldnt that also make my opinions on chavez and maduro biased my political stance is no secret but i tried to give him my perspective in the most unbiased way i can since i know the subreddit im commenting on and i respect your opinions and ability to think and be critical
socialism,not_removed,so what are you gonna support the dprk now because it is antiimperialist
socialism,not_removed,isnt that the opposite of ultraleftism
socialism,not_removed,and what did you think venezuela was before the bolivarian revolution lmao
socialism,not_removed,like how you added third world just to let everyone know youre a first world chauvinist your shameful and opportunist stances in regards to the bourgeois political movements of the third world is more concerning than my nonexisting chauvinism
socialism,not_removed,okay throw away one of the most progressive and antiimperialist governments in the world where socialist communes are actually springing up because you want to stay ideologically pure or whatever good for you but thats not going to help build socialism in venezuela or help them from imperialist destabilization
socialism,not_removed,i lived there then and can assure you it was nicer way nicer
socialism,not_removed,obviously not great but that does not justify support for the current government state socialism is a contradiction anyway
socialism,not_removed,okay throw away one of the most progressive and antiimperialist governments in the world where socialist communes are actually springing up because you want to stay ideologically pure or whatever revisionism is bad yet you condemn people for being ideologically pure hmm
socialism,not_removed,state socialism is a contradiction anyway yikes
socialism,not_removed,of course revisionism is bad just as the fact that venezuela is still a capitalist social democracy is bad but that doesnt mean im going to support us imperialism to overthrow its government im not going to act like the bolivarian revolution hasnt helped countless people and stood up to us imperialism in an age without actually existing socialism and you act as if there is no possibility of socialism being built in venezuela especially with the communes your comment makes absolutely no sense especially because the phenomenon of revisionism has nothing to do with ideological purity of people lmao and its not like we live in an era where there are revisionist states and anti revisionist states to compare there are no anti revisionist states anymore
socialism,not_removed,i dont think anyone would support the us invading another nation to overthrow its government but that doesnt mean we should outright support bourgeois political movements which is what you are doing its opportunism and you act as if there is no possibility of socialism being built in venezuela especially with the communes ive never commented on that
socialism,not_removed,how can one work up so much hate as to make him go and kill innocent people he doesnt know

socialism,not_removed,this is the best tldr i could make httpselectronicintifadanetblogsaliabunimahquebecmosqueattacksuspectlikedtrumpisraeliarmyfrenchfarright reduced by im a bot social media postings by the suspect in the shooting attack that killed six persons and injured at a quebec city mosque on sunday evening indicate he was a fan of us president donald trump french farright leader marine le pen and the israeli army alexandre bissonnette was arrested as a suspect in the slayings several miles from the mosque after he called police himself the newspaper le soleil reported quebec media reported that bissonnette is the suspected shooter version tldrs so far pms and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome top keywords
socialism,not_removed,the suburbs of quebec city especially the south shore are very conservative unfortunately the shooter was from caprouge a wealthy suburb known to be very rightwing the south shore is simply braindead land
socialism,not_removed,as a quebecer maybe i can offer a little insight quebec is generally more left leaning and progressive when it comes to most political issues however there is a very strong nationalist streak here and while the vast vast majority are just protect out culture and become our own country types it could be one of the reasons these facists are sprouting up
socialism,not_removed,do we get to bash yet
socialism,not_removed,yes all those innocent dukes generals and industrialists how tragic if only those russian peasants and workers had your infinite wisdom and spared all those innocent aristocrats sure they would have been tortured and killed in their millions under a brutal military dictatorship but then again you cant shoot those poor innocent military commanders murdering unarmed defenceless people in their place of worship is not nearly so bad as putting an end genocidal elites who were continuing to send millions of russians off to die in a completely pointless war literally causing mass starvation throughout the country keeping tens of millions of russian peasants in feudal bondage jeez why cant these socialists get these immutable facts through their thick skulls
socialism,not_removed,fuck off
socialism,not_removed,my family is from montreal and speaking with my relatives who still live in quebec is always interesting quebec politics as a whole is disjoint with the angloprovinces i feel that this comes from a unique french or quebec nationality that in turn parties have developed around i have read some unique novels of the french identity also serving as a class identity during the quiet revolution
socialism,not_removed,i am surprised i have never looked to read anything about the quiet revolution all i have seen is some hockey movie on it i should do myself the favour and find a book do you have any english suggestions
socialism,not_removed,its almost as if nationalism itself is the problem
socialism,not_removed,start with la meute literally the pack as in wolfpack theyre basically the altright of québec an extremist far right antiislamist group dedicated to and im quoting them protect our lands our values our foundations our liberties our safety as well as the future of our children against the islamic invaders like the altright theyre a largely online movement with members wouldnt be surprised to learn the shooter was one of them
socialism,not_removed,just the wikipedia page would be a good start it is impossible to understand quebec if you know nothing about the quiet revolution and how it came to be following a period called the great darkness

socialism,not_removed,the cpp most certainly does not support duterte
socialism,not_removed,jacobin is garbage when it comes to the philippine left
socialism,not_removed,the cpp and its armed wing the new peoples army npa and its legal front organizations including bayan and bayan muna have played a key role in supporting duterte in davao over several decades they have served in his administration run on his ticket and overseen his campaign

socialism,not_removed,we arent really using facebook alone its just one medium we are using
socialism,not_removed,fixed
socialism,not_removed,fixed
socialism,not_removed,i promise you that none of us plan on this being the case i was a volunteer for serve the people–austin and a supporter of red guards there so im taking my experience in helping the masses organize within their communities there and applying them to conditions here
socialism,not_removed,i have a wife and a baby so unfortunately my dream of being a traveling revolutionary wont ever come true
socialism,not_removed,because everyone else has elected to get into long drawn out arguments on the issue im going to keep it as brief as possible given the depth of the subject people empirically understand exploitation they experience it in their day to day life they hate their boss or hate their work they think politics sucks that is not the same as having a conscious understanding of the mechanisms of the capitalist system you cant fight what you dont understand even at a basic level you can strike for higher wages and better conditions sure you can struggle for a new government this is typically how mass discontent of the working class manifests itself but unless you understand explicitly and clearly that there is a need for a fight against capitalism thats all that it will be you have a revolutionary situation in france in and what happened was de gaulle being toppled and replaced with gaullists even in recent history you had the occupy wall street phenomenon a movement which had mass support and the amounted to nothing the arab spring which toppled dictators but also started a sectarian civil war and put in place new dictators whats lacking without the requisite conscious understanding of our oppression you will reproduce it in your struggle against it or fail to completely defeat it this logic of not needing to take part in an ideological struggle is one that historically failed it didnt happen in italy under bordigas leadership of the pci and we got mussolini for example furthermore this materialist determinist view that we just need to wait for the material conditions to be correct and the stars to align and well have socialism is frankly social democracy in action and i mean that in the classical sense social democrats thought we could just go simply and steadily from feudalism into capitalism develop capitalism and then we hit socialism somewhere down the line when conditions are correct the ignoring of ideology is a thoughtless theoretical error which doesnt even pretend to seriously analyse the problem after all if there was no need for ideological struggle then why read marx why call yourself a socialist why organise at all why talk about anything if you sincerely believed that ideological struggle that is the raising of consciousness was not a factor then you wouldnt be here trying to argue your position that ideology plays a role in class struggle is something which is frankly extremely intuitive and something you have to consciously unlearn your fundamental error is to view consciousness as exclusive with struggle and in opposition to it as opposed to dialectically related consciousness is raised through struggle and in turn these struggles lead to further struggle as workers draw conclusions about the capitalist system through our involvement in those struggles and the agitation of our ideas in those struggles we drive people to organise and build the revolutionary party and push struggles forward its a real strawman to think that everyone just wants to just convince everyone that the ideas of socialism are correct and suddenly well have socialism theres another error that people on certain trends on the socialist left have and its something drawn from that theoretical error and its simply to ignore our historical defeats when we lose and weve lost many times before consciouness of the working class is pushed back big time as much a sham as it was the collapse of the soviet union is one such defeat and it had a corresponding knock on effect on the international working class and so every time we have this fall in consciousness that is people giving up on class struggle and socialism or falling into political apathy were going to have to revisit old struggles and go through the same process again thats why reformists like corbyn and sanders are such a big deal to the working class despite the world having seen much of their like before your attitude that socialism will never have majority support is really a defeatist and conservative one and it was historically used as cover for parties to not involve themselves in struggles of working class people which they didnt deem revolutionary enough socialism must necessarily have majority support through deed at least if not through ideological affirmation without that support it cant win
socialism,not_removed,lets forget for a moment that the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas marx actually lets sincerely do that a lot of work has been done in the past years on how discourses are reproduced and enforced and how power plays into that and without getting lost in endless debates about gramscian and althusserian models of power distribution the long and short of it is that its a little more complex than marx thought as is often the case marx is important for the tradition of thought he started but is not the definitive authority on the matter imho how does raising consciousness translate to revolutionary activity class consciousness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for revolutionary activity and here im taking revolutionary activity to mean anything that challenges the staus quo not just grabbing your moisin and walking out onto the street if people cant appreciate the deleterious effects of capitalism and the viable alternatives to it that exist then theyre never going to challenge the status quo what has changed apart from their view on the world doesnt their view on the world matter quite a lot though unless we want to deny agency to the majority of people surely changing how they see the world is actually of fundamental importance what makes you so certain that people are going to listen to you above somebody else cos im pretty great s but in all seriousness theres no reason to assume that we wont be drowned out by the ideological apparatus of the state doesnt mean its not worth trying if consciousness raising is your primary tactic for achieving socialism then i think you need to ask yourself is it working i dont think the raising of consciousness is something that can be quantified as working or not working in no small part because it is constantly working against the ideological apparatus of the state and theres no way of being able to say what things would be like without the consciousness raising activity
socialism,not_removed,raising consciousness is only making people aware of the class exploitation inherent to capitalism revolution is started when the material conditions make people sick of the status quo if they arent class conscious then they will probably go towards fascism instead of socialism
socialism,not_removed,but what does this mean and how does it work exactly it involves a lot of extremely important work in decolonizing the us worker who through a combination of stateregimented education and widespread media hegemony knows absolutely fucking zero about their history their language or how capitalism works it involves forming revolutionary book clubs newspapers community educational workshops social media campaigns etc theres a lot of bullshit talk in this thread that every single worker knows that theyre being screwed over by capitalism fair enough its completely nonsense to assume that the vast majority of workers who have not been exposed to at the very least anticapitalist literature understand the explicit mechanisms of capitalist exploitation and if you do not understand them you cannot fight back against them and if anyone in this thread or this sub understood things like primitive accumulation surplus value the destruction of the commons or alternative historical attempts to destroy capitalism like revolutionary catalonia all before studying anything about socialism then please come forward because youre apparently the matt fucking damon of socialism and we need you lets forget for a moment that the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas marx and imagine that you can somehow convince the majority of the population to believe in socialism yes can we please stop pulling out marx quotes and using them absolute immutable laws of nature because that would just be awesome how does raising consciousness translate to revolutionary activity why causes this newly formed conscious section of the working class to rise up and abolish capitalism that didnt before what has changed apart from their view on the world to quote one of the best organizers in practice that i know of people do not rebel against systems they ideologically justify three years ago i was working as a food server in what was the most exploited working conditions ive experience thus far i had no issues with capitalism no issues with private property no issues with starting a company and my idol was steve fucking jobs whos company exploiting suicide factory workers in china eight years ago the entire global economy collapsed and i didnt see any the material conditions of that rupture in the system produce a revolution so yeah having your ideology shifted plays a pretty huge goddamn factor in whether or not youre willing to engage in revolutionary action the sad fact is that the socialist movement has had years to spread their message and were no closer to communism than we were a hundred years ago and how long did feudalism last never mind that in those years there have been many attempts at socialist revolutions of several different tendencies all of which had varying levels of success some of which are still alive the zapatistas and some of which literally just started rojava despite the advancement in communication technology which has made spreading socialist messages easier there are less socialists than there was years ago communist parties and affiliated trade unions use to have thousands sometimes millions of members yet they werent able to bring about revolution despite their huge numbers nowadays communist parties are lucky to break into triple digits you realize that were coming off of a fortyyear long counterrevolutionary period correct which leads me on to my next point what makes you so certain that people are going to listen to you above somebody else why would somebody buy into your vision of the future over somebody elses because theyre being exploited as fuck i can offer them an analysis of how that exploitation is happening and they can look at the organizing that we have hopefully been doing and see that other alternatives are possible where has consciousness raising gone wrong why hasnt it been able to convince the majority of the population to buy into socialism and overthrow the ruling class because there is an actively working brutally violent state that will work around the clock to decredit delegitamize and dismantle any organizations that become successful enough to spread a viable message to the people i swear to freaking god i dont get how left communists can understand perfectly that the change in material conditions work to produce changes within the people but do not understand that then the people have to work to produce changes in their material conditions this idea that the revolution is going to pop out of the fucking sky is nonsense if the material conditions of your world are producing radical changes in your philosophy you then need to organize for radical action to change your material conditions
socialism,not_removed,i honestly think its more for the prorevolutionaries than the people the prorevolutionaries say theyre trying to educate i dont think this is a bad thing actually its just that at times its a bit disingenuous and if youre expecting to go out and start a revolution by convincing a majority of people by talking and selling newspapers youre going to be very disappointed and this often creates demoralized leftists faster than new leftists it would be more useful in educating and edifying other socialists and welcoming anyone into the fold who happens to want to come both of the theory and realities of confronting capital such that theyre much better equipped to be effective in a revolutionary situation the only times ive seen numbers swell in these groups is when there is already a politicaleconomic crisis and many people are looking for answers not because the socialists acted heroically by being very charismatic andor sold a bunch of newspapers it also isnt surprising for the numbers to later completely deflate and go back to the small core of committed activists
socialism,not_removed,im getting a sense of dejavu here
socialism,not_removed,if consciousness raising is your primary tactic for achieving socialism then i think you need to ask yourself is it working the ruling ideas of every era are those of the ruling class yes but that doesnt mean that there cant be many other ideas around that make a change much more probable i think your are throwing out the baby with the bathwater one shouldnt attack the concept of consciousness raising without having taken a good long look at how socialistscommunistsanarchists have gone about doing that in the past it may just be that not the broad strategy was wrong but the tactics after all most of radical leftist history was and is dominated by authoritarian substitutionalists from the secondthird internationals to the new left and the ramnants of today lets take your question and turn it on its head if class consciousness is not raised under capitalism in at least parts of the wage working population how is there even the smallest chance that there will be a successful social revolution and a transition to communism in my opinion some form of fascism or even a transition to hypertech neofeudalism are more likely than a totally spontanous well organized mass movement of large parts of the population that brings about communism through the selfactivity of the people the history of humanity is one of learned helplessness passivity and looking for a leader that will not change just because capitalism crashed to have at least a kernel of organized and class conscious people to help out with the development of selfactivity without taking over thats a question of constant reflection is central to have any chance of succeeding
socialism,not_removed,i assume that youre talking specifically about socialist and communist movements in the west i would agree that the typical raising consciousness strategies of western socialist organizations especially trotskyist groups seem pretty lackluster and ineffective i think a lot of this has to do with the fact that they dont unite theory with practiceyou can yell and shout about how bad capitalism is all day and how we need socialism but unless you put forward an actual strategic vision for revolutionary struggle and mobilization people arent gonna be interested theyre going to stick with existing avenues of action and resistance such as shop floor militancy or mutual aid networks typically rooted in family networks or perhaps illegalism theory is nice for students but it is of little interest to the average worker unless its united with a practical strategy very few people want to join an organization that only exists to recruit more people to join the organization
socialism,not_removed,how the hell is this considered brief
socialism,not_removed,if people cant appreciate the deleterious effects of capitalism and the viable alternatives to it that exist then theyre never going to challenge the status quo people experience the deleterious effects of capitalism on a daily basis they dont need to be told that capitalism is exploiting them when the reality of the existence revolves around this fact i find this whole line condescending why then do we not go in to black communities and tell them that the police are racist i do not buy in to this idea that people need to have an idea in their head of what theyre going to build before they can destroy the old world if such a thing was the case then almost every revolution throughout history would of never happened because there was never a unified design for what life would be like after the revolution there was merely the pressing task of destroying the present state of things people know what they want but that doesnt necessarily mean they have an idea in their head of how to get it i think the thing that drives people to revolt more so than the idea of what theyd like the world to be like is the inability to tolerate the existing order of things that is not something that can be taught to the working class doesnt their view on the world matter quite a lot though unless we want to deny agency to the majority of people surely changing how they see the world is actually of fundamental importance lots of people have lots of ideas about how theyd like the world to be but that has yet to translate to revolutionary activity doesnt mean its not worth trying it kind of does doing something for the sake of doing something is a terrible idea you end up bringing people into these revolutionary organisations and putting them to work raising consciousness knowing full well that their efforts dont amount to anything after maybe years if youre lucky they get burned out and leave there is this terrible cycle of people joining revolutionary organisations and being completely demoralized by the lack of actual revolutionary activity these organisations are selling activists false hope in exchange for dues and paper sales
socialism,not_removed,do you think that workers arent aware that they are being exploited why do they need somebody else to explain to them what they experience every single day why dont we feel the same need to go into black communities and tell them that the police are racist fascism was a movement of the petit bourgeoisie it can hardly be said to have the support of the working class nor was it brought about through revolution no revolutionary movement in history was brought about through raising consciousness yet some of them arguably led to the establishment of dictatorships of the proletariat which are the first stage towards communism these people were not educated by a socialist elite so how did they manage to avoid fascism do you think that the working class has a natural tendency towards fascism
socialism,not_removed,great thread in my unbiased opinion
socialism,not_removed,if consciousness is not raised under capitalism in at least parts of the wage working population how is there even the smallest chance that there will be a successful social revolution and a transition to communism it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence but their social existence that determines their consciousness marx revolutionaries do not create revolutions revolutions create revolutionaries a simply materialist observation of history should provide ample evidence that the working class do not need to be cardcarrying socialists to create the conditions for revolution revolution is a product of material conditions brought about by the contradictions of capitalism which force the working class to struggle against it for their own survival in my opinion some form of fascism or even a transition to hypertech neofeudalism are more likely than a totally spontanous well organized mass movement of large parts of the population that brings about communism through the selfactivity of the people what makes you say that what is communism if not the selfactivity of the people communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established an ideal to which reality have to adjust itself we call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things the conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence marx to have at least a kernel of organized and class conscious people to help out with the development of selfactivity without taking over thats a question of constant reflection is central to have any chance of succeeding what is the role of this kernel of organized and class conscious people if not to lead either by way of actions or ideas
socialism,not_removed,relative to how much can be written on the subject its quite brief
socialism,not_removed,they dont need to be told that capitalism is exploiting them when the reality of the existence revolves around this fact i find this whole line condescending its not condescending if anything your assumption that we canshould act without engaging without the agency of the majority of the people is condescending as it reduces the working class to an instrument not a subject moreover a lot of people arent aware on a conscious level of the deleterious effects of capitalism because of the ideological apparatus of the state in action fyi here im just riffing off althusser thats why you find large portions of those exploited by capitalism supporting it wholeheartedly see essex tories in the uk or the american rust belt i do not buy in to this idea that people need to have an idea in their head of what theyre going to build before they can destroy the old world well thats not what raising class consciousness is about after all communism is not a utopioan goal but an ongoing struggle of relations its about revealing the reality of the capitalist mode of production and showing how that state of affairs is not necessary this necessitates discussion of alternatives but does not require coherent alternatives to be in place before action is taken i think the thing that drives people to revolt more so than the idea of what theyd like the world to be like is the inability to tolerate the existing order of things that is not something that can be taught to the working class right and as late europe showed us attempts to change the existing order of things radically does not by any mean necessitate socialist change lots of people have lots of ideas about how theyd like the world to be but that has yet to translate to revolutionary activity well i think youd find that a great many people dont have much of an idea of how theyd like the world to be to take a phrase from kierkegaard they exist primarily in the aesthetic mode of life the whole point of ideological state apparatus is that it has made the majority of people unable to really conceive of a noncapitalist mode of interaction and thats what we try to challenge doing something for the sake of doing something is a terrible idea thats not what im proposing im proposing we do something good despite a lack of assurance that it will be successful because the act itself is its own justification not dependency on the outcome you end up bringing people into these revolutionary organisations and putting them to work raising consciousness knowing full well that their efforts dont amount to anything thats not really the raising of consciousness im concerned with im talking about raising consciousness on an individual level or on the level of theory as those are the two im concerned with there may well be organisations out there like you described but im unqualified to speak on them
socialism,not_removed,do you think that workers arent aware that they are being exploited ive always known i was exploited as a worker but it wasnt until i learned from other socialists that i realized there was an alternative no revolutionary movement in history was brought about through raising consciousness yet some of them arguably led to the establishment of dictatorships of the proletariat which are the first stage towards communism do you think nobody spent time teaching the workers and peasants of russia and china about socialism before the revolutions im not super up on my soviet history but i know an awful lot about revolutionary china and i know it was something the communist party spent a lot of time on thats where the members of the red army came from
socialism,not_removed,ask trump supporters if they feel exploited by capitalism or hrc supporters
socialism,not_removed,revolutionaries do not create revolutions revolutions create revolutionaries a simply materialist observation of history should provide ample evidence that the working class do not need to be cardcarrying socialists to create the conditions for revolution revolution is a product of material conditions brought about by the contradictions of capitalism which force the working class to struggle against it for their own survival did i say anything against that my point wasnt that voluntarism is correct but that revolutionary conditions dont automatically produce communist revolutions what is communism if not the selfactivity of the people what does that even mean selfactivity is people taking care of their own interests taking over production of goods for use building an organization to coordinate what is necessary that doesnt mean that the goal of communism will actually be reached the whole communism is the real movement quote doesnt mean that the real movement is somehow the mode of production called communism it means that nothing else but the real movement depending on and partly determined by the seeds of communism already there in capitalism can bring communism about and create its concrete historical form out of their own practice and selfactualization what is the role of this kernel of organized and class conscious people if not to lead either by way of actions or ideas you are making up a false dichotomy here why would having class consciousness in some people mean that others who are just developing it are dominated even if people are already organized when the revolutionary moment begins that doesnt mean that they will be the leaders especially if they are aware of the danger of that
socialism,not_removed,well thats not what raising class consciousness is about after all communism is not a utopioan goal but an ongoing struggle of relations its about revealing the reality of the capitalist mode of production and showing how that state of affairs is not necessary this necessitates discussion of alternatives but does not require coherent alternatives to be in place before action is taken capitalism is not an idea it is not a set of principles that can be debated it is a set of economic functions held together by force no amount of revealing the reality of the capitalist mode of production is going to stop capitalism the only thing that can stop capitalism is force and that force can only come from the working class as the only class with the ability to stop production the source of power in capitalism people do not need to have an idea of what they want the world to look like in order to participate in the process of abolishing capitalism if that were the case then no revolution would of ever occurred revolutions are caused by material conditions not by lofty ideals im proposing we do something good despite a lack of assurance that it will be successful because the act itself is its own justification not dependency on the outcome call me a consequentialist but what is the point of an action if it does not lead to the results we want i believe you should judge an action by its consequences not by how good it makes you feel contrary to popular belief warm fuzzy feelings wont abolish capitalism
socialism,not_removed,how many workers do you talk to i am a worker i talk to workers everyday of my life because i work alongside them the majority of people i talk to know that the current order of things isnt right they may not express their discontent in the form of surplus value class struggle though that is a common theme amongst people i talk to or revolution but they know who the enemy is the bosses and politicians the idea that we need some college student to come and tell us were exploited is laughable people who think like that would be laughed out of almost every workplace they tried to enter let me ask you a question how many workers do you talk to because you obviously seem to see yourself as outside of the working class
socialism,not_removed,ive always known i was exploited as a worker but it wasnt until i learned from other socialists that i realized there was an alternative what difference has knowing theres an alternative made to your life have you suddenly decided to seize the means of production and overthrow the ruling class or are you in exactly the same position as before just with a bit more knowledge do you think nobody spent time teaching the workers and peasants of russia and china about socialism before the revolutions no they didnt the bolsheviks were a minority during the russian revolution they did not have the numbers nor influence to educate the masses about socialism
socialism,not_removed,what is communism to you because you appear to have this image of an ideal society in your mind that we are building towards instead of communism emerging out of the existing movement to abolish capitalism communism to you is something that we must adjust reality towards a predetermined plan that has already been decided upon i dont understand what you think communism is if you dont think people taking care of their own interests taking over production of goods for use building an organization to coordinate what is necessary has anything to do with communism you are making up a false dichotomy here why would having class consciousness in some people mean that others who are just developing it are dominated even if people are already organized when the revolutionary moment begins that doesnt mean that they will be the leaders especially if they are aware of the danger of that i am responding to your claim that this kernel of organised and class conscious people should not take over what is the purpose of this organised and class conscious kernel if not to lead the working class what purpose do they serve even if their role is to educate and spread ideas amongst the class they are still leading the class just in ideas instead of actions im confused about what role you think this revolutionary minority will play
socialism,not_removed,capitalism is not an idea i never claimed it was because that would be silly it is not a set of principles that can be debated no but the principles and assumptions that it is built on can can be it is a set of economic functions held together by force im going to be a little more explicit read althusser or one of his students like foucault or butler or even zizek the idea that capitalism is held together by force and here im pretty sure youre taking what might be termed a juridicodiscursve model of power as your understanding of force is an analysis that neglects the working of ideology in maintaining capitalist relationships failure to appreciate the role this ideology has in creating the human subject and inculcating in them an adherence to capitalist norms is a theoretical failure that leads to an incomplete analysis of capitalism and ultimately to positive action that will as adorno warned merely reinforce the dialectic it seeks to abolish the only thing that can stop capitalism is force and that force can only come from the working class as the only class with the ability to stop production naturally capital wont stop capitalism so it is up to labour to do so however labour wont do so if it remains in ideological thrall to capital revolutions are caused by material conditions not by lofty ideals im not talking about lofty ideals but a very grounded reality however the claim that if material conditions are sufficient a socialist revolution will just happen is nonsense that sort of crude material determinism is one that i think marx strongly rejected if labour does not have a sense of the alternatives to their exploitation they will never protest it call me a consequentialist but what is the point of an action if it does not lead to the results we want well obviously i could respond by pointing out the alternative metaethical theories to consequentialism alternatives that i think are better but instead im going to argue from a consequentialist perspective namely just because a certain act doesnt achieve the desired effect doesnt mean it has no effect and if the effect of raising consciousness has just been that people are more aware of their situation and have a more nuanced understanding of the world then i am content with that contrary to popular belief warm fuzzy feelings wont abolish capitalism thank you for trying to position yourself as the realz in the feelz vs realz debate but what im trying to say is that feelz are in fact realz and they are realz that shape how we interact with each other
socialism,not_removed,im confused as to what your arguments are here it seems like youre saying that at the end of the day organizing and socialist strategy are irrelevant because its material conditions that ultimately determine how the working class revolts and rebels i do agree with your earlier statement that a lot of socialist organizations are more or less useless because all they do is sit around and talk
socialism,not_removed,you dont need to convince a majority of the masses to rise you just need to convince enough to get the ball rolling when the cpc was founded in it had under members all of whom were intellectuals organizing made that number high enough that by it was able to defend against the gmd then the people started joining in greater numbers during the revolution with the aid of constant mass organizing like i said i dont know enough about the russian revolution to debate it but i provided one historical example where i know for a fact that organizing among the masses worked which to me is better odds than just waiting and hoping
socialism,not_removed,what is communism to you because you appear to have this image of an ideal society in your mind that we are building towards instead of communism emerging out of the existing movement to abolish capitalism communism to you is something that we must adjust reality towards a predetermined plan that has already been decided upon the communist mode of production is pretty much defined by the negation of capitalism dude and that means i can say that communism is a stateless classless society without moneythe value form and production for human need if that is a predetermined plan to you than i cant help you regarding the selfactivity yes thats part of a communist society but communism must also be worldwide meaning that peoples selfactivity in some area is not the same as a communist mode of production imagine there was a modern robert owen and he put up a few billion to establish a self sufficient commune with enough land ore tech etc etc to be independent from the rest of the planet would that be communism what purpose do they serve even if their role is to educate and spread ideas amongst the class they are still leading the class just in ideas instead of actions the ideas will be confronted with the revolutionary reality and everyone will be able to improve them disregard them transform them etc etc but i think this will not happen to the kernel of the communist ideas of the organized minority because there is actually objective truth to be had in this universe you cant be a communist and believe in a fair wage you cant be a revolutionary and think that a workers state is the way forward etc etc why would it be bad if these ideas these historical experiences of over years of struggle were to be present in form of an organizationorganizations of communists what you seem to advocate is hyperspontaneity and im very sceptical of that why do another round of trialanderror when there is a tradition of communism that can be learned from
socialism,not_removed,not op but are there any short althusser pieces i should read
socialism,not_removed,and then he realized he was arguing with a much smarter person and was never heard from again the end the story of uinsurgentclass
socialism,not_removed,congratulations so is the vast majority of humanity then why did you feel the need to ask how many workers id spoken to you act like the working class is some cultural minority or ethnicity with an inherent culture the working class is an economic function nothing more nothing less it is the strata of people who sell their labour power and produce value and what makes you think college students are not workers they do not produce value for one thing im definitely a penniless prole sorry to disappoint you i talk to plenty of workers im surrounded by them its a stupid question isnt it so why bother asking it in the first place many of them are ready to talk about how their job sucks their company pulled some bs on them or whatever but as soon as i start questioning why that happens from a socialist perspective most of them take that as their que to reign down the reactionary sometimes fascist and racist in nature but usually procapitalist achievement rhetoric and stuff about human nature and how capitalism is the best possible system and start redbaiting and shaming of course there are some that are more lefty but this is a very small minority and its mostly my already socialist friends people have a skewed perception of what socialism is thanks to decades of antisocialist propaganda from the ruling class what is important is that it is not necessary for people to understand what socialism is or to support it in order to fight capitalism do you think the russian workers understood what socialism was when they formed the first soviets no they simply knew that their present conditions were deplorable and that they wanted something better i think youre stuck in this idealist notion that the working class must first accept socialism as their ideal society before they can build that society you are putting the cart before the horse socialism is the product of the working class revolting against capitalism not some lofty ideal we conjure up in our heads before the revolution has even begun marx and engels spent long enough critiquing utopian socialists in their time you would of thought that tendency was dead by now i mean you started this thread about the ineffectiveness of consciousness raisingwhy do you think that is because consciousness is not a prerequisite for revolution revolutions are caused by material conditions they are spontaneous and unpredictable you cannot plan a revolution revolutionaries do not create revolutions revolutions create revolutionaries as marx said it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence but their social existence that determines their consciousness
socialism,not_removed,how short is short althusser is an incredibly nuanced and wideranging thinker and as such any analysis of his thought thats short and snappy tends to distort him add on to that my confession that i am by no means an expert on althusser or even close and take the recommendations as far from gospel it sounds really bad but the wikipedia page on althusser is actually really good and does a really good job of explaining the epistemological break in an intelligible way if youre looking for something more substanital the sep article on althusser is fantastic and does a really good job of ordering his thought so you can get a sense of why he thinks what he does if you want applied althusser then richard wolff does a of showing how ideological state apparatuses isas can be applied to the contemporary usa theres also a fun application of isas to japanese lunchboxes i know that im sure youd find if you google the phrase my personal advice is that there are main strands of althusser how to read marx the epistemological break ideological state apparatus the creation of the subject and that although they all join up in a coherent stream of thought its ok to tackle them one by one i still dont really get isas
socialism,not_removed,seems to be the defining essay by althusser its not particularly short but its worth plodding through if you want to get the gist of althusserian thought
socialism,not_removed,this is an immature and unnecessary comment
socialism,not_removed,well marx forbid we josh around from time to time comrade
socialism,not_removed,what makes you think they dont produce value most students i know work parttime or fulltime to help finance their education andor theyre taking out massive amounts to debt which just means a promise of future value production accumulating interest and in any case theyre expected to join the work force after they graduate if they are working parttime to fund their education then they are producing value in their role as workers not as students students do not produce value just because some students also happen to be workers does not negate that point are factory workers when their shift is done suddenly stop becoming members of an economic class because theyre no longer at the work place producing value they are no longer performing the economic function which determines their role in capitalism and which allows them to stop production thus making them the only class capable of carrying out revolution they are still workers yes but they are impotent workers at best until they enter the shop floor where they then become capable again of stopping production actually the more traditional workers ive talked to truckers dockworkers and utility workers during a lockout are more just interested in preserving what they already have a conservative and reactionary tendency that is because it is in the interests of the working class to defend themselves against capitalist encroachment it is not reactionary to want to protect what you already have by that logic every union member is a conservative and a reactionary capitalism forces the working class into conflict with the ruling class in order to defend their livelihoods even those who are merely interested in preserving what they have will be forced to struggle against the bourgeoisie at some point in the future this process class struggle is what leads the working class to socialism not some college student leafleting their picket line telling them about how exploited they are as if they didnt already know i mean why risk it when you make a year have benefits and a union to represent you precisely then why do you think telling them about socialism is somehow going to make them revolt what do you think is a bigger motivator somebody telling you about an imaginary world where people own the means of production or the actual reality of the bosses trying to remove your sick pay paid break overtime dental plan etc they would actually stand to lose more materially if there was a global socialist society not to mention massive wealth redistribution to the global south you think youre going to sell socialism to the masses when you admit they would be worse of because of it i dont have to say that they were all socialist theoreticians just at least they to the degree they wanted revolutionary transformation implicitly or explicitly believed in at least the possibility of an alternate social organization and had some vague conception of what it might look like they had to have some politics that told them that doing x actually represents their interests more than any other thing again youre putting the cart before the horse why do people have to be able to imagine a new world before they can destroy the old one there is no politics behind i cant feed my wife and kids there is no politics behind i want more pay there is no politics behind i want to work less it just seems naive to wait around for the revolution as if its this abstract thing made up of anything other than a collective of people making decisions and taking up political struggle it seems just as naive to assume that you can somehow control plan or prepare for the revolution when history has shown us that revolutions are spontaneous events caused by material conditions conditions that are out of our control
socialism,not_removed,being a worker isnt a role or performance its a class position by way of a social relation peasants didnt suddenly stop being a peasant because they stopped peasanting farming after the days end perhaps choosing to read or go to the pub the kids of workers going through training education and preparation for the work force arent somehow outside of society and the class system until they graduate the working class is a function of capitalism if somebody is not performing that function the production of surplusvalue then how can they said to be a part of that group whos defining feature is that function it is reactionary when they throw revolutionaries and other workersthe poorthe global south that their country generally exploits and extracts wealth from under the bus to preserve their privileged place in the house though who is responsible for that though is the working class in first world countries responsible for the exploitation of workers in the third world or is it the bourgeois do you think people should forgo what little privileges they have for an ideal that doesnt exist yet youre starting to sound a lot like organised religion youre arguing for socialism on solely moral grounds which is a slippery slope comrade it is reactionary when trade unions suppress revolutionary elements in the workforce and side with the bosses this is the very logic of fascist reaction that is not working in the interests of the working class that is working in the interests of the ruling class that is the complete opposite of communism and the complete opposite of everything i have said up until this point revolution is about more than just economiccrude material selfinterest what revolution hasnt started due to some economic demand remember the russian revolution started with a series of strikes for better pay but for there to be a socialist revolution i think its safe to say that it follows that the people involved should be convinced that socialism can provide what theyre wanting to fight for what is a socialist revolution exactly from the way you speak of socialism it would appear you view socialism as an state of affairs which is to be established an ideal to which reality have to adjust itself which runs contrary to marxism socialism is not something to be worked towards socialism emerges out of the natural struggle of the working class against the ruling class what determines whether or not something is a socialist revolution should be whether or not it abolishes the present state of things not whether those participating are trying to build a new society called socialism a society that will be determined and constrained by its formulation under the capitalist mode of production i might add because if they dont think another world is possible then they will as many of them do now resign to capitalism being a necessary evil or yeah theres a lot of shit but capitalism is the best we have that is not always the case though and more often than not people revolt regardless of their belief in a better world not because they suddenly accepted marx as their lord and saviour but because their conditions under capitalism have become unbearable and so they seek to destroy it in whatever way they can i cant feed my wife and kids i want more pay and i want to work less are inherently political matters its for socioeconomic reasons that such things happen and its in the realm of political struggle that they can be adequately approached in any meaningful and longterm sense they are political for you but for the majority of working class folk they are matters of everyday existence history has shown us no such thing most revolutions have decades of organizing and agitating before something like a revolutionary revolt happens revolts can be spontaneous but for anything like revolutionary transformation of society to happen there has to be politics involved care to give me an example
socialism,not_removed,the working class is a function of capitalism if somebody is not performing that function the production of surplusvalue then how can they said to be a part of that group whos defining feature is that function what that doesnt make any sense which is the function the working class or the production of surplusvalue the function of capitalism is the private accumulation of surplusvalue of which the working class is a necessary component and value is realized in other ways than just productive labor of which most students are a part of whether you want to recognize it or not its also in the extraction of rents students have to finance their education and pay rents through debt which is postponement of value production at the cost of compound interest theyre still working class insofar as they stand in this kind of social relationship with capital mark zuckerbergs kid if she doesnt have to pay for her education but her father pays for it with surplus value from his business being trained to become a manager and assumes the capital of his father at some point would be an example of a student thats not a worker who is responsible for that though is the working class in first world countries responsible for the exploitation of workers in the third world or is it the bourgeois do you think people should forgo what little privileges they have for an ideal that doesnt exist yet youre starting to sound a lot like organised religion youre arguing for socialism on solely moral grounds which is a slippery slope comrade in some respects they bare responsibility when they actively support exploitation im not going to start empathizing with fascists and proimperialists because well its not their fault theyre just victims of their circumstances im not proposing that people should do x or y because of some moral argument although i might be willing to go there but thats not my point here im merely describing an instrumental imperative if they really want a more free and just society they will have to assume risks and costs as revolutionaries so that future generations can live in that free and just society im sorry but i dont have much sympathy or support for wealthy uppermiddle class workers who support forms of imperialism and anticommunism in order to retain their relative material privileges what revolution hasnt started due to some economic demand remember the russian revolution started with a series of strikes for better pay as well as a revolt against the repression of the tsarist state and monied interests and against participation in a ruling class war what is a socialist revolution exactly from the way you speak of socialism it would appear you view socialism as an state of affairs which is to be established an ideal to which reality have to adjust itself which runs contrary to marxism socialism is not something to be worked towards socialism emerges out of the natural struggle of the working class against the ruling class what determines whether or not something is a socialist revolution should be whether or not it abolishes the present state of things not whether those participating are trying to build a new society called socialism a society that will be determined and constrained by its formulation under the capitalist mode of production i might add this is a bunch of sloganeering that doesnt mean anything what on earth could the abolition of the present state of things look like that doesnt involve some building of a new society socialism isnt just a negative relation thats really naive and setting people up for disaster its also a positive assertion of an alternative i think building a socialist society is a lot harder than you think and will require a lot of creative ideas from smart people to build systems and new institutions that help facilitate the distribution of resources and labor inputs across productive industries and democratic decision making while respecting certain principles i really dont give a shit if millions of people spontaneously rebel if they have no intention of building anything the day after that is not always the case though and more often than not people revolt regardless of their belief in a better world not because they suddenly accepted marx as their lord and saviour but because their conditions under capitalism have become unbearable and so they seek to destroy it in whatever way they can they can revolt like this and they do all the time usually in the form of riots but to act in real steps toward revolutionary transformation of the base of society is something else entirely and requires politics nobodys suggesting they believe in socialism like a religion actually quite the opposite i think people should approach revolutionary theory more scientifically youd rather people forget politics all together which really would just result in pogroms and fascist reaction because people would just be acting with the ideologies they brought to the crisis they are political for you but for the majority of working class folk they are matters of everyday existence and my point is why consider matters of everyday existence like this somehow not political theyd have to see them in a political light of some form to begin to think that acting politically would address them in any way care to give me an example take your pick man socialist and anarchist organizations had been agitating and organizing against the tsarist regime for years before the revolution and a number of groups lead demonstrations and strikes for months leading up to february they meet regularly for meetings to coordinate further activity debate events etc for the revolution to be pushed in a socialist nature further organization is required and was required for october the initial arab spring revolutions were relatively spontaneous not to mention turkey and brazil but they didnt result in everyone magically coming to anticapitalist and socialist conclusions they were all liberal in nature islamic fundamentalist or resulted in failed states i have no faith in spontaneous revolutions and a bunch of people suddenly protesting is nothing special it happens all the time what matters is how its pushed politically toward revolutionary aims the transformation of the basic social relations of society
socialism,not_removed,do you have a translation into english of this its funny how many polish people are farright and antiimmigrant its like they dont realize the white nationalists of britain are going after polish immigrants doesnt apply to them if theyre tokens ig

socialism,not_removed,as a psy neuro student i can say without a doubt that this is completely bullshit its not even a research paper but a halfarsed blog why is it on this subreddit
socialism,not_removed,idk why this is being down voted climate change is in my opinion one of the best arguments against capitalism thanks to documentaries like theses are the reason why im a socialist today they get you to start thinking critically of the current system that allowed this global threat to occur leo even says hes not sure if anything will stop it reading between the lines knowing that as long as we have capitalism climate change wont be fixed
socialism,not_removed,why is this liberal hogwash being upvoted on a socialist subreddit minutes of leonardo dicaprio barack obama and elon musk isnt getting downvoted to hell i dont care if the cause is good the method is still framed around hierarchical structures and detriments the working class
socialism,not_removed,sees screencap of leo and obomba sighs reaches for downvote button
socialism,not_removed,film sends entirely the wrong message downvoted
socialism,not_removed,i still think the movie was great for specific reasons most importantly dicaprios main goal seemed to be to educate as many people as he can about climate change and its seriousness he isnt a scientist he doesnt have all that much credibility on the subject therefore he had to be as much of a neutral party as possible think about it if he had even mentioned jill steins name for example there would be a media furor against the movie labeling it left wing green party propaganda if the movie were in any way radical it would likely turn off a lot of the people dicaprios trying to educate
socialism,not_removed,dude relax we can give a socialist perspective to things that are in the mainstream actually viewing this is interesting because the message is there is no solution cant you see how ripe this is to what it leads to which is that the root is capitalism socialists need to be able to relate to what the mainstream are consuming so that we can give the right answers
socialism,not_removed,okay then let me give that a shot in my mind climate change and ecological destruction are some of capitalisms biggest crimes and its effects will overshadow the worst of what weve seen in anticommunist propaganda especially if left unchecked especially as socialists we should be concerned that climate change is going to fuck over mainly poor brown people culling the undesirables while leaving the rich and powerfull high and dry so if doing nothing amounts to allowing a passive genocide and if we dont buy into the liberal fairy tales what does the left have to bring to the table right now to actually help solve this problem without relying on dreams of a sudden proletarian uprising
socialism,not_removed,conveniently ignores that pretty much all serious climate change activism was the result of grassroots leftist movements
socialism,not_removed,im sorry if you perceived that as an attack im grateful for the awareness that has been spread as most people who would want to be informed about cg now seem to be however my question was more aimed at how we as the left currently approach the problem of confronting multinationals and states on this issue in a way that isnt just the same old liberal symbolism because honestly most of what i see feels like that when we actually consider the relevant timescales
socialism,not_removed,open source is totally a mine for capital though look at google with chrome and android or the way linux is utilised for corporate servers i love open source but i think that capital has adapted to exploit it as a resource which is deeply unfair to contributors whos labour is essentially stolen that said my understanding socioeconomic and political change historically is that has more often than not been directly connected to changes in infrastructure and developments in tech i think especially given how far we are from a global revolution installing socialist infrastructure socially and physically while also developing technologies that enable socialism is definitely productive and can be utilised to assist the working class with the pressures of liberal capitalism
socialism,not_removed,ive thought about creating a system where we use distributed computing like boinc programs or hpc to run economic calculations i read somewhere recently that the calculation problem had been solved but even if not neural networks are typically a viable alternative so with that solved the problem becomes a question of how to interface it with reality imo this could be done with a sort of optin syndicalism you list what skills you have on some kind of website or exchange you build your reputation through production and you get admitted to syndicates by meeting certain expectations within these organizations labor is performed in a moneyless system with the expectation that whatever your needs are will be matched by how much you opted in for those completely opted in theres no need to worry about finance at all as your productivity and needs would be managed collectively with the ability to opt out we ensure that these coops are basically voluntary associations and can grow and collapse on their own merits its not communism but i think some kind of decentralized planning like that is about as good as it gets without postscarcity economics
socialism,not_removed,you might be interested in ive only read parts of it and a lot of it is halfbaked but its food for thought
socialism,not_removed,can you coopt uber and airbnb
socialism,not_removed,i dont really have any ideas but im lurkin on this
socialism,not_removed,free software open source free software is software built by and for the community open source is software made by a company and other people are allowed to work on it too linux is a weird case because it was started as free software and it still is communitydriven to a huge extent but its so useful for companies that they started paying people to work on it
socialism,not_removed,that sounds like a pretty good solution especially with the strong technology factor theres so much automation that we can do to each industry that we could finally focus on new ideas research art etc
socialism,not_removed,hmm ill have to take a deeper look at that but at face value it seems intriguing
socialism,not_removed,do you know if dmytri kleiner telekommunisten are still working on building things or if its seized
socialism,not_removed,that already exists its called craigslist
socialism,not_removed,as in provide forprofit services like uber and airbnb but where all employeescontractors partake in the profits
socialism,not_removed,its increasingly common though chrome was an open source project as was android as were probably lots of things plus people can always dip into open source resources for a profit motive my computer system if you can call a salvaged broken laptop and a borrowed monitor a system only runs open source free software except for chrome cos i like google apps anything the working class produces will be seen as a resource for exploitation for profit thats what makes capitalism so hard to hack
socialism,not_removed,no clue they still have a website httptelekommunistennet and the last activity was days ago
socialism,not_removed,can op coopt craigslist
socialism,not_removed,employeescontractorscustomers partake in the profits no profits income gets disbursed but i mean take them over hack them so the income gets disbursed that way
socialism,not_removed,free software isnt much to do with profit but it does prevent excessive appropriation of workers efforts in nonpublic software development a worker can spend years crafting software but it belongs to the company and the worker cannot use and modify it for their own purposes after they leave the company if the company was starting atop of existing gpld software they would be obligated to provide the source code to whoever received the final product and workers would be free to take their code and do new things with it after they leave the company it negates one bit of property
socialism,not_removed,use chromium its chrome but actually opensource
socialism,not_removed,their projects all seem to be nonoperational though and most of the links seem to be dead but the guys active on twitter hmm
socialism,not_removed,woah woah woah reddit is not the place to talk about that
socialism,not_removed,yeah theyre fairly explicit about work done under company employment where i work and theyre also obligated to dish the source code on existing gpld software
socialism,not_removed,wat op brought it up you provided a link
socialism,not_removed,hacking is different from cracking hacking is making cool things really shoddily for fun cracking is breaking into computer systems and reddit is not the place to talk about it
socialism,not_removed,congo free state million killed by belgian colonialism genocide of native americans million native people killed by european colonists in both north and south america herero and namaqua genocide at least killed by german imperialists korean war killed by rok and usa in korea vietnam war killed by usa in vietnam laos and cambodia iraq war at least killed by usa in iraq british empire in india killed iraq sanctions killed us sponsored democide of communists in indonesia million killed us sponsored genocide in bangladesh killed us manufactured famine in bangladesh up to million killed as a result of famine in bangladesh after the us withheld food aid because of bangladeshs relationship with cuba us backed invasion of east timor up to us backed genocide in west papua killed rwandan genocide french imperialists directly supported the dictatorship in rwanda before and during the genocide which killed people congo war up to million killed after usbacked regimes in uganda and rwanda invade congo for its resources and diamonds great potato famine million killed in british occupied ireland us backed genocide in guetamala killed world war around killed obviously this is just scratching the surface of capitalist and imperialist crimes but its a start while many of these were not necessarily perpetrated by capitalists one must remember that imperialism is capitalism in its highest stage and almost all of these are due to imperialism edit major things ive forgotten are the us invasion of the philippines killing the continued turkish genocide of kurds killing up to people the russian states genocide against the chechen people killing up to and the indian states actions in kashmir killing
socialism,not_removed,and what about the mass death and suffering under capitalism capitalism has been and is directly responsible for millions of death as well as being the cause of world poverty people die everyday from starvation and billion people live in poverty this is a direct result of capitalism that is not even taking into account the numerous wars that have been fought to protect economic interests i think its pretty safe to assume that you dont really understand socialism and me saying this will probably be completely futile even if the numbers you gave for deaths under socialism are correct which they most certainly are not capitalism is easily responsible for more deaths
socialism,not_removed,those deaths have less to do with people wanting democratic control over the means of production and more to do with people trying to use brute force authoritarianism to achieve their goals which is applicable to other ideologies as well
socialism,not_removed,how can you like a system with so much wealth and still so many people living in poverty and being exploited so many people dying because they have no water because it is privatized now so many people working for starvation wages so big profits for companies an environment which is getting exploited you wont find many people here who will defend those communist regimes which were never communist
socialism,not_removed,mediocre pasta
socialism,not_removed,well the nhs for one
socialism,not_removed,capitalisms death toll
socialism,not_removed,most likely comes from the association between a planned economy and a command economy which is the general caricature of centralized planning that you learn about in school also i find this dichotomy between planned and unplanned economies to be nothing more than an exercise in bourgeois ideology to one degree or another every economy in human history has and will incorporate elements of planning the question is twofold is the planning public or private and is it mass democratic or nondemocraticbureaucratic
socialism,not_removed,literally modern day mccarthyism utterly despicable
socialism,not_removed,employers look for people with degrees even though the job may not require it it shows the applicant is trainable and probably serious about finding work the shit part of it is that job prospects are so low for everyone that companies can continue to hire over qualified people for lower pay it will only get worse as degrees are more and more common
socialism,not_removed,this is some scary shit half a year ago i didnt think he would be able to pull it off but now
socialism,not_removed,like ive been saying these are the early stages of a selfcoup a nations leader despite having come to power through legal means dissolves or renders powerless the national legislature and unlawfully assumes extraordinary powers not granted under normal circumstances
socialism,not_removed,i am reminded of trumps continued operation of a private personal security force and his deep rift with the intelligence community last sunday kellyanne conway said that its really time for to put in his own security and intelligence community and this seems likely to be the case ss panzer division leibstandarte ss adolf hitler donald trump
socialism,not_removed,i stopped once i got to resistance fatigue this is dimensional chess that is totally unnecessary to put forward the fairly unradical perspective that this is a coup of sorts yes this is a completely different sector of the ruling class that has taken hold of power no this is not the first time fundamental regime change has occurred in the us i dont see any evidence of resistance fatigue if anything i see radicalization of my liberal facebook friends who are now down with punching nazis and occupation of airports
socialism,not_removed,deleted
socialism,not_removed,dont really think i buy that oil company claim from a mostly discredited report the risk there seems astronomical but the rest seems fairly accurate
socialism,not_removed,im not sure what to make of this article but do i have grave doubts for the future
socialism,not_removed,seems like a bunch of game theory to me trump has his party in control of all branches already why the need for a coup
socialism,not_removed,ive been endlessly thinking about how this exposes fundamental massive weaknesses in the structure of us government supreme court tells the president to hey stop that he says no then what nothing congress steadily grants tons of power to the president they want to roll it back he says no then what not a damn thing without majority theoretically we could get a new congress in two years who could push him out but again in the meantime who would stop efforts at massive voter suppression in the meantime not the supreme court the whole idea of checks and balances has as much actual force as a stop sign if a driver doesnt want to comply
socialism,not_removed,resistance fatigue will eventually set in you can see most historical movements for social change succeeded at what appeared to be the hour and if most narratives hold true they were pretty close to falling apart to act as if attrition isnt a broader strategy is naive at best
socialism,not_removed,that article doesnt make the situation more reassuring in fact the opposite for me it makes it clear how little we know is actually going on
socialism,not_removed,this is a really good counterpoint to ops article id recommend it we cant just analyze everything trump does through the lens of germany there are huge differences in context that will harm our ability to effectively resist a modern american coup will be one of continued devolution of power to corporatefinance institutions it wont be as flashy but it will be just as effective at silencing the people
socialism,not_removed,to me this article misses the point its like arguing that trump is not a fascist because he hasnt organized tens of thousands of unemployed veterans into a paramilitary force yet we cannot infer what someone wants or whether power is being exerted effectively based on outcomes alone the above line seems particularly obtuse to me it seems to me the best way to read intent is based on outcomes so whether trump is banning refugees because of intent or incompetence is beside the point the state is being used to neglect refugees as well as implementing a religious test for entry into the country whether or not trumps unorthodox moves are signs of weakness or strength is moot if there is no earnesteffective resistance and that is only possible if people recognize the stakes ie the potential for a coup in the very near future at any point during trumps presidency even a failed coup would have disastrous implications
socialism,not_removed,because there are elections in two years and he might lose some of that power in fact there are republicans who even now vocally oppose him meaning they might not vote what he wishes them to vote on fascists want their power to be absolute
socialism,not_removed,supreme court tells the president to hey stop that he says no then what nothing congress steadily grants tons of power to the president they want to roll it back he says no then what not a damn thing without majority andrew jackson tested this out long ago when the supreme court deemed indian removal read war crimes bordering on genocide to be illegal jackson proved that it was the loyalty of goons not the judgment of justice that created us laws the thing thats kept some presidents from testing out autocracy in the past i think is just plain politics autocracy is a hard sell trump believes hes a great salesman though and he has no moral code whatsoever
socialism,not_removed,one would hope that at some point if things got so bad that the military would step in assuming the common populace is not yet organized enough to do it themselves as they swear to defend the constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic not simply the government but im always extremely skeptical of militarybacked overthrows
socialism,not_removed,if your american chief be a man of ambition and abilities how easy is it for him to render himself absolute the army is in his hands and if he be a man of address it will be attached to him and it will be the subject of long meditation with him to seize the first auspicious moment to accomplish his design and sir will the american spirit solely relieve you when this happens patrick henry
socialism,not_removed,supreme court tells the president to hey stop that he says no then what then the people with their hands on the levers of power those who hold lower offices and actually enforce regulations balk the system shuts down in the places of conflict until the conflict is resolved you are already seeing this with the muslims ban the people pushing this ridiculous coup narrative are fucking bonkers whos going to put on the stormtrooper outfits and start shooting civilians ive got a neighbor whos a sheriff hes not going to start killing people or profiling muslims either hes already said as much you think the level of control of one of the least popular regimes in american history reaches down to the individual citizens who actually interact with the public guess again remember the speech from fight club i modified it by two words for this situation look the people you are afterworried about are the people you depend on we cook your meals we haul your trash we connect your calls we drive your ambulances we guard you while you sleep frankly i expected better from fellow socialists were supposed to believe in the people and their ability to make the right choices and do the right thing even in the face of tyranny you look around and you see people protesting in the street shutting down airports you see governors and mayors defying the white house you see people coming together on the air in civic spaces to fight against evil policies and you spew this bullshit about living under some new kind of fascism this orange cocksuckers got a countdown to impeachment you know it i know it dogs know it enjoy the ride and stop spewing this garbage about trumps mystical ability to undermine our system if the mainstream left hadnt pumped hillary at the expense of a real change candidate or even someone more mainstream but minimally trustworthy we wouldnt be here the dnc is more responsible for trumps election than the goddamn rnc
socialism,not_removed,super bowl maybe
socialism,not_removed,capitol fire
socialism,not_removed,im not disputing it as a factor that it could be planned for in the abstract is just a supposition applying such an abstraction to what is a dynamic and path dependent process where morale changes based on material conditions and success or failure of events reads to me as fatalism supposing that they are master manipulators with svengali powers is just that edit in fact you can just as easily theorize that bannon has no fucking clue what he is doing and is about to get canned
socialism,not_removed,deleted
socialism,not_removed,yep ive been remembering back to eighth grade history to what andrew jackson said in john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it extremely worrying precedent that the most notable instance of the president disregarding the courts was in order that he could commit genocide
socialism,not_removed,this wont be a popular thought but ive lived around the military all of my life its highly unlikely most soldiers are going to disobey orders even the top brass is politically apathetic at best those who arent tend to be conservative
socialism,not_removed,whos going to put on the stormtrooper outfits and start shooting civilians i think you are missing the point its not suggested its a military coup this is a coup by the president who is dismantling and consolidating power and that should be a worry for you i really do hope that hes heading for impeachment but its worrying signs that hes intending on holding absolute power with his inner circle
socialism,not_removed,comment saved
socialism,not_removed,people are downplaying the extent of trumps malevolence its the sort of thing that has gone on since he first announced his candidacy hes a buffoon who will never go anywhere at this point its pretty clear that trump is not totally incompetent and that he is not likely to be his own undoing if it looks like trump might be planning a coup assume he is planning a coup
socialism,not_removed,i really do hope that hes heading for impeachment but its worrying signs that hes intending on holding absolute power with his inner circle the usa has never been ruled without consent of the governed this guy got elected through the usual process and if he does not bend in the wind of popular opinion well elect someone else in four years youre telling me after a week youre concerned about him consolidating permanent power because all i see is a psyop to convince gullible people he needs to be taken out so were not overly rambunctious when it occurs
socialism,not_removed,i dont think trump has a tight enough political circle nor enough shadow power to do a false flag attack by himself but if his interests align well enough with putins then anything might happen
socialism,not_removed,steve bannons thoughts on the matter trump is a blunt instrument for us he told me earlier this summer i dont know whether he really gets it or not it is likely that bannons political calculus here if not trumps will be less about winning an election that seems a bit out of hand and more about cementing an american nationalist movement i agree that it is past time to stop underestimating these people but i think the people we should be looking at are steve bannon and eric prince eric prince specifically isnt mentioned as often as he could be jeremy scahill has written books about him and his private mercenary firms hes easily the most terrifying political figure i know of and will be playing a huge role in whatever trump is doing next probably both foreign and domestic followed by an unprecedented wave of imperialism and austerity i sincerely think that the trump administration is posed to make the rest of us history look like childs play
socialism,not_removed,if it looks like trump might be planning a coup assume he is planning a coup this the worst that could happen is you have to admit you overestimated trumps or bannons abilities intentions the best is you prevent a fascist coup why risk it
socialism,not_removed,deleted
socialism,not_removed,his appointments and lack of regard for due process is quite worrying im not making any wild calls right now much of that article is unsubstantiated but there is enough for us to be concerned and to keep a close eye on things
socialism,not_removed,im quite certain that russia or israel for example have the capability and willingness to go to such extremes
socialism,not_removed,thank you for referencing eric prince ive followed jeremy scahills reporting on him also and to know that he is behind the scenes makes me very nervous as if a trump presidency isnt nerve wracking enough im nervous for what the future holds but im going to keep organizing and doing my part
socialism,not_removed,how does it get priebus role wrong it states that it is unusual for the chief of staff to make the sort of announcement that priebus made vis the muslim ban
socialism,not_removed,good for you comrade i hope we pull through this one without a large holy war
socialism,not_removed,very interesting if you follow the official statements of the different institutions here the main party pyd tevdem the womens movement then you can see that everybody in rojava clearly understands the interests of america in syria we all know what he us wants and what it doesnt want and their responsibility for groups like isis and al nusra it is more than they destroyed iraq and so forth they took a role in directly creating them then they lost control of them and now they have to fix the problem they created so naturally they want our help our relationship to them is again open and official not a secret – it is tactical not strategic they want to use us and we try to get the best out of it we have to we have lot of enemies and we have to defend ourselves it is a practical and political necessity to find our place in the balance of so many big players around us because everyone has interests in syria so we try to defend the interests of the people and thats not possible when you just say no no no and start conflicts with all enemies at once their main regional allies are of course turkey barzanis peshmerga forces and still parts of the fsa who they are training with the british army in lebanon turkey is attacking kurds here in bakur and clearly aiding isis and the peshmerga are badly trained and motivated whilst the ypg has been the most effective force against isis on the ground so america has to be seen to be helping us as well in fact we forced them though building up a strong military position to cooperate with us that gives us the possibility to make the position of this revolution stronger and thats something that we need revolution is nothing that you can defend by talking about it you have to give something to the people you have to protect them you have to give food to them you have to give infrastructure to them and if you are isolating yourself completely from everyone else you cant do that america would like to have us as a main ally but they know that is not possible militarily we are cooperating at times but ideologically we are enemies america is the avantgarde force of the capitalist system and we are the avantgarde force of the alternative maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but one day in the future this will come to a head

socialism,not_removed,my response from last time a similarish question was posted whats the best method of distribution electronicallyplanned economy because markets suck balls markets only respond to effective demand and hence oftentimes dont yield the most socially necessary results like there being million people in america who are either sporadically or chronically homeless while million homes go unused dehumanize the people who are forced to take part in them through advertisement and the abstraction of laborpower away from the living person that provides it promoting unhealthy and even selfdestructive behaviors require competition which is the main cause of economic crises in extracting andor realizing surplus value and also lead to a huge waste of resources cant comprehend for their lives that decisions made between a buyer and a seller can impact a third unconsulted party which is why its so hard almost certainly impossible actually to coax the market economies of today to be environmentally sustainable are totally obsolete because we can do so much better in every respect by bringing all production into the direct democratic control of the people with modern computers doing the bruteforce calculations for us and the list goes on in my mind theres absolutely no reason why markets should stick around after socialism is established theyre just a shitty system of resource distribution if youre looking for a more thorough critique of markets marxs capital offers a pretty good one less indepth but much more approachable is the law of value video series which i found very helpful and convincing and as always cockshott and cottrells towards a new socialism is worth a read for its model of planning which though not fully fleshed out is a great basis for developing future planned economies around
socialism,not_removed,markets mean the people with the most money can afford more stuff that can be extrapolated to the general law that people who already have more get even more than they already have thats it on a basic level
socialism,not_removed,we would still be producing for demand and not for necessity you would still have no reasonable motivator for companies to research cheap medical solutions for unprofitable lifethreatening problems but instead a giant demand for hairloss products differently put noone would research an actual treatment for aids when the current medication is so much more profitable and that for years and not just as a onetime payment in other words its still more profitable to produce dogfood then it is to provide a cheap and healthy diet for poor people its not a fixable problem in society with different spending abilities as long as one group of people have a higher spending power then others you will never have a market that procudes what is actualy needed
socialism,not_removed,i have more problems with ubi schemes than with markets id prefer a full employment guarantee to welfare statism because i worry about empowering the state especially if the state is dominated by capital and capitalists the last thing we want is for people to feel like they are dependent on the continuation of economic and military imperialism for their day to day survival on the other hand like most socialists i would favor needsbased provision of stuff like healthcare education childcare basic food and housing etc however its important for us to be aware of the historic relationship between state imperialism and the welfare state when we advocate this stuff whether the state sanctions them or not markets tend to emerge if there is scarcitydemand for a good or service so the people talking about abolishing markets are generally thinking in terms of a hypothetical postscarcity society which imo is straying pretty far away from economics in the real world a realworld economy including all presentday capitalisms and socialisms is going to be a mix of planning and markets i recommend these articles although virtually every proposal at thenextsystemorg is interesting and worth a read as a good introduction to the characteristics of a socially just and ethically desirable socialism httpwwwthenextsystemorgeconomicdemocracy httpthenextsystemorgstartwithworkerselfdirectedenterprises
socialism,not_removed,if we ended private property and still had markets what
socialism,not_removed,markets in its current and only capitalist meaning are bad because they as marx would put it fragment social labour into private labours conducted independently from each other ie into independent firms that take independent economic planning decisions in competition with each other and are therefore under certain pressures and constraints to buy and exploit wagelabour thus even if every firm was a worker coop it would still be subject to the same capitalist pressures and tendencies if this social labor was fragmented into private labours all competing with one another markets are also a very inefficient way of establishing an equilibrium between needs and outputs a distribution of labour across various branches of the productive economy to meet needs only needs capable of being expressed through effective demand are registered in a capitalist economy and equilibrium is happened upon almost accidentally if at all through price fluctuations and a gap of information between the economic fundamentals and their register in effective demand leading to among other things wasted labour and overproduction in a socialist economy however distribution of labour inputs happen on a conscious and planned basis lets say you have an economy interlinked with a cybernetic system designed to register almost immediately uncorrupted information about economic fundamentals and social needs across various sectors to be relevant in the planned democratic decision making of selecting priorities for labour distribution by workers as you can see market in the sense that im using it is semantically loaded with meanings that assume the essential content of the economic institution built around private capital ie the private firm the exploiterexploited relationship isnt unique to capitalism thats just a feature of hierarchical economic systems in general as far as i know all attempts at socialist markets so far have just been ways of reintroducing private capital into the economy while being couched in socialist rhetoric whether with true socialist intentions or not see the doi moi reforms in vietnam it seems to me that market is just a code word for fragmenting social labor into independent private labors and robbing society of the ability to plan the economy in a rational way according to real needs id like someone to point me to something that disproves this suspicion though
socialism,not_removed,this is a crude answer but i mean it literally because markets are stupid they are mechanisms that follow inhuman rules with hardly any input from human or any form of intelligence by using markets as a mechanism for distribution you alienate the autonomy of humanity in deciding where resources go you leave it up to cold calculation for the accumulation of capital it is an inhuman system and doesnt utilize the intelligence and values of humanity itself
socialism,not_removed,i agree actually the only private financial instutions that weathered without bailouts were internally democraticcollectivised credit unions mutuals building societies et al and worker coops and espos have also seen success a private sector without heirarchies is not a horrible idea and because collectively owned enterprises dont run along these lines a lot of them tend to cooperate anyway as opposed to competing and resorting to cutthroat business methods that exploit their members i wouldnt mind a mixed economy with a democratic state controlling public natural monopoliesnecessities like health energy etc and a strong welfare system to alleviate the problems with these markets
socialism,not_removed,alright thanks ona side note i was scrolling through the pdf and im wondering what you as a leninist i presume given your flair think about their critique of lenin democratic centralism and soviet democracy in general
socialism,not_removed,we would still be producing for demand and not for necessity how is necessity measured if not by demand the issue is not demand vs necessity if such a thing can even be shown to make sense as a dichotomy the issue is production for exchange vs production for use markets are generalized exchange
socialism,not_removed,on the other hand like most socialists i would favor needsbased provision of stuff like healthcare education childcare basic food and housing etc my ultimate problem with this is precisely that a person on the ground floor is going to have a better idea of what they need depending on their situation than a centralized authority whos only seeing things on a macro scale i can get the problem of dependency on a capitalist and imperialist run government being a problem but i dont understand why if you are going to give people an assured level of living standard anyway that you just not trust them with it themselves especially if such a system can be more comprehensive no means testing means no people falling through the cracks and can assist in making our current paradigm of economics free market more incentivized to be humane during a transitional period to something better ie the products of ones labor can be aimed to fill the needs of everyone rather than just middle class and up
socialism,not_removed,sorta like cooperatives
socialism,not_removed,credit unions generally weathered the financial crisis relatively well because of their small size and more limited exposure to mortgage securitizations not because of any adherence to democratic principles the two largest ones were bailed out and many were still forced to adopt predatory loaning practices to stay competitive with bigger banks the same is generally true for worker coops but with some caveats coops are not isolated from the capitalist economy and must compete on par with other firms and so are subject to the same pressures and are exposed to the same risks in the business cycle there are plenty of worker coops and movements of coops going bust during times of crisis its just that downturns tend to be less hard on the average worker in a coop because theyre more quick to cut salariesbenefits of the top earners in management than lay off large amounts of workers although this happens including in largermore successful coops like mondragon
socialism,not_removed,i found it interesting but not totally convincing ill have to read it again to remember what problems exactly i had with it but i vaguely remember thinking it was a bit too nitpicky to be persuasive to me
socialism,not_removed,i am not sure i follow do you mean production for personal use so everyone produces their own stuff instead of exchanging it maybe lets take an example to make clear what i meant i am talking about market demand so the spending power consumer are willing and able to focus on a product as an example there is an extrem demand for stuff like anti aging cream or anti hairloss shampos its more reasonable to produce these luxury products in a market if there is a demand for it then to cater to the basic needs for survival of the least wealthy elements of society in catering to the first consumer group there are bigger profits to be made its a reasonable businees descion to cater to them and not to produce the most basic means to survive as an extreme people in countries who are affected by a famine to produce dogfood because there is a higher demand spending power asking for these products then there is an economic demand for food because people lack the spending power to create a demand i guess if you dont like the characterisation of demand and necessity you could also distinguish between products necessary for survival and luxury products a market doesnt make that destinction but a necessity based economy would always produce products necessary for peoples survival before producing luxury products
socialism,not_removed,but cooperatives exist under the current system of private property
socialism,not_removed,do you mean production for personal use no i mean production for use by society at large so everyone produces their own stuff instead of exchanging it no everyone produces stuff everyone uses stuff no exchange necessary its more reasonable to produce these luxury products in a market if there is a demand for it then to cater to the basic needs for survival of the least wealthy elements of society what is to be produced and in what quantities under socialism should be a social function not an economic one that is the economy does not determine what to produce or how much based on the operating principles of the economy rather people determine what to produce or how much based on the operating principles of society and their community this of course can be informed by economic functions but should not be determined by them as an extreme it people in countries who are affected by a famine to produce dogfood because there is a higher demand spending power asking for these products then there is for a economic demand for food because people lack the spending power to create a demand this is why you produce for use instead of exchange if you are producing dog food because there is increased demand from wealthier countriesterritoriespeople within your own community ie that is where the money is and because money is also seen as the mechanism by which you acquire food rather than by producing food this contributes to the chaos of the system this is why the market must be abolished this is how you end up with cash crop colonies and the such which are wholly dependent on singular economic functions and unable to maintain themselves without politicaleconomic dependence that said obviously there are some areas which are better suited for producing certain things than others particularly with agriculture im not exactly going to be growing oranges up in alaska but the extremes you talk about are exacerbated by markets production for exchange not for use in markets there is no necessary correlation we may produce dog food all day which could be sold and rot away in a warehouse for years this leads to overproduction and fragility within the economy as a whole a market doesnt make that destinction but a necessity based economy would always produce products necessary for peoples survival before producing luxury products the distinction is unnecessary it is not for you to determine what i need vs what i want all that is needed is to remove production for the purpose of exchange and the lunacy of any particular region only producing mass quantities of dog food while others produce food capable of sustaining humans will be laid bare or in a economic sense having demand not defined by spending power but actual necessity but again this is a failed dichotomy actual necessity is not the issue we dont need a bureau of people to determine what is actually necessary you simply need to remove the market ie generalized exchange the clearest mechanism for doing this is the abolition of money and the institution of an alternative accounting system which tracks production consumption and remuneration without the need for exchange between two entities
socialism,not_removed,indeed but markets are not married to the idea of privately held means of production ie you could abolish private property have nothing but worker coops and localized communes but still have a market free or regulated
socialism,not_removed,what is to be produced and in what quantities under socialism should be a social function not an economic one thats what i meant to bring across this is why the market must be abolished yes actual necessity is not the issue we dont need a bureau of people to determine what is actually necessary you simply need to remove the market ie generalized exchange i was making a counter example and not a description of how a perfect economy should work a markt is not able to function in a way to produce according to the social function of a product its always the economic demand with other words the spending power focused on a product
socialism,not_removed,ie you could abolish private property have nothing but worker coops and localized communes but still have a market free or regulated how precisely do you propose to exchange that which is not produced by privately held means and therefore not owned what is the incentive to exchange if i or my worker coop do not control the machines we use why should we exchange anything for them do i also have to exchange my labor power if so who decides what and how much of what to exchange for it if they dont own that thing why should i exchange with them
socialism,not_removed,how precisely do you propose to exchange that which is not produced by privately held means and therefore not owned what is the incentive to exchange it is owned collectively by the workers that produced it earnings would be split among the firm by default it would be an equal distribution if i or my worker coop do not control the machines we use why should we exchange anything for them im not sure i follow are you asking why would they trade some means of production for something else that would depend on the situation they would own collectively the machines they use so collectively or democratically you and your fellow works would control the machines
socialism,not_removed,it is owned collectively by the workers that produced it earnings would be split among the syndicate by default it would be an equal distribution how are earnings determined are you only paid if your products sell does everyone have to agree in order to hire someone new could they choose to hire someone without them being an equal partner receiving equal portions of earnings and having equal say in decisions im not sure i follow are you asking why would they trade some means of production for something else im asking how they would secure the means of production its not clear to me how what you are describing is any different than the collective private ownership in a company by multiple shareholders they would own collectively the machines they use i know you keep repeating this but its not clear how its different from collectively owned private property today simply because you add more private owners doesnt make the property any less private how does a new worker come into this system can they be refused ownership by the existing owners if not what right does collective ownership afford the owners so collectively or democratically you and your fellow works would control the machines which gives us what rights also you never answered the question of whether or not one could exchange labor power in the market without private ownership you propose
socialism,not_removed,how are earnings determined equal proportion by default adjustments made democratically are you only paid if your products sell by the coop itself yes does everyone have to agree in order to hire someone new this is a good question id argue that adding a new worker is a more complex topic than i could completely cover in this post but largely such decisions would be made democratically internally im remaining broad because different democratic systems are best in different contexts though it might be beneficial to have some external pressures on coops to integrate new workers im asking how they would secure the means of production number of different possible ways some i prefer over others but last resort options are things im not against to ensure a fair system with minimal misery its not clear to me how what you are describing is any different than the collective private ownership in a company by multiple shareholders participation in a coop dictates whether you hold any shared ownership so you couldnt keep earning a stake if you did not work can they be refused ownership by the existing owners if not what right does collective ownership afford the owners yes however see my mentioning that there would probably need to be external pressures to regularly integrate new workers or to have new workers start their own coops i think a ubi is necessary in any system and this is one reason why id support a ubi that it makes starting a coop possible for people starting from scratch which gives us what rights democratic control over how the capital is used again i remain broad because in many respects it depends on the type of industry worker coop is in also you never answered the question of whether or not one could exchange labor power in the market without private ownership you propose are you asking if a person can be hired no you cant hire someone at least not without integrating them into the worker coop which you could argue isnt really hiring at all im sorry if im wrong in what you are asking here im admittedly a lay person not well read i came to my current conclusions through debate and cognitive dissonance i started out a clueless liberal for the most part in many ways and remain open minded and scientific about things im not an ideologue
socialism,not_removed,equal proportion by default so even if i work twice as hard as someone else by default we receive the same earnings adjustments made democratically then it is possible for me to receive less than the value ive actually created though it might be beneficial to have some external pressures on coops to integrate new workers would this be a state function number of different possible ways some i prefer over others but last resort options are things im not against to ensure a fair system with minimal misery to be clear i was asking after the formation of this new society not during some revolutionary period you seem to explain that ubi would make it possible for someone to start a coop participation in a coop dictates whether you hold any shared ownership so you couldnt keep earning a stake if you did not work could a coop decide to change this for example could they allot lifelong stake for retirement or pensions what about permanent stake that could be passed to heirs democratic control over how the capital is used in every sense though this is what im trying to understand what are the limits of this control and if there are no limits to this control how does this differ actually from collectively owned private property you say there can be markets without private property and im trying to understand why on earth someone would exchange anything they do control for something they dont control under the current system it is completely possible for me and a bunch of friends to get together and create a company in which we all decide democratically how to operate we invest together in the requisite productive forces including other labor and receive control over shares proportional to our investment why would we elect to hire anyone if their hiring entitled them to the same rightscontrol for which we had to exchange some existing portion of our wealth why would we provide them equal earnings from the total revenue if we can provide them reduced earnings temporarily why not permanently if we operate a company that produces insulation what is our incentive to do anything other than fetch the highest market price for insulation we afterall choose who we produce for exchange with etc are you asking if a person can be hired no you cant hire someone so again this is a function of a state to prevent this at least not without integrating them into the worker coop which you could argue isnt really hiring at all ive yet to understand what integrating them into the worker coop entails what i have so far understood is that theres a market which generally would imply that i exchange things for other things i get ubi which enables me to start a coop so lets maybe just walk through a simple example lets say i want to start a restaurant i presume begin by saving a portion of my ubi until i have enough built up to lease a space lease or buy requisite equipment etc and initially provide myself with the raw materials to be able to actually feed customers so ive done this and immediately am confronted with the realization that i cannot possibly do all the work myself i might be able to handle all the cooking if i start small enough but someone needs to greet and seat people take their orders fulfill basic requests water refills questions on the menu taking their order etc so now i need someone else to work there what does that hiring process look like i advertise that i need workers and if i accept them im the only employee currently so democratic decision is unilateral yes they get equal share and equal earnings cant i refuse to accept them unless they will take lower earnings or have less say can the state force me to allow them to work there can the state dictate their share of earnings or their percentage of say why did i sacrifice a portion of my ubi to do this
socialism,not_removed,part of so even if i work twice as hard as someone else by default we receive the same earnings then it is possible for me to receive less than the value ive actually created if a coop decides to not take into account for such things within their own structure then yes but this assumes coops would be static and not be incentivized to reward those that work more or take on more responsibility even capitalist firms adjust for such technicalities and they are much less incentivized to be even though even with adjustments there is always an underlying problem of surplus extraction from an owner class its more a means to be pragmatic to have things simply start out equal in terms of stake in terms of what would be legally acceptable perfect is the enemy of good in this case you cant engineer something with such precision on such a mass scale for every technicality especially from a central hub that lacks an understanding of all the microscale things and only sees the big macroscale picture its simply more efficient to let people always on the ground floor make decisions about the structures they work in its largely the same for why i favor a ubi over means testing in most cases you seem to explain that ubi would make it possible for someone to start a coop yes a ubi is a single policy that does a number of different necessary things all at once but two things in particular i see as valuable for market libsoc though it isnt necessarily considered strictly a socialist policy is that itd act as society investing in itself and the creation of more coops best case scenario for the creation of a coop in this case would be that the ubi simply acts as means for supporting workers as they either find unused capital or build their own another use is to utilize some of each of their ubi to pay existing coops for the creation of new capital they wouldnt be paying to own this newly created capital in the sense of permanent ownership only for the creation of it and as long as they use this capital and not simply sit on it its theirs to use for the purposes of producing for the coop could a coop decide to change this for example could they allot lifelong stake for retirement or pensions what about permanent stake that could be passed to heirs passing on to the heirs of workers would be problematic in the long run and end up extracting wealth from future workers in a coop so no the idea of some sort of builtin savings for retirement is something i dont immediately see any problems with but i cant see some sort of contract where you are ensured any stake after retiring being workable or something id want to see anyway it wouldnt be particularly important seeing as one would get a ubi and id still believe in an added system to provide some extra for those with disabilities ie a separate meanstested though nonstrict system that i think would be set up for anyone who cannot work due to being medically frail or who have a disability and need extra income to help cope in every sense though this is what im trying to understand what are the limits of this control and if there are no limits to this control how does this differ actually from collectively owned private property im not explicitly sure what types of limitations you are asking about i already stated probably the most important limitation that you cant own capital that you do not work on or produce with if you think this is private property still than i simply disagree from what ive been told at least private property in marxist terms is property one can control without actually working said property that is property owned by a class of people that simply own things and use their control to coerce workers into working for less than they produce so they can skim off the top or to simply control and then seek rent from others for permission to use the capital they control or even not even offer renting as an option and utilize ones control over property to manipulate markets with artificial scarcity you also could not simply sell or rent the capital when you are done using capital it will simply be open to someone else who might need it if you want to make the claim that it isnt public property than yes i would indeed agree with you there a person outside of the coop could not legally forcibly insert themselves for instance into a coop that explicitly doesnt want them involved clarification when i say they lose participationbased ownership i dont mean they literally lose ownership the moment they decide to go to sleep at night or take breaks or whatever obviously there would be a line they could cross in terms of amount of idle time that would trigger the switch back to claimable public property though perhaps some sort of capital sharing system could be worked out between different coops you say there can be markets without private property and im trying to understand why on earth someone would exchange anything they do control for something they dont control could you be more explicit here give me a perceived example of someone trading something they do control for something they dont in such a system under the current system it is completely possible for me and a bunch of friends to get together and create a company in which we all decide democratically how to operate we invest together in the requisite productive forces including other labor and receive control over shares proportional to our investment yes technically speaking you could however under the current system you would also have to contend with a market dominated by a capitalist class of people you would also be able to hold onto the capital you constructed indefinitely and restrict its usage even after you ceased production or rent it out producing nothing but earning an income via your control of the capital i find these aspects to be ethically wrong why would we elect to hire anyone if their hiring entitled them to the same rightscontrol for which we had to exchange some existing portion of our wealth your coop does not exist in a vacuum not taking on new workers might seem like it benefits a coop in the short term but in actuality by taking on new workers you strengthen your coops ability to produce and meet demand and furthermore not taking on new willing workers opens you up to blossoming competing coops formed by the very workers you refused to integrate and keep in mind the capital you constructed or paid for is not permanently yours in the sense that you could sell it or rent it if you add new workers you could usereserve more capital why would we provide them equal earnings from the total revenue you wouldnt have to but if getting new workers to join is important to you your coop will be incentivized to pay that worker a fair amount remember workers wont be desperate for work as an existential threat because they will still have a ubi to fall back on and your coop wouldnt and couldnt realistically hold a monopoly on capital to do the exact same type of work since capital ownership is more ephemeral due to it being based on participation if we can provide them reduced earnings temporarily why not permanently your coop would be in many ways roughly just as replaceable to the worker you are attempting to screw as the worker is to you in terms of capital and income it would also seem fairly unlikely to me that an entire coop would be collectively sociopathic enough to want to try and squeeze new workers like that and on a massive enough scale throughout the entire economy that a worker wouldnt be able to find a coop not doing this on top of that the new worker would gain a equal vote within the coop they wouldnt lack at least some influence over the internal democratic system they joined if we operate a company that produces insulation what is our incentive to do anything other than fetch the highest market price for insulation we afterall choose who we produce for exchange with etc this is a problem with markets markets arent perfect i dont even love regulated markets i accept them as simply better than the alternatives like a completely topdown commanded economy and as more pragmatic and doable than any hypothetical economy structures ive heard about dont get me wrong a command economy can reach theoretically better outcomes than any market but topdown economies are prone to collapse or simply morphing into state capitalism they are unworkable however unless you have some sort of godlike asi running it a gift economy is also interesting though i dont know enough about it to know how well itd work or how itd incentivize production at all
socialism,not_removed,part of so again this is a function of a state to prevent this yes though enforcement is always a tricky issue for preventing any economic law breaking itd be similar to laws on tax evasion child labor paying under min wage that we have today ive yet to understand what integrating them into the worker coop entails what i have so far understood is that theres a market which generally would imply that i exchange things for other things i get ubi which enables me to start a coop so lets maybe just walk through a simple example lets say i want to start a restaurant i presume begin by saving a portion of my ubi until i have enough built up to lease a space lease or buy requisite equipment etc and initially provide myself with the raw materials to be able to actually feed customers so ive done this and immediately am confronted with the realization that i cannot possibly do all the work myself i might be able to handle all the cooking if i start small enough but someone needs to greet and seat people take their orders fulfill basic requests water refills questions on the menu taking their order etc so now i need someone else to work there well no you wouldnt need to spend any money to lease space renting would be impossible as thatd require there to be an owner not using a space but you would likely need to spend money from your ubi to develop space unclaimed by any coops what does that hiring process look like i advertise that i need workers and if i accept them im the only employee currently so democratic decision is unilateral yes they get equal share and equal earnings cant i refuse to accept them unless they will take lower earnings or have less say you can refuse to take on other workers if you think they are requesting something unfair to start with and vice versa the default of equal earnings is only there in case no negotiations are done at all they will always have equal say in how things are run once they are involved however can the state force me to allow them to work there can the state dictate their share of earnings or their percentage of say neither would be necessary edit it hopefully and probably wouldnt be necessary why did i sacrifice a portion of my ubi to do this most people inherently want to meaningfully contribute to society or their community but want to do so in a self directed way youd certainly not sacrifice your ubi if your literal only interest was power wealth or improving your living standard significantly over others that last thing would be a possible benefit though if people really demanded the products or services that your work provided
socialism,not_removed,participating in antifascist demonstrations does not always require that one mask up and be ready to throw down just look at the protests at berkeley where comparatively few folks showed up in battle gear those willing to risk arrest for engaging in confrontational actions opposing fascists are indispensable but that doesnt mean there is no place for anyone unwilling to take part in those actions from how you explain it you dont seem to consider yourself ideologically disjoint with antifa you just believe your specific contribution would be better spent in dialogue than militancy if thats the case showing up to counterprotests and engaging the liberals there with a more radical rhetoric than they may be used to hearing could have incalculably beneficial effects do you live in a major metropolitan area
socialism,not_removed,first find solace in knowing that leftist organizations are growing because of the failure of the democratic parties looking at the growth of rsocialism alone is uplifting second there is much more to socialism than violent resistance that antifa participates in community service leftist party participation and even talking with others on politics are ways to get the word out with out the aggressive approaches of debates protests or punching nazis it is a frustrating time but the struggle comes with the territory of being a socialist fascism is a result of the failure of capitalism and the harder it fails the harder the oppression will be until people rise against it some places are more zealous than others where people will die for the preservation of capitalism whereas france has been rioting since the dawn of time just know that there are other places struggling with these powers the same way and your individual mental strife is shared with many frustrated people in one way or another our time will come and the way to prepare and seize it is to stay organized enlightened and engaged

socialism,not_removed,what jesus taught was communism christianity is not communism it just uses his name
socialism,not_removed,i am likely the wrong person to try and sum this up as i am not christian but i do know someone who is with revolutionary ideals and i hope to help basically its the idea of returning to an ideal of christ rather than how the church has been appropriated since especially with how jesus is used by many evangelical christians in the us to suppress the poor coming from a north american perspective churches were once the main tool of organizing working class people for labor causes they still are but it got reversed and is mainly used to suppress labor causes in the us now by taking the protestant work ethic and beating the working class with it believe it or not even some churches such as pentecostal that are often portrayed as incredibly conservative and right wing were once community centers for civil rights and workers rights groups im talking during the and the depression as i understand it communistsocialist christians in north america view it is as both taking back their communities from right wing influence and getting back to what they believe are the roots of christs message easier to put a camel through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven and all that etc think of it as taking back christ for the working people so yeah its less about marx and what he thought and more about finding similarities between the proletariats cause and the message of christ my friend does do more intellectual analysis because he studies theology and also has some interesting thoughts on the necessity of religion in combating fascism there is an idea that many fascists especially modern iterations of fascists take a technocratic and materialistic worldview in other words humans are just cogs in the machine and to be used as parts this partially explains why some lower class people selfdestructively support fascism because they see themselves as less than human and just part of the machine they may not benefit from it but those who are superior will and those are the people who deserve wealth and a good life as a christian he believes that by emphasizing that people are more than just parts that there is a sanctity to their existence that christian socialism can combat such selfdestruction and emphasize that all of humanity is deserving of equal care and cooperation i am atheist and disagree that its absolutely necessary because i find that sort of argument through humanism but i do find his argument intriguing and useful some humans just need that opium so why not steer it in a positive humanistic direction yes before anyone says it i do understand and agree that christianity contains inherent patriarchy and social stratification all im saying is that i do find it interesting and perhaps even positive to give christian communists a chance for reformation after all a baptist preacher brought socialized healthcare to canada again i cant say this with authority and do not mean to speak for all revolutionary christians this is just my meager personal experience with it if he has the time i may try and steer my friend here so he can speak directly
socialism,not_removed,without looking it up do you know which one of marxs works the quote opium of the people is from marx isnt the original inventor of communism and christian communism isnt a marxist tendency although it incorporates marxist theory i dont really understand why christian communists owe you an answer to this post since you dont demonstrate a firm grasp on the basics of christian communism the history of communism generally marxs critique of religion or even the context of the quote thats central to your oddly demanding question
socialism,not_removed,no what jesus of nazareth taught was the love of poverty and the general disdain of life
socialism,not_removed,thanks for the answer its interesting to see that christian communists are the people struggling to help the average worker while trying to live under what jesus actually said rather than being some conservatives that threaten everyone with hell
socialism,not_removed,a contribution to the critique of hegels philosophy of right posthumously published full context the foundation of irreligious criticism is man makes religion religion does not make man religion is indeed the selfconsciousness and selfesteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself or has already lost himself again but man is no abstract being squatting outside the world man is the world of man – state society this state and this society produce religion which is an inverted consciousness of the world because they are an inverted world religion is the general theory of this world its encyclopaedic compendium its logic in popular form its spiritual point dhonneur its enthusiasm its moral sanction its solemn complement and its universal basis of consolation and justification it is the fantastic realization of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality the struggle against religion is therefore indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion religious suffering is at one and the same time the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions it is the opium of the people the abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness to call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions the criticism of religion is therefore in embryo the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo
socialism,not_removed,you could have just said its not that marxistinspired and left it at that but thanks for being salty
socialism,not_removed,his acts are communistic loaves and fishes the sacrifice of one for the many
socialism,not_removed,this is probably my favorite passage of marxs writing thanks for posting it
socialism,not_removed,youre welcome
socialism,not_removed,his speech last night was phenomenal if anyone hasnt seen it yet
socialism,not_removed,i loved the guy in stranger things now i love him in real life too
socialism,not_removed,there are some stranger things going on in my pants seriously this dude is rad
socialism,not_removed,comrade harbour
socialism,not_removed,i have even more respect for david harbour than i did before and i didnt think that was even possible
socialism,not_removed,god i wish he could say this without linking to media matters david brock is behind media matters and holy fucking shit fuck that source even if what he said rings true
socialism,not_removed,its like brecht and cradle will rock
socialism,not_removed,i am reminded of how the belgian revolution which separated belgium from the netherlands started in the theater now mind you this wasnt a socialist movement more a nationalist one but my point is that theater can spark the fire when there is enough flammable material laying around we need more of this
socialism,not_removed,i hadnt seen his speech yet but i saw someone earlier describe him as speaking like a nut job on a different subreddit i had suspected it was hyperbole from someone who probably supports the current changes that are going on but in reality i didnt get the sense that they got at all he knew he was saying a message that was more political in nature than what these awards shows want to be expressed in these acceptance speeches and that they really limit their time to speak when accepting awards anyways so of course he is going to be loud excited and forceful with the message he is trying to get across i thought it was definitely a positive message and while there is much more to be said for all the public to hear on the matter in different settings i do believe that little ways to put the message out there like this speech are what can get the ball rolling and the conversation started in peoples minds which is the first step for any revolution of thought to take place which would precede a revolution of action
socialism,not_removed,this is an amazing speech you could really feel the energy and passion so much better than the other milquetoast political speeches the liberal celebs have been giving meryl streep comes to mind also love the implicit pro nazi punching line near the end
socialism,not_removed,oh neat that was super encouraging
socialism,not_removed,holy fuck that speech gave me goosebumps
socialism,not_removed,whats the connection between david brock and david harbour
socialism,not_removed,we should learn from any revolution even if we dont agree with it id prefer a revolution that ends with democracy like the american or belgian revolutions rather than one that ends in dictatorship like the russian or chinese ones
socialism,not_removed,its not the word is being used in appropriate context glad to see this sort of thing from a person with a lot of mainstream appeal could start some useful conversations
socialism,not_removed,capitalism tries so desperately to strip the passion from us that when we see someone who genuinely cares about the world we see it as in some way wrong
socialism,not_removed,also love the implicit pro nazi punching line near the end its great because it works on so many different levels
socialism,not_removed,this is the link from the david harbour tweet the source is david brocks media matters
socialism,not_removed,belgian revolution was not democratic they gained their independence and crowned a king
socialism,not_removed,lol america isnt democratic
socialism,not_removed,how is being used in the right context hes a straight white cishet dude using that word like it was unnecessary
socialism,not_removed,this is why i dislike postmodernism or at least what its become cynicism has become a way to make fun of the system while also telling people to shut up and sit down because real change is foolhardy
socialism,not_removed,i think the us was more progressive than other countries of its time definitely not by modern standards but it was a step forward the czar was obviously a shitty situation but it just replaced one dictatorship with another
socialism,not_removed,i mean it ended up with something closer to democracy than the french revolution did the french revolution wound up trading one despot for another
socialism,not_removed,shrugs all those revolutions i get them mixed up sometimes
socialism,not_removed,i dont disagree with that
socialism,not_removed,i seem to remember another white cishet man who used this word in the same context
socialism,not_removed,this sub bans a girl for putting cat ears on a cartoon because she thinks its cute for being sexist but upvotes a cisdude using whores in a pejorative sense brocialists brocialists never change
socialism,not_removed,new sincerity is where its at
socialism,not_removed,oh like years ago ok
socialism,not_removed,what in the flying fuck is brocialist about banning catgirls for being sexist at least try to make a coherent narrative
socialism,not_removed,yep so many goddamn brocialists its annoying tbh this sub isnt inclusive at all
socialism,not_removed,cool i knew about httpsenwikipediaorgwikinewsincerity criticism of postmodernism but i didnt know there was a word for it i think postmodernism had some good ideas not viewing history as a grand narrative but as contextual and relative but its been too overshadowed by irony and cynicism which ironically sends the message that societys narrative is bleak and unsolvable
socialism,not_removed,i disagree lenin and stalin were just dictators and what followed them was just a dictatorial oligarchy in my mind dictatorship of the proletariat is a metaphor for the workers having democratic and legislative power over their communities having one man or one institution control everything is the opposite of socialism to me
socialism,not_removed,how are you an ancom if youre calling the ussr an actual example of dictatorship of the proletariat
socialism,not_removed,of course hes not relevant any more god this kind of iconoclasm is so boring
socialism,not_removed,this makes cri
socialism,not_removed,you took the point out of what i said completely its not black and white
socialism,not_removed,weve known this for a long time this is another piece of evidence to add to the pile
socialism,not_removed,of course we can share land land commonly owned fairly equally partitioned and democratically allowed is shared
socialism,not_removed,you literally cannot share space where are you this very moment billion people cannot be there at once
socialism,not_removed,there is plenty of livable human space proof humans live on the planet the problem is what method we use to share it do we share it on the basis of money or do we democratically allow it your argument is a strawman there is plenty of inhabitable land for all
socialism,not_removed,i didnt know marxists wanted to move literally every human being on earth to the same house
socialism,not_removed,i think youre missing my point there is always relatively better land it just dawned on me that land is the most problematic resource we have
socialism,not_removed,as i said to another poster i think youre missing my point there is always relatively better land it just dawned on me that land is the most problematic resource we have
socialism,not_removed,you dont have a point
socialism,not_removed,how do you decide who lives where in a communist state
socialism,not_removed,communist state is an oxymoron we dont
socialism,not_removed,work with me here how is housing allocated or determined in a communist society
socialism,not_removed,everyone needs a house so if theres houses give people a house if theres not build some more houses
socialism,not_removed,youre still missing my point but i dont get the sense that you give a shit anyway thanks for indulging me
socialism,not_removed,socialism isnt really compatible with private ownership on any level besides your own personal belongings
socialism,not_removed,socialism abolishes private property so there would be no such thing as businesses of any size
socialism,not_removed,i also think people should have the opportunity to run a business if they want to they can run all the businesses
socialism,not_removed,the only way you could implenent any resemblance of that idea is through turning all businesses into worker coops but having a small business owner with traditional private ownership of the mop still maintains the class system they are members of the petite bourgeoisie
socialism,not_removed,socialism is the abolition of the present state of things there are no businesses in capitalism not big or small
socialism,not_removed,well there is market socialism where basically all forms of private business are turned into worker cooperatives though that still has some issues such as anarchy in production and monopolization of resources
socialism,not_removed,being self employed would be fine its just hiring other people and exploiting their labor for surplus profit that would be anti socialist you may be interested in mutualism or market socialism
socialism,not_removed,you deleted a post from earlier i took a moment to reply to it so sorry if this seems unwarranted but id rather my thought not go to waste i think thats a little too much if i have an ideahobby that is profitable why shouldnt i profit from it what do people do for work thinking in terms of monetary profit is antithetical to socialism the profit of an idea or hobby should be in the liberty of being able to enjoy your idea or hobby without threat of starvationhomelessness if it doesnt yield any monetary gain people do whatever they like for work because that is what the predication of liberty is
socialism,not_removed,a one person small business should be ok in my opinion if you want to cut hair or drive an ice cream truck or push a fruit cart i think its great some people dont work well with others and they only want to work independently not with any boss even at a democratic worker managed place im like that sometimes i think it would become a problem if the business gets big or if you try to hire others to exploit their labor without giving them an equal share of decisions as for businesses with hired employees i think it really is not compatible with the theory of socialism but im also not aware of any socialist parties that are aiming to end all wage labor anytime soon should they come to power i think that would be more of a philosophical guiding principal and a long term goal that we could aim for if society is ever ready for it right now society is not ready for that big of a change but it is something we could transition to over time
socialism,not_removed,it still has some issues like the fact its literal capitalism lol
socialism,not_removed,if you want to cut hair or drive an ice cream truck or push a fruit cart i think its great just as long as you dont expect any state subsidies since these century professions cant probably offer that much in terms of income even working as an independent programmer would severely limit the scope of your activites
socialism,not_removed,if you have ideahobby but dont have capital with which to start the business why should your neighbor be able to exploit your labor and profit out of you doing this hobby really you would be better off reading our sidebar resources a bit or checking out to get some background on what socialism means but one key thing to understand is that socialists are against anyone owning the means of production business assets private property whatever you want to call it other than the people who are working to produce value themselves if you want to own a business where other people do work for you and you get a profit off of their work after you pay them their wages then you are engaging in economic exploitation and we arent in favor of that if you see a societal need and gather together a group of people to fill that need without you needing to be the monolithic owner then yeah sure most of us are in favor of some version of that
socialism,not_removed,what do people do for work as i see it and there are socialists who disagree with me people should allocate their labor in the way that benefits the commune the most in return they draw from communal stores without any sort of cost if you have a good idea you make it known and it can be used to benefit the commune maybe it sounds like youre getting the short end of the stick but if everyone contributes ideas and inventions freely you will reap lots of benefits as well edit the commune could also decide to give more resources to people they think contributed above and beyond what was asked in times of abundance as long as it was decided in a democratic fashion
socialism,not_removed,i ask the same question why should you individually be able to profit off of collective knowledge and social production
socialism,not_removed,i dont think anyone here would necessarily object to one reaping all of the benefits of ones own work when one puts in all the work and their own capital necessary to produce said thing ie painting songs tchotchkes etc socialists would more have a problem when you own the capital to produce an item but dont actually put in any labor to create it hence taking away the surplus value your workers who created the item for you it might have been your idea but you should really only earn however much it took to create the idea and whatever other labor you put into it not extract it from anyone whos working beneath you
socialism,not_removed,i think you should read up on the anarchist societies of revolutionary spain it would explain very well how a particular type of socialistic society would function in a way that is efficient innovative and egalitarian
socialism,not_removed,market socialism is not the same as capitalism
socialism,not_removed,suuuuuure
socialism,not_removed,thats fine as long as you dont employ people youre good
socialism,not_removed,and why should we bother to fight for a better society where wages still exist where people do work for only a fraction of it in return while you accumulate the profit of their work due to you being a greedy narcissitic prick
socialism,not_removed,not everyone will agree with that but objectively speaking how would you protect this idea of yours enough that you can profit off of it
socialism,not_removed,youre speaking in abstracts care to give an example i dont mean to sound confrontational at all but i think we could do a better job of dissecting this if you were to provide some example
socialism,not_removed,the biggest point of socialismcommunism is that everyone lives in equal luxury regardless of these profit potential ideas the reality is that its widely probabilistic that you wont have a good idea and that if this is allowed like in capitalism someone else will be making the profits and hence taking resources out of the community youre questions are basic ones of why use socialism in the first place im sure you could find this info quite easily
socialism,not_removed,you do realize that many of the socialist thinkers who came before marx some before he was born were market socialists right one of the early groups of socialists who came before marx were called ricardian socialists they advocated for a market economy with worker cooperatives providing the goods and services as opposed to traditional capitalist firms
socialism,not_removed,something has existed for a long time so its immune to criticism
socialism,not_removed,jesus you just love capitalism huh employment wages freelancers whatever you want to call it its capitalism
socialism,not_removed,if you want to live a life of material luxury why should others give up their labor assuming this is a socialist collective the ingredients you used for your drink would have been provided by the commune and socially produced you would essentially give out the share you earnedthrough collective work out in exchange for other peoples earned share i have no problem with simple voluntary trade among individuals the issue is the way in which exclusivity is enforced through private property with forces involuntaryunequal trade
socialism,not_removed,you shouldnt be doing better thats the point again this goes back to socialism basics you being born lucky enough to have this profit potential is reason enough for you to be able to take resources out of the community of people who just happened to not come up with some business idea id say try to think of it like mentioned above in that you have to be born lucky why is it just that you live in luxury whilst the less fortunate people sit in poverty have some empathy you deserve to have your luxury from your soda sales while people die from starvation and preventable diseases in undeveloped countries solely because thats the life they were born into this is a more extreme example but you can scale this down and it applies everywhere we completely have enough resources available to humans to where everyone can live safely and comfortably if we instill socialism i dont understand how people dont come to this conclusions i was extremely lucky to be born into a developed country unusually intelligent through no effort of my own to an upper middle class family its still easy for me to see that socialism is obviously the best system and that the human species as a whole is who we should be making policy for not letting you take all the resources because idk i just think i should do better than those less skilled edit just wanted to point out that i realize your position wasnt such a strong one against socialism i was more ranting to antisocialists in general
socialism,not_removed,you can criticize it all you want that doesnt mean you can engage in revisionist history to change what socialism has been about
socialism,not_removed,i think we should be building up a powerful network of local assemblies labor unions debtors associations consumers councils schools farms community groups worker owned companies environmental defense groups racial justice groups gun clubs and other groups like that also we should work to get our people elected to local government and try to take over city councils like that that way when the overall system starts to crash well be ready to defend ourselves from fascism and actually well be in a position to govern and provide basic services because well have built a material basis for power that is rooted directly in the grassroots community im not sure if you call that revolution or reform its something like revolutionary goals with some nearterm reformist tactics it really is a question of socialism or barbarism at this point either were going to win and create a sustainable livable socialism or else the system is going to collapse into neofascism which is kind of already happening you can see it with the rise of the far right everywhere with climate change and other social stresses like mass migrations the system is becoming more unstable all the time organizing for revolution at this point means organizing for self defense to fight against climate change and to fight for liberty against authoritarianism tldr organize in networks so when the system collapses we can be in charge instead of the fascists is that revolution or reform
socialism,not_removed,revolution because if reform worked wed have more socialist states all reforms that get passed are under siege constantly such that political and economic power are expended maintaining the victories rather than pushing for more eventually the reforms are overturned and the ruling class attempts to declare it a victory for the worker all rightwing groups have to do is obstruct and stall as long as they can and when things fail to improve or to improve quickly enough they will declare the policy has failed reform is ultimately the approach of kindly asking the exploiting class to be less awful
socialism,not_removed,revolution because as marx said the working class cannot simply lay hold of the readymade state machinery and wield it for its own purposes bourgeois states have countless barriers against the transformation of bourgeois democracy into workers democracy what is needed is organs of peoples power like those which existed in the paris commune early soviet russia and revolutionary catalonia which forcefully transform society until the need for such force is gone what would exist after that is a free association of producers otherwise known as communism
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,this is a false dichotomy revolution can be reformist or it can be insurrectionary really all that matters it that we achieve our goals without compromising our ideology
socialism,not_removed,personally id say both only to the extent to when reform fails only revolution will be able to pick up the slack to which can only go so far before inevitably failing unless it somehow works by chance which would be preferable but highly unlikely edit why am i getting down voted i spoke out against reform lol i thought it was common to see non violence as preferable but unlikely to succeed as history would tell
socialism,not_removed,theres a really good book that irons our the revolution sides argument by rosa luxembourg just by the way
socialism,not_removed,the method to achieve social ownership of the means of production is irrelevant to me i am open to both possibilities of reform and revolution but right now i do not think that we have fully exhausted the possibility of striving for reform the reason is that we would need support from the majority of the population whether we opt for either reform or revolution a major reason to be wary of revolution is because we have mostly had bad experience of it before the most longterm results having been authoritarian and undemocratic forms of pseudosocialism revolutions are also rarely without bloodshed and casualties making it desirable to avoid so my first priority is reform but that if there is uncontrollable opposition from the ruling classes we should then opt for revolution the reason why i call myself a democratic socialist is because i think it captures a plurality of views on socialism from revolutionary to reformist centralized to decentralized from representative to direct democracy to anything inbetween from planned to cooperative market socialism the positions one can take a numerous but my position is that we need to be pragmatic and adopt a more fluid approach to all these various positions we are not epistemologically perfect we do not necessarily know what is the best approach nor do we know what will actually work in the end this is why i opt for pragmatism and argue that we need to use careful trial and error to discover what is the most feasible result we can achieve the goal here is to best coordinate our values needs desires goals dreams hopes etc which is a complex endeavour which perhaps includes a lot of contradictions between our various ends this requires humility and an openness about the potential limits of our political endeavors
socialism,not_removed,reform although with a democratic mass process i believe it should be our ethical maxim to reduce violence where it is unnecessary because of this i have a certain disdain for violent revolution as it often embraces unnecessary violence and likely reinforces state power
socialism,not_removed,that is revolution the marriage of the idea to revolution to the idea of violence shuts revolutionaries off from a whole battery of other tactics that are useful in bringing revolution which is really the collective act of rejecting and replacing political authority
socialism,not_removed,thats just determinism
socialism,not_removed,i support reformism i would say that the problem is not that reform does not work but rather that the general population has never been properly convinced that socialism is viable there has always been a large portion in every western country who have believed that socialism cannot be achieved class consciousness is the problem not reform itself if class consciousness was high we would likely be able to change the system from within current representative democracies i believe people would be tenacious and patient against any procapitalist opposition and that class consciousness would ensure that people see through their tactics past socialists revolutions in the century eg russia china cuba etc are also a reason to be wary of revolution they have without exception led to disappointment and failure not to mention the loss of countless lives suffering and lack of freedom so has capitalism but revolution and its aftermath—including the risk of being hijacked by authoritarianism—is often such a grisly measure that it should be considered a last desperate resort
socialism,not_removed,yes violence is only ethical if it is abstracted behind law
socialism,not_removed,it means im an anarchist whos also a humanitarian also my statement isnt really jargon its simple af it doesnt matter if the revolution is peaceful achieved through reform or not achieved by insurrection all that matters is that it happens and that it succeeds thats all i care about
socialism,not_removed,as a maoist you should know that pretty well
socialism,not_removed,if your marxism is deterministic then its vulgar and second internationale marxism humanites liberation is their own doing to paraphrase marx
socialism,not_removed,first off i dont call myself a maoist second of all i know full well that violence is something that is always connected to politics but im not the one talking about an ethical maxim of violence and thinking just because you use the law to enforce violence it is somehow more ethical
socialism,not_removed,ok sure revolution vs reform is a false dichotomy because revolutions can be either violent or nonviolent but all that matters is that they succeed without compromising our goals and ideals hows that
socialism,not_removed,then give me one good reason why we shouldnt have an ethical maxim to such a degree it doesnt mean violence is only justified when it is abstracted behind the law its merely a point of ethics i dont see any good grounds to justify the overuse of violence
socialism,not_removed,i think its unfair to just blame this one on mls even if lenin and stalin did their part because the second internationale had some really weird and vulgar theories that became wide spread orthodox marxists are just as bad when it comes to marxism as mls comintern still upheld that revolution was something that the people had to do and not something history will just bring though you still had leftcoms and so on in comintern so it wasnt all lost
socialism,not_removed,of course using too much violence is bad but i dont think the question of ethical maxim is part of the reform versus revolution debate its either legitimized or nonlegitimized violence
socialism,not_removed,you seriously think socialism has a bad connotation just because of venezuela in the us venezuela is just the latest country reactionaries use to stir up red scares to answer your question i think we stick to socialism because workers control of the means of production is a bit too verbose for repeated use if you insist on a replacement how about proletarianism or laborism
socialism,not_removed,eh no i like socialism because its about a socialized economy venezuela is further demonstrably not socialist unless you believe promises are always carried out which socialist history and for that matter mainstream politics prove to be horribly wrong nonetheless at least redditors actually do believe that according to a dumb but wellmade meme on rlibertarian
socialism,not_removed,i think socialsm is being used wrong all over the world were calling getting services you pay for with your taxes socialized but we dont own them any more than we own roads or schools thats not socialism and calling it that distracts from the issueneed for social ownership
socialism,not_removed,if you dont mention socialism the reactionaries will make sure to say what youre proposing is socialism even if it isnt but thats another matter i think its fine to introduce socialism by saying taking control of the means of production and so on but it would be a mistake to not identify what youre talking about as socialism
socialism,not_removed,that implies that worker control of the means of production is all i want which it isnt it also implies that worker control of the means of production is all there is to socialism which it isnt it also ignores the fact that no matter what we call the movement to abolish capitalism the bourgeoisie are going to try and turn it into a bad word
socialism,not_removed,i despise the words proletariat and bourgeois the needless foreign words sound a bit pretentious imho i prefer underclass and upperclass
socialism,not_removed,theyre useful for the specific contexts we use them in theyre not needless
socialism,not_removed,i prefer people and pigs we cant fight the enemy until we dehumanize them
socialism,not_removed,except underclass and upperclass can refer to any number of different classes depending on the historic circumstances whereas proletariat and bourgeoisie refer to specific classes within capitalism that is why we use those terms whats wrong with saying working class anyway
socialism,not_removed,i have to agree its not that are wrong they are just so overused in the wrong context that they became the technobable of socialism
socialism,not_removed,i see your point i just dont like using them i feel like a right twat
socialism,not_removed,im fine with either its just the gratuitous french i dislike probably my southern post sep upbringing
socialism,not_removed,i have to say that the technobabble of socialism is dialectics tankies just use it as a way to criticize your arguments without debunking them

socialism,not_removed,i used to work with low income kids while sending my own kids to a how can i put this without sounding like an asshole a very exclusive preschool everyday id look at these kids at school who were relatively speaking like royalty and wonder about the futures of those few kids who would receive every educational advantage available to the children in our society meanwhile id see kids of the same age living in foodinsecure homes no college funds no trust funds no network of well connected friends to offer them jobs right after they return from a year traveling abroad do i think the children of affluent parents are smarter no do i think the kids of financially struggling are dumber no but they certainly have a much much harder struggle to ever reach a position to promote scientific advancement
socialism,not_removed,stephen jay gould evolutionary biologist raised by a marxist father he was an alleged marxist his entire life although he never referred to himself as one and said once that dialectical thinking should be taken more seriously by western scholars not discarded because some nations of the second world have constructed a cardboard version as an official political doctrine he wrote the mismeasure of man which explains how iq tests measure education and not intelligence and also eviscerates arguments for racial superiorityinferiority so much for gould and his work
socialism,not_removed,i always thought a parallel must run between technological development and overall literacy and education rates it is just a game of numbers the greater percentage of those with understanding of math and science the greater chance for discovery an anecdotal example was my great grandfather who started life as an poor illiterate farmer in europe he came to the usa in his late teens and by chance landed a job at an oil refinery the man actually taught him self how to read and draft blueprints while never really knowing how to readl in the end he actually designed a new gasket that completely prevented leaking during an integral part of the refining process i wonder what someone like that could have achieved if they were given an education now multiple that number by thousand or millions and think of all the intelligence going to waste
socialism,not_removed,its kind of depressing to think that some of the worlds greatest poets artists musicians actors comedians etc will remain undiscovered simply because they did not have sufficient means to be able to pursue their passions as proper careers
socialism,not_removed,serious question how does socialism prevent people from working shitty jobs andor wasting their potential after all capitalism or socialism someone has to work on farms and in factories right
socialism,not_removed,oh yeah if theyre so smart why arent they rich america
socialism,not_removed,here is a piece gould wrote about kropotkins mutual aid httpswwwmarxistsorgsubjectscienceessayskropotkinhtm
socialism,not_removed,reminds me of one of my favorite lyrics from propagandhi better lives have been lived in the margins locked in the prisons and lost on the gallows than have ever been enshrined in palaces
socialism,not_removed,and the millions who have died in pointless imperialist wars so that mediocre bourgeoisie can get richer
socialism,not_removed,how do socialists feel about private gun ownership

socialism,not_removed,reminds me of the story of west indian archie from the autobiography of malcolm x he ran numbers and never once had to write them down he could keep any combination of numbers for all of his clients in his head with perfect recall when it came time to tell the bookies what his customers had asked for in a society that valued black lives as human lives or tried to educate its citizens with the utmost zeal west indian archie could have been a great mathematician or engineer but instead he was reduced to being a low criminal because of american and capitalist prejudices
socialism,not_removed,i cant wait to see how rall handles this one
socialism,not_removed,i think that nearly everyone is capable of more mentally challenging activities than picking fruit or factory machine operating how do we balance the fact that people need a chance to stimulate their minds with the fact that someones gotta do the less desirable jobs personally i think everyone should have to pay their dues to society by spending a few years in their youth working some sort of labor job to help society function but also have an opportunity to do more meaningful things as well
socialism,not_removed,was working with a client years ago several teams were collaborating on a problem solving initiative all levels of employees were interspersed among the teams a member of the custodial staff big quiet native american male was on the same team as the general manager of the plant the young man was quite astute and was coming up with workable solutions that the rest of the team couldnt figure out including several engineers it was great to see the plant manager take a keen interest in the young man and schedule an appointment following the workshop he recognized the mans talent and wanted to help him if he could

socialism,not_removed,httpiimgurcomrgugtrqpng i hope you like it
socialism,not_removed,thats an extremely solid quote i assume he has some written works can anyone recommend
socialism,not_removed,cool i had this thought too but didnt know there was a quote attached to it now i know
socialism,not_removed,this is always my argument for maximal support for all you never knew who those people youll be bringing education will become
socialism,not_removed,isnt this the same sort of logic used by people who oppose abortion
socialism,not_removed,while i do agree with the sentiment i just cant help but feel like hes saying this in reply to some one that was wondering whether brain mass had any correlation with einsteins intelligence so sort of like the scientificpolitical equivalent of walking into a conversation about the new episode of game of throneswalking deadwestworldwhathaveyou and stating that there are children starving in africa
socialism,not_removed,instead of talent doesnt he mean promise
socialism,not_removed,inspiration for invention comes with time and devotion to exploration its only recently that even a percentage of the population has the means necessary to have the time to wonder
socialism,not_removed,a quote right there
socialism,not_removed,i get his sentiment but it is kind of a strange thing to say i mean how many of them would have been hitlers and how many of them would have been normal people like i think it doesnt really matter if they would have been einsteins to think it is fucked up that people are economically enslaved
socialism,not_removed,cant you be equally interested in both
socialism,not_removed,how can we prevent this from happening again edit they banned me for this question reason troll
socialism,not_removed,maybe we will all be able to realize our true potential once we no longer have to work to survivewhen augmentation becomes mainstream it will be a necessity to have universal basic income or risk having a complete social upheaval which wouldnt be that bad either p
socialism,not_removed,a decent argument hundreds if not thousands existed probably at the same time
socialism,not_removed,i meaneinsteins father was financially secure but to imply that a jewish kid who grew up in late germany was privileged seems like a stretch even if he was privileged though intelligence isnt the most important trait a person can have ambition and work ethic are equally important factors in terms of contribution to society this is probably an unpopular opinion
socialism,not_removed,and war

socialism,not_removed,as someone who has made a living selling art and recently failed an art class drawing i completely understand
socialism,not_removed,is that john krasinki with a mustache
socialism,not_removed,my thought is about all of the people simply in impoverished nations and even then in remote areas women in islamic nations children who die of preventable diseases there definitely seems to be a better alternative one that could lift everyone up
socialism,not_removed,a great quote from a great scientist one of the greats of paleontology
socialism,not_removed,shit maybe im one
socialism,not_removed,this would make more sense if einstein was born affluent he wasnt its not like he got where he was by having connections this kind of thinking makes a lot more sense in the business and especially finance sectors but not science gould sometimes lets his ideology take precedence over intellectual honesty he is probably aware of all the twin studies and stuff that have convinced most of the people who study it that intelligence not to mention other more nebulous traits like risktaking and entrepreneurial drive are more hereditary than environmentbased steve jobs was adopted by a blue collar family but his grandfather was a self made millionaire there were those babies switched at birth where the son of millionaires raised by poor people became a wealthy business owner and the son of laborers raised by millionaires became a plumber genetic inheritance matters it would be nice if we all lived in an egalitarian pipe dream but we dont and wanting it to be so or even pretending that it is so wont will those conditions into existence
socialism,not_removed,think of all the manhattan projects never started shameful edit but truly comrade downvoters why do people have to be potentially extraordinary to warrant equality sympathy attention andor concern fight for the average fuck even the below average of all people no tokenism and no cure for cancer people just people like regular boring eating breathing people no conditions in other words i am less interested in the talent of people
socialism,not_removed,general human progress scientifically and technologically is what frees up the workforce from blue collar to white collar socialism unfortuantely isnt as powerful as capitalism at generating technology or science i like the idea of socialism due to our human values but capitalism is a much better catalyst to progress even if its messy
socialism,not_removed,im a housekeeping manager and work with people who had a bad inner city school education some of the people that work for me have more mental capability than me but you can just tell that they didnt get a proper education its sad
socialism,not_removed,i feel this way too i am studying engineering and somewhere in my head i know that if everyone would have the same agvantages that ive had in my life then there is no way i would have gotten into this program or stayed in school
socialism,not_removed,reminds me of a comic i saw of two kids climbing stairs too big for them one was struggling to climb and the other was stacking dollars to make smaller steps to help him climb easier
socialism,not_removed,how can i put this without sounding like an asshole hate the game not the player
socialism,not_removed,no but they certainly have a much much harder struggle thats optimistic i appreciate the american dreamvibe of the statement that they could manage it if they just struggled enough but lets tell it as it is a child which does not have extraordinary talent will not make it because under those circumstances it can not make it there are children where its not about a harder stuggle anymore most of them dont make it because they cant make it struggle has nothing to do with it
socialism,not_removed,think about the access the kids have to the parents of their school friends the kids in the poor schools will probably only know kids with parents in typical jobs like working in stores factories etc if theyre in a job at all whereas kids in better schools will know kids whos parents are doctors or business people or florists or politicians oryou get it thats why poor kids will have a much harder chance of breaking out because their weak ties parents of other kids are from very similar backgrounds and thats why kids at better schools have more opportunitiesbecause of the varied nature of their networkits all about the network when youre a young kid opportunities not talent is a limiting factor source i was a very poor kid who won a scholarship to posh school hated every second of it but years later realised why i escaped a life of drudgery and my friends at the poor school didnt
socialism,not_removed,even with affirmative action these kids are still at a huge disadvantage just being in an environment where everyone else doesnt do well academically is terrible for ones education
socialism,not_removed,it is very good that you are self aware it is vital that your children understand this as well i got very lucky with my son as he is very aware of how lucky he is and doesnt take anything for granted
socialism,not_removed,no network of well connected friends to offer them jobs right after they return from a year traveling abroad this is what sucks the most yet no one ever admits they got that nice job because of who they were friends with

socialism,not_removed,wait so why do you go to such a classist preschool
socialism,not_removed,outlier by malcolm gladwell really opened my eyes the poverty divide really creates two americas
socialism,not_removed,what do you think the solution to this problem is
socialism,not_removed,arent preschool kids just eating paste and making turkeys out of handprints how exclusive can a preschool be do most preschools have a basement coal mine
socialism,not_removed,go on to episodes and afterward the first podcast is literally your story and the next two are it extrapolated
socialism,not_removed,i worked years in public city schools and it is just heartbreaking these kids arent any less smart than the kids in other schools but they are all going to leave school less educated than the kids miles up the road in the suburbs
socialism,not_removed,i tutor for hire and this strikes home to me as well the kids who live in gated communities their whole life go to the schools that cost several multiples of a new car each year and have never spent any time in proximity to scarcity they take little pride in the practice of getting better treat writing memorization or preparation as a nuisance to be dodged or passed through as quickly as possible i need those kids to pay my bills but i find satisfaction in helping the guy or girl grinding for that scholarship make it into a college without tuition or get into the marines or just make it into a trade school and through high school
socialism,not_removed,how did you know they were mentally more capable than yourself
socialism,not_removed,yes iq tests were designed to prove racism was genetically based

socialism,not_removed,any sources on that
socialism,not_removed,this is an incredibly interesting read thanks for sharing im just getting into socialism a lot more seriously of late could you perhaps share your experience of getting into these sources in a way that would benefit a newcomer or is it all selftaught
socialism,not_removed,propagandhi writes really insightful stuff shame the style of music turns so many people off
socialism,not_removed,propagandhi this is a great name
socialism,not_removed,it obviously goes far beyond a single group in a single war but i often think of all the great poets and writers that were lost in the first world war the collective loss of life and loss of creativity is just disgustingall wars are bankers wars
socialism,not_removed,bullshit jobs that come along with capitalism yup like insurance companies
socialism,not_removed,we could still have a hundred types of toothpaste innovation would likely increase not decrease
socialism,not_removed,yeah imagine the advances if all human potential is given the resources to flourish thats socialism
socialism,not_removed,the thing about people like httpsenwikipediaorgwikisrinivasaramanujan is that their contributions to human knowledge and the resulting technological progress that we make can have a cascading effect across society that could improve the lives of billions
socialism,not_removed,this should really be stickied tbh e oh wait its in the stickied post derp
socialism,not_removed,under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated by force if necessary karl marx

socialism,not_removed,socialism always has and always will support the right of the workers to be armed

socialism,not_removed,well the only reason a lot of those jobs exist is because its cheaper to pay a fella a pittance than to buy the big fancy machine

socialism,not_removed,people removed socialism well shit
socialism,not_removed,wanna elaborate on that seems like youre fairly certain youre an expert
socialism,not_removed,the difference is that those slaves in the fields were born already kinda an important distinction

socialism,not_removed,capitalism or the reactionary brigading on this post
socialism,not_removed,the point of the quote isnt to shit on einstein for not having earned his education rather its saying we should fight for education as a right of all people because it a would give the world thousands more einsteins and b is the right and good thing to do
socialism,not_removed,this is officially my new copypasta to adress fundamental misunderstandings of socialism for future reference this isnt exactly an educational sub and is more suited to questions like yours but i can still answer this so i might as well the system you describe as socialism is called social democracy social democracy is a form of capitalism capitalism is an economic system with private ownership of the means of production anything used to make products or perform services and markets social democracy is capitalism but the state redistributes more wealth to people with less and funds some social programs eg singlepayer healthcare for example bernie sanders is a social democratic politician and sweden is a social democratic country socialism as it is understood on this sub is a system that ends private property and empowers the working class before i explain further it is important to point out that socialists draw a firm line in between private property and personal property your personal property is simply all the things you personally use your place of residence your toothbrush and your car are all your personal property socialists are perfectly content to let you do whatever you want with these things we have no interest in collectivizing them or anything like that private property is different private property is property that you dont use a factory or any other means of production is private property a condo that you dont live in but rent for a profit would also be considered private property socialists dislike private property and the way it is enforced by the state socialists want to end private property because we assert that it allows the propertied class to exploit the working class and get rich without doing anything of value socialists hold that the only thing that holds inherent value is labor so when the boss or the landlord or other propertied individual makes a profit without contributing labor they are stealing that profit from the worker in response to this problem socialists propose the economy should be managed democratically and workers should own the means of production directly so in that sense socialism is much less about taking money from those who contribute and giving it to those who dont and much more about taking property from those who dont contribute and expropriating it among those who do
socialism,not_removed,does this not make a great argument for capitalism if youre really talented you can actually go out and be whatever you want to be with hard work not really at all the way it really works in a capitalist government is if youre talented and connected sometimes you dont even need the talent you can be whatever you want to be i would also think that with socialism people with the talent of einstein would have little incentive to leave the sweatshops or their fields to take any kind of risk since theres little reward and socialism runs a lot off of the spoils system this is assuming the only reason someone would leave a bad job is because of monetary rewards even in a capitalist government people will leave a job for one that pays the same sometimes even less if its livable because its in a preferable field or offers better benefits a major goal of a socialist government would be to implement a ubi universal basic income which gives every citizen a livable wage without having to work without the need to work people can focus on what theyre talented in without fear of losing their home if it doesnt work out wed be looking at a cultural boon as artists would be able to create philosophers could debate and scientists could experiment without having to split their efforts on their passion and work with a ubi in place people wouldnt need an incentive to leave a job other than personal preference i hope i answered your questions properly and if not ill try again just ask
socialism,not_removed,no because your class which is a circumstance of birth and not something you earn determines the amount of opportunity and resources you have to develop your talents capitalism is not meritocratic far from it in fact if youre born rich youre overwhelmingly more likely to die rich if youre born poor you will almost certainly die poor what does increase social mobility and you will see this if you look up the statistics is generous social welfare programs like those found in scandinavian social democracies in these countries it is easier to move both up and down the social ladder these countries are still operating under capitalism so they can only minimize the inherent inequalities of opportunity rather than completely abolish them but they are restraining the nature of capitalism through redistributive programs and in doing so are becoming more meritocratic which should prompt some soulsearching from advocates of the laissezfaire approach
socialism,not_removed,does this not make a great argument for capitalism if youre really talented you can actually go out and be whatever you want to be with hard work someone explain how this makes socialism look good considering capitalism was the thing that put those slaves into bondage in the first place no it doesnt i would also think that with socialism people with the talent of einstein would have little incentive to leave the sweatshops or their fields to take any kind of risk since theres little reward and socialism runs a lot off of the spoils system einstein was a socialist so hed disagree with you
socialism,not_removed,theres plenty of motivation outside of the profit motive check out the gnu open source manifesto for some more thoughts on this httpswwwgnuorggnumanifestohtml
socialism,not_removed,state owned collective
socialism,not_removed,no one claimed to be able to change the basic facts of economics we propose dignified safe labor with ample opportunity for the education required to have an impact comparable to einsteins
socialism,not_removed,no more like people dont labor for hours a day in slavelike conditions
socialism,not_removed,in a facist authoritarian state somewhat similar to the us putting the natives into camps and continued genocide albeit slower and japanese internment and sacco venzetti and the murder of fred hampton oh shit the us has social security you guise usa is totally socialist

socialism,not_removed,of course capitalism is great just look at green energy being completely sabotaged the ridiculous degree of planned obsolescence in consumer goods and corporate lobbying in general in all seriousness your point has been true in the past even marx and lenin would agree with you at a certain time but capitalism has outlived its usefulness to humanity
socialism,not_removed,capitalism is just good at furthering innovation that is profitable if it benefits humankind it is a nice feature
socialism,not_removed,socialism unfortuantely isnt as powerful as capitalism at generating technology or science i mean do you have any evidence for this no country have ever achieved socialism but if we look at the few countries which have attempted to get there we see the ussr going from a semifeudal backwater to the first country to space in a few short decades seriously they went from the level of development of essentially england to sputnik in years we see startling and ridiculous levels of social development from where they started likewise cuba developed novel cancer vaccines and beat the us in terms of literacy and infant mortality rate all with an economic base on par with that of ecuador and decades of an active economic blockade by its nearest neighbor and the greatest economic power in the world meanwhile rd in capitalist countries if it has any involvement in the capitalist mode of production at all occurring within a private business happens in secrecy with data not being shared and a ridiculous amount of wasted labor discovering the same things over and over again creative energy and research funding is invested in discovering how to make a product most reliably fail within a given timespan so that consumers will need to replace it how to design a package to make a product most attractive what colors and words to put on a box etc none of this seems like an ideal system for science
socialism,not_removed,gonna need a source for inst as powerful as capitalism at generating technology or science to be clear there has never been a society in which the means of production were owned democratically

socialism,not_removed,somewhat true but lets not pretend the struggles under feudalism are anything similar to what we have being poor youre relatively far better off than poor people from any other time period not an excuse but a reminder not to overdo the hurr durr nothings changed everything is still shit rhetoric
socialism,not_removed,john dewey democracy and education ch vocational aspect of education summary a vocation signifies any form of continuous activity which renders service to others and engages personal powers in behalf of the accomplishment of results the question of the relation of vocation to education brings to a focus the various problems previously discussed regarding the connection of thought with bodily activity of individual conscious development with associated life of theoretical culture with practical behavior having definite results of making a livelihood with the worthy enjoyment of leisure in general the opposition to recognition of the vocational phases of life in education except for the utilitarian three rs in elementary schooling accompanies the conservation of aristocratic ideals of the past but at the present juncture there is a movement in behalf of something called vocational training which if carried into effect would harden these ideas into a form adapted to the existing industrial regime this movement would continue the traditional liberal or cultural education for the few economically able to enjoy it and would give to the masses a narrow technical trade education for specialized callings carried on under the control of others this scheme denotes of course simply a perpetuation of the older social division with its counterpart intellectual and moral dualisms but it means its continuation under conditions where it has much less justification for existence for industrial life is now so dependent upon science and so intimately affects all forms of social intercourse that there is an opportunity to utilize it for development of mind and character moreover a right educational use of it would react upon intelligence and interest so as to modify in connection with legislation and administration the socially obnoxious features of the present industrial and commercial order it would turn the increasing fund of social sympathy to constructive account instead of leaving it a somewhat blind philanthropic sentiment it would give those who engage in industrial callings desire and ability to share in social control and ability to become masters of their industrial fate it would enable them to saturate with meaning the technical and mechanical features which are so marked a feature of our machine system of production and distribution so much for those who now have the poorer economic opportunities with the representatives of the more privileged portion of the community it would increase sympathy for labor create a disposition of mind which can discover the culturing elements in useful activity and increase a sense of social responsibility the crucial position of the question of vocational education at present is due in other words to the fact that it concentrates in a specific issue two fundamental questions—whether intelligence is best exercised apart from or within activity which puts nature to human use and whether individual culture is best secured under egoistic or social conditions no discussion of details is undertaken in this chapter because this conclusion but summarizes the discussion of the previous chapters xv to xxii inclusive
socialism,not_removed,meet the new boss same as the old boss
socialism,not_removed,exactly
socialism,not_removed,i agree with this statement
socialism,not_removed,the average or below average wealthy child will succeed while the above average poor child might succeed
socialism,not_removed,upward mobility is still possible iirc people born into the lowest economic quintile have a chance of ending up in each of the other quintiles in the us
socialism,not_removed,sorry to be blunt but you are talking bullshit here structural problems like certain classes lacking access to reasonable early education are undoubtedly responsible for a huge part of the wealth gaps we see growing in modern societies those structural problems are a result of capitalist social relations what you call wealth gaps would even exist if everyone got what is called a decent education today simply because capitalism depends on exploiting the majority of the population regardless if they have a ba or not
socialism,not_removed,its not what you know but who you know thats commonly said around the area where i live though ive never heard the few wealthier ones say it
socialism,not_removed,nature is half the battle but nuture is the other half everybody who is born without some kind of mental defect has the capacity to do great things but if they spend their time especially early years doing labor instead of learning or being trained to learn better they will fall behind theres always fringe cases martin shkreli son of janitors evil genius starting to work at a hedge fund at probably currently worth in the million george bush golden spoon with platinum details last in his graduating class in uni but the vast majority of kids are just sponges waiting for wisdom to pour itself upon them
socialism,not_removed,if traditional measures of success in our modern culture income power etc are correlated with intelligence they are not
socialism,not_removed,watching the way the wire dealt with this and seeing it first hand to a degree i think another major portion is how supported the kids are at home ive heard countless stories of kids getting bullied from fellow students and their parents if they push to do well at school that to me is heartbreaking it requires that much more work to just break even let alone succeed and while yes intelligence may be hereditary to a degree that doesnt mean a higher quality education wouldnt end up benefiting and increasing the overall quality of life lower income kids can experience but the biggest and most paramount question is how to adjust the parents and peers of those children who want to achieve but are held back in various ways there are some interesting studies about the benefits of forced integration but parents are so terrified that the bad apples will taint their schools that it almost never succeeds
socialism,not_removed,the correlation between wealth and intelligence is tenuous at best trump has the vocabulary of a preteen and the attention span of a blueberry scone but he has both wealth and power
socialism,not_removed,i also suspect lead in the poor kids water may have a factor
socialism,not_removed,most people actually tie success to work ethic from what ive seen persistence and motivation is usually what successful peoples greatest asset is intelligence is just a bonus
socialism,not_removed,a large component of intelligence is hereditary a large component of every aspect of every creature on earth is hereditary this is due to evolution
socialism,not_removed,income power etc are correlated with intelligence they are not

socialism,not_removed,in order to find a solution we need to properly identify the exact problem were looking to solve and we need to fully understand what factors influence cause the problem without fully understanding the problem our solutions may not actually solve the problem so we have a mix of people with varying levels of intelligence creativity and ambition some very intelligent and creative people have no desire to be put into positions that could contribute to society some very unintelligent people are highly motivated to seek positions of power for example i frequently hear people complain that more scientists and engineers should be put in political positions so why are we not inundated with scientists and engineers running for political office from my experience the scientists and engineers ive met have communicated a general sense of avoidance for political positions which they say is pretty universal in their fields so you have a group of arguably intelligent and creative people who could contribute to society in a particular way who choose not to how do you solve that next you have the problem of a lack of resources being made available to the people who are intelligent and creative and want to contribute to society then separately you have unintelligent people in positions of influence and authority who actively work to prevent resources from being distributed to others any solution is likely going to be complex because the problem is complex

socialism,not_removed,many people believe that the first years a persons brain is developing are among the most important i used to be a preschool teacher at an exclusive preschool the level of training experience and education that the teachers there had might surprise some people yes we were making turkeys out of handprints but we called it fostering spacial reasoning skills promoting social development etc we tried not to let them eat too much paste if you google the benefits of a good early childhood education you might be surprised its pretty well documented that it correlates with future academic success
socialism,not_removed,ill check it out thanks
socialism,not_removed,deleted
socialism,not_removed,that conclusion is highly controversial many of those studies support the hereditarian view while many also support the determinist view the sample sizes for those studies are very small and most of the information is not publicly available i wouldnt hang my hat on any of those conclusions
socialism,not_removed,because only reasonably wealthy people can afford to adopt i use reasonably wealthy a little loosely here but my point is that children are almost never adopted into disadvantaged households because the up front costs are high and the vetting process is rather classist
socialism,not_removed,out of curiosity what have you been doing since
socialism,not_removed,if we plan the economy we educate everyone and divide labour how we want who is we who decides who pulls the short stick having more skilled laborers doesnt eliminate menial jobs
socialism,not_removed,how is that relevant
socialism,not_removed,have you looked at the side bar
socialism,not_removed,when starting out just read what takes your interest dont get too pigeonholed into this or that part of socialism some socialists can be very dogmatic and try to hand you a list of must read books while denouncing others as reformist or revisionist you said you liked the piece about kropotkin so maybe you could start by reading kropotkin mutual aid and conquest of bread are both excellent personally i tend towards libertarian forms of socialism so i go with kropokin goldman bakunin and for more modern anarchist thought the theanarchistlibraryorg peter gerderloos and alfredo bonano are two personal favorites its also worthwhile having a reasonable understanding of marx but you dont need to plough through all three volumes of capital there are plenty introductory materials that cover the key ideas pretty well like the other person said you will find a bunch of stuff in the sidebar
socialism,not_removed,the old lie dulce et decorum est pro patria mori
socialism,not_removed,im not sure any conflict was as much about defense of empire as the first world war loyalty to king and country was high in the early and so many supposedly humanist liberal writers and even people further left were actually pretty happy to go to war when it broke out of course once it dragged on for a while people realized how naive they had been anyway i have a deep morbid love for wwi
socialism,not_removed,and now the biggest creative minds works for corporations doing ads or products designed to sell merchandising
socialism,not_removed,more probably died under kim il sung than kim jong il honestly also north korea hasnt claimed to be marxist or socialist in decades
socialism,not_removed,just as horrific whats your point
socialism,not_removed,oh god thank you i thought i was the only who realized this its straight up welfare for the insurance companies and their people extracted from everyone else in many cases providing no value in return i dont mind the concept of insurance one bit but ffs it shouldnt be a publicly traded thing aimed at optimizing profits
socialism,not_removed,without insurance our modern economy and its advancements would not exist crop insurance can singlehandedly change a countrys economy to an advanced trajectory do some research on the push to grow crop insurance markets in the developing world
socialism,not_removed,why would we need that tho improving products and meeting peoples needs is not the same as diversifying options for the sake of profit and competition capitalists would tell they do the former when they actually do the latter
socialism,not_removed,whos doing the giving
socialism,not_removed,sounds like a swell man id like to subscribe to his newsletter
socialism,not_removed,brilliant
socialism,not_removed,hmm didnt expect to like anything in this sub
socialism,not_removed,damn that makes two things i agree with marx on first being his issue with public education being an indoctrination factory that is depositing knowledge rather than teaching critical thinking
socialism,not_removed,i ask because my bernie supporting friends are anti gun so is bernie which was all i needed to hear
socialism,not_removed,as an irish person that looked very different to me than the intention i thought the inla were being tongue in cheek

socialism,not_removed,mental health requirement is a terrible idea basically institutionalizing ableism as a tool for the state to use to disarm the workers charge people you dont like with mental illness and you can keep the god fearing americans armed while those commies are locked up
socialism,not_removed,are we being brigaded were always being brigaded
socialism,not_removed,this is the subs toprated post of all time so yeah theres some measure of extra publicity going on
socialism,not_removed,id like to think its because people are realizing how fucked capitalism is
socialism,not_removed,dawkins actual work as a biologist is something more socialists and anarchists should reference honestly he helped establish that theres a genetic predisposition within social species to behave altruistically and cooperatively which is to say helps dispel the endless claims that its human nature to be selfish and greedy whatever the man himself might believe about this or that his work supports our views
socialism,not_removed,honestly dawkins bigotry has been way overblown hes your standard guardian liberal hes not the patron saint of the altright like so many people paint him to be
socialism,not_removed,lol nice figures did you get those from the black book of communism cuz by the same metrics capitalism is responsible for twice as many deaths in the same time period
socialism,not_removed,ummm capitalism causes creates warsdeathmaterialism you know how capitalism really helped the native americansfactory workersanyone not rich or well off yeah what i said is bullshit just like your statement you cant attribute deaths to an idea or form of governingonly the people using those ideas
socialism,not_removed,i think his point was that socialist societies dont have some magical way of accurately determining talent to assume that all talented people would be properly recognized as such in a socialist society may be overly optimistic
socialism,not_removed,how
socialism,not_removed,i believe you mean fully automated luxury gay space communism
socialism,not_removed,what editoh i meant prevent people from being denied the chance to benefit society
socialism,not_removed,saved thanks for this
socialism,not_removed,so this would mean that every person would own their own house am i understanding that correctly
socialism,not_removed,what if it turns out that most people really arent that creative and instead of artists creating philosophers debating and scientists experimenting you just have a bunch of worthless citizens
socialism,not_removed,huh
socialism,not_removed,thats how i found it
socialism,not_removed,i am not the person you replied to but i also came in from rall thank you for links
socialism,not_removed,those drones are installed with clever fairness devices where only the stupid kids who didnt deserve to earn enough to feed themselves or to pay to have their life restarted in privilege are targeted not like socialism would ever produce amazing innovations like these drones
socialism,not_removed,funnily enough there are pretty solid iq studies which show that racists are more likely to have a low iq than nonracists try showing them those then all of a sudden they become way more adept at questioning the validity of iq testing
socialism,not_removed,that is indeed possible the advent of automation will probably drive us to something new out of necessity at some point
socialism,not_removed,since you were so polite if we assume venezuela is not real socialism what makes you think that real socialism would be significantly different in outcome venezuela has significant policy that parallels that of socialism what would be so significantly different in real socialism as compared to venezuela that would drastically change the outcome to something positive
socialism,not_removed,how are you doing now im and have no idea what im doing with my life
socialism,not_removed,that is a beautiful piece of writing thanks for sharing it
socialism,not_removed,true dat bud came from a scrapingthebottom middleclass family made it into a cheme program and couldnt cope took me years of working as a tradesman to get to the point where i could face college again turns out environmental egn was my place and were my time chin up man dont beat yourself up all the smack your classmates are telling you thats stressing you out its just bs they are pushed to the limits and dont want you to know how much they bleed too
socialism,not_removed,awh friend you totally belong when you graduate you will know for sure
socialism,not_removed,feeling like you dont belong is the hallmark of any good scienceengineering program hang in there we actually have a syndrome named after it httpsenwikipediaorgwikiimpostorsyndrome
socialism,not_removed,dude we all feel like we dont belong welcome to the family
socialism,not_removed,hey show them whos boss and maybe teach them a thing or two in the process its good that youre there
socialism,not_removed,thats really sad to hear i hope you find a way to find pride in yourself dont you ever consider going back to school
socialism,not_removed,i just read a study the other day that people in feudal societies had more time off than we do how fucked up is that
socialism,not_removed,well one thing that medieval peasants had over us modern day people is they really only had to work with the flow of agriculture so after planting and harvest they had almost half of the year off
socialism,not_removed,we also have far more poor people in general though its just a matter of time just because you have access to modern resources doesnt mean your policies arent outdated also do you really think our current politicians would dislike us moving closer to feudalism we live under the control of pseudo feudalists the only difference is that we still have enough control to stop them from going out of control for now they are working pretty hard to both reduce our power and our education while also spewing more lies
socialism,not_removed,youre relatively far better off than poor people from any other time period perhaps in the west but in africa and asia people were certainly better off under their respective modes of production there was no such thing as mass starvation there were freak weather events that caused famines we live in an era where there are hundreds of millions of people perpetually starving that couldnt really happen in previous modes of production
socialism,not_removed,except for all the actual workers that make everythinghint made in china its not bad to you westerners because you dont see it
socialism,not_removed,a lot of the fuedalist peasants werent socially alienated though i doubt they had suicide rates like ours
socialism,not_removed,that is not a reason to give up on further progress
socialism,not_removed,whyd you have to bring hodor into it
socialism,not_removed,i think thats a large part a result of industrialization
socialism,not_removed,yea a lot has changed but everything is still shit
socialism,not_removed,if they are being honest they also include a lot of luck
socialism,not_removed,at the end of the day work ethic only matters if you get lucky if no one ever notices or gives you a chance you can work as hard as you want and as diligently as you want and still not move upwards
socialism,not_removed,huh of course they are if you eliminate the extrema education level is a decent proxy for earnings potential while you do get privileged people being forced through university and higher when they are by merit not capable i contest that they are the exception and far from the rule or do you think the average doctor is of similar intelligence to the average janitor
socialism,not_removed,go to one of those poor schools you mentioned and youre gonna have all the ethnic diversity you could ask for i just feel like youre being hypocritical you could probably pay a teaching wage with the tutition for that school send her to public school and donate
socialism,not_removed,that is weird and hilarious
socialism,not_removed,this is amazing where did you find this and are there more like it
socialism,not_removed,this is one of the best things ive ever seen
socialism,not_removed,i dont understand why youre being down voted youre right
socialism,not_removed,oh my gosh this all of my kids teachers had a masters or a phd some also lectured to undergrads regarding early childhood development they traveled abroad every summer to learn the latest in the latest reggio emilia approach
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,you do having more skilled laborers does eliminate menial jobs part of the reason we havent automated much of our economy is because paying unskilled labourers is often much cheaper a decreased amount of unskilled labour and an increased skilled labour force will allow for massive amounts of automation thus we can free up a large amount of people that would be needed for that labour instead of having a farm employ twenty people it can now employ two finding those two shouldnt be that hard many people enjoy growing food and those two jobs would most certainty be skilled labour
socialism,not_removed,do you understand what division of labour means literally who is we socialist society the distinction between worker and capitalist exists in capitalism only there is no compulsion to have a class of people dedicated to menial jobs other than that you can pay them less the less skill you demand of them thus the short stick doesnt exist until it is created by the capitalist division of labour nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow to hunt in the morning fish in the afternoon rear cattle in the evening criticise after dinner just as i have a mind without ever becoming hunter fisherman herdsman or critic
socialism,not_removed,but their marriage was a very loving one they remained married until she died i dont see anything wrong with it even if it offends our western age of consentincest sensibilities
socialism,not_removed,i think its an attempt to defame einsteins character because of his personal politics
socialism,not_removed,from google dulce et decorum est pro patria mori is a line from the roman lyrical poet horaces odes the line can be translated as it is sweet and proper to die for ones country
socialism,not_removed,i had that poem in juinor cert english too
socialism,not_removed,youd definitely be hard pressed to find a comparison at any point in history i certainly dont think there is a modern parrallel i have the same but for wwii its unfortunate that such henious time periods are so endlessly fascinating
socialism,not_removed,exactly name one fucking thing that heath insurance provides it literally only creates waste in the system especially now that everything is automatedelectronic
socialism,not_removed,i believe they are saying remove the need for insurance by just making it a standard service
socialism,not_removed,im saying cut out the middle man
socialism,not_removed,i dont know about toothpaste because toothpaste is pretty cut and dry but think about computers my needs might be very different than yours i may want to spend my time developing a new system or a new piece of hardware that can advance technology or provide a unique function and i may not want to hitch it to existing systems right away or ever we value things like windows os and linux distros differently because of the different learning curves and capabilities of the two systems a one size fits all approach works for some things like toothpaste but certainly not everything edit my point is that there are other reasons to diversify than competition and profit
socialism,not_removed,why would we need that tho improving products and meeting peoples needs is not the same as diversifying options for the sake of profit and competition there are people that need different types of toothpaste though gel or paste sensitive or strong flavor options childrens toothpaste nonflouride toothpaste there are many possibilities
socialism,not_removed,everyone i mean everyone already gives in the form of taxes now anyway
socialism,not_removed,everyone according to their abilities
socialism,not_removed,how does the class arm itself as a whole if not through individuals arming themselves
socialism,not_removed,socialists are pretty ambivalent about bernie hes a nordicmodel social democrat socialists want the workers to own the means of production some are friendlier to bernie some hostile
socialism,not_removed,bernies views on gun control aside hes more of a socialist than a lot of people might be aware of he advocated for worker cooperatives in and in he talks about worker alienation the need of people to see themselves in their work and the necessity of worker ownership he was also a member of a socialist party in vermont called the httpsenwikipediaorgwikilibertyunionparty
socialism,not_removed,its funny because as others have said bernie is a social democrat but more so because all the liberals i know say hes too progun for them to support
socialism,not_removed,bernie is a social liberalcapatalist in policy and not a socialist a step in the right direction but still a half measure
socialism,not_removed,bernie is diet socialism not an actual socialist
socialism,not_removed,agreed and there wouldnt even need to be an argument for a mental health requirement if we had proper mental health system and were able to treat everyone and anyone
socialism,not_removed,were all accelerationists now
socialism,not_removed,i dont know if id go that far its got just the right message smug liberals like to use right before they say universal basic income we need to get rid of crony capitalism not all capitalism communism only works on paper or my favorite go on in rosa the waters fine
socialism,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomnncrufipng
socialism,not_removed,its the people who read dawkins who are of concern they use his hatred of religion to segue into racism against people who originate in the middle east predominantly arabs
socialism,not_removed,people thrive in jobs they enjoy not all happiness needs to be measured by advancement and productivity consumers play a valuable role in any society just as creators and innovators
socialism,not_removed,a socialist society i dont think is one that would assign jobs to everyone i imagine a system where higher education is provided but considerably more difficult that way the most skilled and most determined people would get the positions that demand them in america we have a system thats expensive but easy so who gets to be a scientist engineer or doctor is determined a lot by class no coincidence that these are also the highest paying jobs
socialism,not_removed,recognized maybe not but it would certainly lessen the chance that said individuals would be born into conditions where theyre forced to live their lives away in sweatshops where their talent goes unused
socialism,not_removed,you write as if economics is a natural science it is a social science just like history and sociology look how many different factions exist in those fields the same applies to economics just as there are liberal schools there are socialists schools and austrian schools economics is not physics there is no mathematical proof of one school over the other
socialism,not_removed,want people to actually take you seriously study economics disprove the mathematically rigorous theories evolved over years by some of the smartest people in history marx and other socialist have studies the economics of capitalism and disproved the mathematically rigorous theories evolved over years please see das kapital vols iiii by karl marxfriedrich engels and capital in the twentyfirst century by thomas piketty as two examples
socialism,not_removed,aborted fetus was never a living person so it doesnt matter

socialism,not_removed,personfamily yes
socialism,not_removed,better those worthless citizens be out of the workforce and let those who actually want to work do so in my opinion
socialism,not_removed,oh shit there it is thanks rip mods
socialism,not_removed,you mean a country where the majority of businesses land and resources are privately owned no prob ill tell a capitalist country that capitalism is screwing them over
socialism,not_removed,lets say youre correct and we cant reproduce superscientists humanity is still in a better position to have more humans that are or as smart as einstein also need to ask you for a source that we cant compete with genetic advantage you make some heavy claims that im not saying are false but that require citation
socialism,not_removed,the advent of automation will probably drive us to something new out of necessity at some point this is one of the core points of marxist analysis
socialism,not_removed,im doing great working in rd for my first job and i love it i worked retail while i was in school so this a whole new world to me now they pay me to learn stuff and fiddle with things school was very tough on me as i had to work as much as i could handle i also lost my marriage but that was her fault and im way better off because of it essentially i put my life almost on hold for years as i worked towards it looking back i was pretty much in over my head i knew nothing past maybe some algebra but i was determined without the internet i would have never made it theres just so many resources to learn
socialism,not_removed,be ready for some of that while in your career when you have some success oy vey
socialism,not_removed,idk times a day american redditors complain about their massive debt from student loans and how they still work in food service
socialism,not_removed,and ive read low estimate to highest hours a week for work and survival activities in huntergatherer societiestribes these were tribes i imagine that cared for all of their members or perished together were the poorest people in tribal society years ago better off than the poorest people in society today everyone seems to be so sure of the answer to this question
socialism,not_removed,while i agree with your point i cant figure how it adds to this conversation unless you are implying that it is only possible to say that there has been progress when evaluating the evolution of the sociopolitical status of europe your point being that whether a net improvement in the life of the masses in other societies has been brought by global capitalism is debatable it surely is a topic beyond me and most of us but i cant help but feel that it all boils down to an unrealistic idealization of other societies
socialism,not_removed,the medieval period is very long and covers lots of social changes but i can tell you peasants didnt have half the year off they made cloths in their offtime or other small scale activities
socialism,not_removed,thats incredibly wrong they needed to heat their homes so they had to go to the forest chop down trees carry them back home and chop and store them for the coming winter they needed clothes as uikhthus pointed out they had animals to take care of the whole year round they had to hunt at times in case the reserve of food wasnt enough they had to make and repair tools for the summer they had to insulate and repair their own homes they had to serve in the lords manour as servants the women especially peasants definitely did not have half a year off
socialism,not_removed,yeah which they spent trying not to freeze to death die of sickness and of course fix up the lords holdfast
socialism,not_removed,the whole dying of infection after an injury does sound a lil bad once yo remember the good ol times tho
socialism,not_removed,im just kidding but honestly we work harder and are more stressed under capitalism than any generation before eh thats not entirely true definitely not harder as most jobs today are officeclerical jobs where you sit behind a desk all day or transportation jobs where you sit behind a wheel all day not nearly as many people today work as farmers factory machinists construction manufacturing etc jobs that are harder because they require physical and menial labor if you want to say we work longer wellthats not true either since most people typically work about hour days which was brought to us thanks to unions as people would work hour days or longer in the not too distant past
socialism,not_removed,im just kidding but honestly we work harder and are more stressed under capitalism than any generation before really seriously what about the farmers who were taxed by the church the noblemen owning the land the king and whoever else in authority happened to come by hunter gatherers had far more time for social and cultural activities than we did oh i see you just jumped from prehistoric man right to modern capitalism
socialism,not_removed,theroux wrote about the primitive modern work gap a long time ago
socialism,not_removed,we live in an era where there are hundreds of millions of people perpetually starving that couldnt really happen in previous modes of production its actually over a billion right now while at the same time we produce enough food to feed billion people and pretty much the only reason they are starving is simply beacuse they cannot afford that food puts things into perspective when you think about it
socialism,not_removed,you thought that there was historically no mass starvation or famine in africa or asia in levels of agricultural civilization there was no famine or mass starvation wow what a stunning level of ignorance at least try to educate yourself on a topic to some rudimentary level before speaking on it

socialism,not_removed,all of my kids are in public school now with legitimate economical racial and ethnic diversity
socialism,not_removed,for preschool i made the best decision that i could at the time and it wasnt an easy choice to make once my kids were old enough they each started public school
socialism,not_removed,it really depends on the public schools ive spent the last few years working in public schools in oakland california and they are so bad that ive never had a coworker that was comfortable with the idea of their own kids going to the school where we worked donating to schools doesnt always help either because they tend to use the money for the wrong shit i am so glad that i dont have kids and dont have to deal with finding a way to pay for a school where the six year olds dont bring guns to school in order to rob one another at recess
socialism,not_removed,the communist equivalent is fully luxury automated gay space communism
socialism,not_removed,i found it on rcompleteanarchy i think theres one like this for communism on rfullcommunism
socialism,not_removed,i hear what youre saying my concern is that many top experts dont want to be involved in doing such things do we force them into service how do we handle that
socialism,not_removed,sorry to nitpick but farming is highly skilled labor and most places in europe just employ the farmer maybe their husband or wife and a lot of farmers have a second job in either a factory or construction or something
socialism,not_removed,its very common think of every time someone brings up mlks infidelity
socialism,not_removed,it is not unfortunate at all bud i myself have a penchant for wwi our flaws and failures aught to be studied and examined more closely imo
socialism,not_removed,i have the same but for wwii its unfortunate that such henious time periods are so endlessly fascinating probably because of a few things we have a lot of firsthand written sources about the events which occurred on battlefields in governments in individual homes and even in the lives on people who are inconsequential the events of the wars didnt happen in a vacuum we have so damned much recorded history of the events unfolding around the world leading up to these events we know what the public sentiment was the events can be dissected in so many ways from a military perspective from a marxist perspective from a purely political perspective from an economic perspective from the logistical perspective of a clerk at auschwitz signing for individual shipments of zyklonb from bayer and ive already beaten this horse to deathbut theres just so fucking much source material diaries of the turnip winter in germany individual clerical records of all the armies and navies involved reams of diplomatic correspondence from all parties diaries from teenaged dutch jewish girls hiding from nazis in attics while coping with adolescence individual payrolls and manifests from factories in belligerent nations which hired people incapable of soldiering the diaries of citizens of the losing nations as they watched their yearold sons pressed into service for doomed offensives unlike so much other conflict those wars and the events that caused them have so much to read its not the sort of history you read about when discussing alexander the great you have real documentation of the average man woman and childs plight and you get to see through their experiences what a real worldwide war is like at home and on the battlefield
socialism,not_removed,its unfortunate that such henious time periods are so endlessly fascinating hey well its going to be a lot more fascinating and less academically detached here pretty soon
socialism,not_removed,legally mandated waste at that capital has zero interest in the idealized competition and efficiency they claim markets can create when they can just have a monopoly instead
socialism,not_removed,ding ding
socialism,not_removed,so the options for computers are windows linux and mac but wouldnt we have more options in a socialist society rather than having a couple big corporations control the computer industry wed have many smaller communes producing different computers
socialism,not_removed,the problem is not meeting peoples needs i mentioned that as something we should do the problem comes when brands are producing the same product for the same exact need thats just a waste they do it to compete and gain profits that wont exist on a socialist society the drive will be simply the continuos betterment of society so forget about downgrading useless superficial changes falseadvertisement planned obsolescence or illogical choices like making a phone thinner while sacrificing hours and hours of batterylife
socialism,not_removed,thats why i mentioned meeting peoples needs but why would we need brands of sensitive toothpaste for example we would simply produce the best one and try to improve it
socialism,not_removed,by raiding state armories or stealing them from other places however that would fall under the frustrated by force if necessary though not all encompassing but arming preemptively under a capitalist umbrella would require private arming imo
socialism,not_removed,ill give the guy a break and say given his history i have no problem believing that his personal views might be socialist but the views he ran his campaign on certainly were not
socialism,not_removed,choochoo
socialism,not_removed,years ago none of them would even be saying that i roll my eyes when i see that shit too but it does signify a general change in attitude about these topics just keep pushing it
socialism,not_removed,i guess but isnt that kindof like blaming charles darwin for nazism people arent responsible for whatever corruptions of their ideas that others concoct
socialism,not_removed,also the modern field of economics was kinda pioneered by that marx guy
socialism,not_removed,source
socialism,not_removed,a happy slave is still a slave
socialism,not_removed,those are things they did on their own time though like im not saying it was easy sailing but peasants that served in a lords manor werent the majority blacksmiths did the majority of the tool making not the peasants themselves in exchange for making tools they were fed and paid making clothes cutting wood hunting during food shortages and home maintenance are not all daily tasks taking care of animals is just about the only one that would be every day yes there is a lot of hard work involved and not everything is rosy and amazing im not saying thats the case by any means but over all there is still a good chunk of free time
socialism,not_removed,as a percent of global population the poor in were double the poor in that would be those who are below un poverty level of at least dollars of food per day per person and a few other metrics
socialism,not_removed,the problem is still that the poor arent treated nearly as good as they should be and our politicians keep trying to make it worse rather than improve it even though its statistically proven that treating the poor better results in significantly less crime and may even increase productivity secure welfare at the very least forces companies to pay an acceptable wage or they risk having no workers since people cant be forced to work out of desperation anymore
socialism,not_removed,if people actually died with an infection how do you think anyone lived past age twelve the reality is that many of the greatest killers among diseases are essentially modern creationsfor example strains of the cholera bacteria have existed for a very long time but the first cholera epidemics were in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century
socialism,not_removed,idk where youve been but a lot of people still work those jobs
socialism,not_removed,where are these only hour a day jobs i must be doing something wrong
socialism,not_removed,sitting all day is terrible on the body though saying drivers and office personnel have it easy isnt fair were all in this together all workers
socialism,not_removed,tow truck driver here still work days days a week
socialism,not_removed,medieval peasants worked less hours than we do on average today not saying that id like to go back and live then but they had a better worklife balance than we do now
socialism,not_removed,youre right i should have said work longer
socialism,not_removed,european farmers worked far less hours than the modern worker does subsistence farming simply did not require that much labor to sustain and even then it was only part of the year
socialism,not_removed,really seriously what about the farmers who were taxed by the church the noblemen owning the land the king and whoever else in authority happened to come by so i take it you dont live in a city state or country dont have a landlord or a mortgage payment you dont have a telecom bill you own your own source of food and water you dont pay a tax every time you purchase something are you not taxed by your boss every hour you labor if not im happy for you but very few of us have the privilege of being as free as you seem to be
socialism,not_removed,really seriously what about the farmers who were taxed by the church the noblemen owning the land the king and whoever else in authority happened to come by now theyre in thirdworld countries mining stuff for the first world to sort of work
socialism,not_removed,we produce more than ever due to machines but the market forces us to work longer and longer undoing progress that was already made by the labour struggle in the past
socialism,not_removed,this is completely untrue and completely and utterly contradicted by every study on hunter gatherers modern and previous the idea that hunter gatherers didnt have social and cultural traditions is also absurd as well as being extremely demeaning to the real actual people who live different lives than yours why bother making claims on a topic you have done no research on
socialism,not_removed,there are hunter gatherers today that prove this statement is utter bullshit

socialism,not_removed,ill refine my statement there was no mass perpetual starvation and malnutrition caused by lack of food as there is currently in africa and asia with extreme weather and war came famine but besides that there were no regions that were consistently unable to support their population to the point where there was always a group of people starving there instead only as many people lived in an area as could subsist
socialism,not_removed,preagricultural civilization
socialism,not_removed,there are no sources because suicide wasnt seen as a sociological problem before durkheims work suicide
socialism,not_removed,the contrast between capitalist and precapitalist work patterns is most striking in respect to the working year the medieval calendar was filled with holidays official that is church holidays included not only long vacations at christmas easter and midsummer but also numerous saints andrest days these were spent both in sober churchgoing and in feasting drinking and merrymaking in addition to official celebrations there were often weeks worth of ales to mark important life events bride ales or wake ales as well as less momentous occasions scot ale lamb ale and hock ale all told holiday leisure time in medieval england took up probably about onethird of the year httpgroupscsailmitedumacusersrauchworktimehoursworkweekhtml i dont know if we can directly answer whether or not suicide was worse then or now but it does at least appear that precapitalist europeans probably suffered less social alienation than today a big factor in depression
socialism,not_removed,or promise of eternal hellfire for suicides
socialism,not_removed,i dont think that is the point the uwalkinghard is making
socialism,not_removed,the automated goes before the luxury
socialism,not_removed,pics or it didnt happen
socialism,not_removed,im rather confusedyou consider scientists and engineers to not be contributing to society or not as much as politicians why im also confused by why you think people who are naturally inclined towards science or engineering would be equally or more inclined towards say legislative drafting even though they have no interest in that field
socialism,not_removed,never heard of it
socialism,not_removed,thats an excellent point my friend we have to learn everything we can from them and avoid them in the future
socialism,not_removed,those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it
socialism,not_removed,i agree wholeheartedly and thats why i specified in policy hell i even voated for him
socialism,not_removed,i agree its not explicitly dawkins fault these types of people look through every piece of media they can for things that will validate their worldview theyll blatantly contradict source material to validate their racist worldview ive seen them take genuinely admirable people and twist their words to the point that they can justify their bigotry its all ammunition to them that said dawkins could do a lot more to alienate those people and control his fans he could also stop getting involved in any and all current events because every time he pipes up he sounds like your typical racist uncle at thanksgiving
socialism,not_removed,the labor theory of value has been disproved how are goods now being magically conjured out of thin air without any form of labor being put into them the very premise of your comment is mind boggling to conceive of in the real world everything is produced by human labor everything there is not a single purchasable product on earth that did not come about as a result of human labor the necessity to pay for that labor in the form of wages causes the price of goods to be tacked in large part to the wage effort required to produce it i was not even aware this concept was under debate much less to speak of it being fundamentally flawed can you explain further what you mean by this edit you know what ill go a step further you mention marxian concepts have been empirically disproven which in of itself makes no sense at all economics is not a hard science you cannot empirically prove anything in economics because there is no way whatsoever to control the variables in a human economy you come off as intelligent at first because you use high level vocabulary but anyone with even a reasonable grasp of the concepts you are discussing will find very serious errors in your logic almost instantly
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,libertarian heartthrob adam smith also espoused labor theory of value so well have to toss that shit out too
socialism,not_removed,for appearing supposedly informed your argumentative technique is awfully inadequate disregarding your numerous logical fallacies exactly how has marxs theories been disproven
socialism,not_removed,no problem ill delete my response lol
socialism,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikieconomyofvenezuela
socialism,not_removed,but im questioning the premise here that poor people today are happier than poor people years ago likely there were other forms of hierarchy but in preagricultural society there was no land ownership it was preslavery a nonslave is happier than a happy slave i would imagine
socialism,not_removed,no it isnt dont believe every graph you see on the front page of dataisbeautiful
socialism,not_removed,no no we are better off so we should not try to do better still s
socialism,not_removed,ftfy first recorded cholera epidemics plus cholera wasnt always diagnosed as such
socialism,not_removed,how do you think anyone lived past age twelve honestly it was mostly that we had much higher birth rates to overcome the demographic risks in of children worldwide died before their fifth birthday in still did we have now reduced this to the chance of your children dying before kindergarten age literally used to be higher i mean hell marx himself had of his children die as infants the reality is that many of the greatest killers among diseases are essentially modern creationsfor example strains of the cholera bacteria have existed for a very long time but the first cholera epidemics were in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century again not really true epidemics are a result of populationdensity which has increased yes but cholera is hardly the greatest killer among diseases the greatest killers among diseases are pneumonia diarrhea and simple skin infections in cuts
socialism,not_removed,some do yes but the vast majority of jobs in the us and europe are transportation clericaloffice retail and hospitality hence why i said not nearly as many
socialism,not_removed,im not saying they have it easy or people dont work hard i just took issue with the claim that people today work harder than people of previous generations this is simply not true at all we work less hours in jobs that are not nearly as dangerous or taxing on our bodies as previous generations did
socialism,not_removed,you dont really have to sit all day my dad started using a standing desk after he got back problem and hes been advising it ever since
socialism,not_removed,yea no ive worked both office jobs and construction and office jobs are much easier you usually dont come home from the office and instantly pass out for hours you also typically dont have to wake up at or earlier you also dont have your skin cracking and breaking from working in negative temperatures with wind chill or suffer from heat stroke
socialism,not_removed,that depended on how much unpaid extra work you were suddenly required to do because your boss thought his castle really wasnt fortified enough
socialism,not_removed,that was not the point youre either being intellectually dishonest or you didnt read my post and the preceding one correctly
socialism,not_removed,well refined or not youre still very badly wrong there is no shortage of food in the world right now and there hasnt been in a very long time there are governments and societies that are so utterly corrupt that they cannot get existing food and resources to the people who need it in fact if you take a look at the history of famines going back as far as we have documentation you find that mass starvation and famine are never caused by an actual lack of food they are caused by wealthy and powerful people in a culture getting afraid of a lack of food and hoarding it all to themselves there is absolutely no support for the idea that people starve simply because there are too many of them in some given location
socialism,not_removed,its hard to be socially alienated when the technology doesnt exist to make it possible without computers and the internet how many people would be socially alienated today sure theres always been a handful of hermits who live in sod huts in the forest theyre not statistically significant
socialism,not_removed,and the use of the church to keep the peasants in check
socialism,not_removed,what in the fuck are you talking about the church is a shit institution full of shit practices who have for centuries oppressed the lowest classes of society i never said most leaders are evil thats some shit you pulled out of thin air the church has been a tool of the ruling classes to make the people accept their lot i dont doubt theres lots of clergymen that do good but the institution is rotten and so is the religion
socialism,not_removed,that is not a reliable source and referencing many studies is just weasel words furthermore the very concept of iq being used like that is lambasted by the inventor of iq tests

socialism,not_removed,who knows what could have occurred in the illiterate society of india
socialism,not_removed,yeah but the aim isnt socialism in one country and there are still horrific mines and sweatshops etc
socialism,not_removed,the job across the world developed or developing is either farming or manufacturing and transporting those goods
socialism,not_removed,idk i still spend typically hour days throwing heavy cases because those are the only types of jobs that pay decent in the area i live in all my friends work manual labor as well weve decided wed have to move if we wanted a desk job but honestly i dont think i could sit all day anymore i dont mind the work really but its frustrating that all the factories and warehouses around here require you to work ridiculous hours and usually weeks at a time because they have quotas to make
socialism,not_removed,not nearly as dangerous or taxing yeah theyre just soul crushingly boring and meaningless is all
socialism,not_removed,seriously serfdom was basically one step above slavery and you had very few legal rightsthe whole reason for things like the magna carta wage slavery isnt great but everyone that has access to be typing these comments on reddit right now has it better than most of the rest of human civilization
socialism,not_removed,im not disagreeing with the rights bit but that wasnt real likely though compared to the age before it and the age after it the medieval age was pretty peaceful just because all the logistics to raise massive armies kinda disappeared after rome fell so you wouldnt have a lot of rights but the vast majority of the time you would have about half of the year off
socialism,not_removed,instead of simply declaring i am intellectually dishonest why dont you show me where as for labor time it is generally borne out by research that httpgroupscsailmitedumacusersrauchworktimehoursworkweekhtmlhours although these things are rather difficult to measure as the definition of labor is fuzzy
socialism,not_removed,starvation cannot happen if the food is present and accessible for people simple as that i dont mean that the food doesnt exist its just not in the hands of people who need it so i suppose if you dont want to call that a shortage fine my point still stands
socialism,not_removed,yeah so much oppression feeding and housing the poor so evil mwa ha ha ha
socialism,not_removed,then refute the article you cant just say they are untrustworthy and take it at face value that the data is wrong i wouldnt trust the world bank to publish data that didnt reinforce their standing either
socialism,not_removed,yes manual labor jobs still exist the difference is they are far less common then they once were for previous generations used to be in the early history of the us the majority of people were farmers then the industrial revolution happened and the jobs shifted to factories do farmers and factory workers still exist today of course but the majority of jobs are in other sectors also if you spend hours a day working either you are limited to hours a week or are making some serious overtime money as you stated those are the only types of jobs that pay well which is another difference from previous generations they never had those overtime protections and pay that you describe
socialism,not_removed,it isnt a different world the exploitation of workers in the developing world effectively subsidizes the comforts of the developed world
socialism,not_removed,ill take boring and meaningless over dangerous any day
socialism,not_removed,the magna carta was a document to secure the rights of the nobility against the king not the rights of the serfs
socialism,not_removed,you had very few legal rights i would even argue you had essentially none
socialism,not_removed,oh theres not doubt that socially things were much worse i was commenting solely on the labor side of things
socialism,not_removed,so we should just give up on progress
socialism,not_removed,also pedophilia homophobia misogyny exploitation of workers exploiting children as labourers residential schools putting bs biblical passages before individual health etc edit forgot a few
socialism,not_removed,that is an appeal to authority heres a thought socioeconomics can influence intelligence feel free to show me a biology journal with evidence of an intelligence gene im going to wager it is a complex interaction between inheritance socioeconomics epigentics and the luck of having all your chromosomes
socialism,not_removed,yeah thats true the pay is definitely whats attracting lots of us to the jobs now theres a surprising amount of people i work with who have degrees im talking about frito lay for my current job ill be working hours through new years but ill also be sitting at for holiday pay i think a lot of us would go elsewhere without that pay so i can see where youre coming from we definitely all have the choice to do something else if we really wanted to just hard to find a desk job thatd pay that well edit to add this in that being said with the pay the downside is almost all of us would trade some of that to get more time off thats the thing that sucks theres no good in between with those jobs id love to work hours but the only way to keep my job is to work tons of forced overtime and days sure they pay me for it but it definitely sucks up most my free time and has an undeniable affect on relationships
socialism,not_removed,yeah because they didnt need the overtime back then are you foreal saying that dude busting his ass working hours a week is a luxury cuz he gets overtime pay lol
socialism,not_removed,also if you spend hours a day working either you are limited to hours a week or are making some serious overtime money or hes salaried
socialism,not_removed,its a sort of trickledown of rights perhaps edit for clarity what i mean is that someone besides the king first had to stand up for their rights and it kicked off the idea that there were civil liberties that must be respected and was a landmark for rule of law
socialism,not_removed,the russian revolution written in by rosa luxemburg is a great critic and analysis of the russian revolution from an socialist perspective she does both praise and criticsometimes pretty hard the policys of lenin and co but also accounts for the difficulties the revolution faced at that point in time so whatever your think of lenin co and the revolution it is an very interesting work that should be read by any socialist interested in the russian revolution
socialism,not_removed,dear nick capitalist the problem isnt that capitalism isnt working the problem is capitalism is working perfectly i propose plutocrats like yourself shouldnt exist and that instead of raising the minimum wage to an hour we let workers be adult humans and decide their wage themselves so eat your pheasant drink your wine your days are numbered bourgeois swine

socialism,not_removed,could somebody explain what this has to do with socialism or capitalism for that matter the china has httpsenmwikipediaorgwikihomelessnessinchina north korea has many homeless httpsenmwikipediaorgwikikotjebi the httpsenmwikipediaorgwikilistofcountriesbyhomelesspopulation include israel japan hong kong south korea portugal and switzerland all of these are capitalist scandinavian countries with heavily mixed economies do well but not as good and communist countries are pretty much in the mix with most others there doesnt tend to be a correlation with degree of socialism or capitalism other than capitalist societies generally topping the list of lowest homeless rates so i dont get how the link fits the title or subreddit

socialism,not_removed,haha ha
socialism,not_removed,fuck this is brilliant
socialism,not_removed,comes down to wealth distrinution
socialism,not_removed,so im ignoring homelessness when i pay money to support homeless shelters and i dont also then hand out money to homeless on the streets on an individual level
socialism,not_removed,is that john green
socialism,not_removed,yeah all the charities in america have nothing to do with capitalism
socialism,not_removed,if everyone is equally poor then we will all be visible problem solved fuck your dreams capitalists
socialism,not_removed,some people would pay money to be homeless this comic is unrighteous
socialism,not_removed,according to the new york times the right give to charity the rates of the left i wish the altruism and compassion for your fellow man was actually true but you guys are cheap as fuck cant wait to hear all the excuses for why the left who apparently has a monopoly on compassion gives fuck all to charity in comparison to the unfeeling greed we experience on the right
socialism,not_removed,thanks i was looking for the red button
socialism,not_removed,thank you for actually citing it drives me nuts when people dont especially for smbc
socialism,not_removed,i love this one

socialism,not_removed,basically hes an sep somebody elses problem no one can see it because they dont want to

socialism,not_removed,stay awhile my friend have a discussion
socialism,not_removed,that website does not seem reputable
socialism,not_removed,in the us there are more vacant houses than homeless people we also know that having less homeless people means spending less in general socialists are very critic of the concept of private property the thing that is preventing those houses from being occupied by people who actually need a shelter its true that some homeless people are mentally ill either secondarily to being homeless or primitively so they might not agree to live in a house thats an issue on the short span for sure but in the long term you will have less people dying in the streets expecially if you couple expropriation with better healthcare
socialism,not_removed,if virtually every country is capitalist of course capitalists with be at the top of every list theyll probably be at the bottom as well also talking about issues in the soviet union and and fucking north korea and acting like those issues will apply everywhere shows a lack of understanding of both socialism and those countries
socialism,not_removed,im sorry but do people here really consider countries with governments as warped as nks as properly socialist in the sense of what you guys are fighting for and the ussr was highly imperfect often unstable poor and this was often acknowledged towards the end this seems like a troll comment meant to confuse problems in societies that are nominally socialist than actual discussion of how socialist thinking can help everyone
socialism,not_removed,calling the su china and nk socialist is likely to lose people
socialism,not_removed,as socialists we care about socioeconomic issues such as homelessness this was posted to address the issue of homelessness and point out how theyre often ignored or mistreated most of us here agree that capitalism drives the presence of homelessness and that the default ideologies that capitalism instills are what cause such widespread disregard of the homeless i could explain it but id have to explain a fair bit of marxism and a concept called cultural hegemony and tbh i dont really want to
socialism,not_removed,i sadly see it all the time homeless many mentally ill just ignored by the rest of society
socialism,not_removed,rawr xd
socialism,not_removed,why
socialism,not_removed,i understand the idea of socialism i dont think you do if you think the eu is socialist socialism is workers controlling the means of production this does not happen in the eu the eu is nothing but a capitalist and neoliberal institution difficulties in preserving peace in their nation the eu is not a nation either
socialism,not_removed,why is this here in rsocialism eu is not even remotely socialist also semisocialist is not a thing did you make it up socialism doesnt cause massive destruction to human life what you learned is western brainwashing you can be persuaded to socialism by learning about socialism reading books is a good way the us is not only perfect but also horribly bad please go to
socialism,not_removed,the comic is about sociology
socialism,not_removed,from what youre talking about with the eu being semisocialist and all that it sounds like youre conflating socialism with state control or statecapitalism as some of us refer to it which is an understandable mistake if youre new to socialism socialism requires workers control of the means of production which is antithetical to state power as the state functions to maintain the order of class society as such many of us are under the impression that a true socialist society has either never existed or at least only existed to a small degree though youll find a handful of people defending stalin or hoxha or something most of us do not in any way condone the atrocities commited at their hands because frankly their actions had nothing to do with socialism as a concept deceloped by marx engels lenin and so on that is very simplied of course and i would definitely recommend checking out some of the subs reading list for some further explanation but i hope that clears up a bit for you at least
socialism,not_removed,i dont know why youre getting downvoted there are quite a few homeless people with serious problems and i think society should care for them and work towards but i think a big part of the reason people tend not to care about them is anecdotal evidence to how bad they are
socialism,not_removed,donating to their own churches is not charity
socialism,not_removed,donating wealth that youve obtained by refusing the working class the right to participate in the economy is not charity its just an apology for previous sins in a socialist economy that money would already belong to those who need it there would be no need for kind billionaires
socialism,not_removed,i find you liberals to be quite pointless and arrogant too
socialism,not_removed,oh no hes a veteran we gonna have to give him some change this is a quote not my words
socialism,not_removed,this isnt about you
socialism,not_removed,yes yes you are because this image was obviously made with you in mind specifically you the artist was looking at a picture of you for inspiration as they drew this there is no other explanation
socialism,not_removed,well then the free market has determined that they add more value to society than most workers clearly your time would be better spent begging
socialism,not_removed,the fact any addict has to beg on the street to support themselves should indicate to you there is something seriously incredibly wrong with society
socialism,not_removed,thats obviously not what the joke is about social sciences are often portrayed as inferior and being of less utility when compared to natural sciences i would say that people who take such a view of science are also often very atheistic and see natural science as an emancipatory project thatll free people from the shackles of superstition and religion so this joke attacks those assumptions by pointing out the futility of having cloaking technology in the face of social injusticesneglect also pointing out that the social sciences actually can teach us something about how to better society here it echoes a common marxist critique of technology contrary to popular belief technology often does not inherently free human beings the holocaust was made possible through technological advancements and is in a sense exemplary of a capitalist way of organizing societies it is explicitly violent and dehumanizing while capitalist societies are generally dehumanizing and violent in a more subtle way dont jokes get better when you have to explain them
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,this comic isnt antiscience
socialism,not_removed,thats like saying yeah all these stitches have nothing to do with my head injury youre giving credit for the treatment to the ailment
socialism,not_removed,i think the argument there is that charities simply plug up holes in a failing system ultimately charities would be unnecessary if the system just actually worked for everyone
socialism,not_removed,socialism doesnt work like that
socialism,not_removed,user is banned but im leaving their comment up so everyone can enjoy dunking on this liberal fuck
socialism,not_removed,this is according to nicholas kristof not according to the new york times opinion pieces are not generally attributable to the newspaper they appear in and arent really vetted as being factual the claim comes from a book written by a rightwing thinker with no clear or unbiased methodology the claim references liberals not anyone actually on the left the claim itself only says more not charity is often an excuse for leaving in place enormous societal and systemic problems exploiters who have more wealth and can survive while giving a larger portion of their income away would be expected to give more to charity where charity is somehow a necessary system giving to charity as a way to build an image in ones mind that one is not really part of the problem but is fixing it when one is reenforcing the structures which create and enforce poverty to begin with is not virtue basically yeah thats complete bullshit
socialism,not_removed,agreed it doesnt help that the smbc comics dont all have a watermark or website tag on them idk why i see them all the time shared on pages and things and i have to comment
socialism,not_removed,why is that
socialism,not_removed,i take it youve never been to new york if you spent your time here helping every homeless person you saw youd literally do nothing else
socialism,not_removed,thats what makes it funny humor makes tragedy in society palatable
socialism,not_removed,i agree i always felt a little iffy about louis cks cynical humor and the things he chooses to throw cynicism at if anything hes doing more to justify apathy than shine light on the conditions that make people fall to homelessness there was no moral punchline it was just laughing at the differences between us and them the ones who shower every day and the ones who smell like piss hes making people sit back and laugh trivialize poverty make people feel a little more at ease for not caring fuck that sketch not sure how it got so many upvotes on this sub
socialism,not_removed,is this a douglas adams reference
socialism,not_removed,lmao youre in the wrong place and honestly the wrong time
socialism,not_removed,where do you think we are
socialism,not_removed,i see nobody really explained much to you so ill have a go when most people think of communism they think of the soviet union eastern bloc that kind of stuff socialists themselves have a different definition the original defenition communism for us is a stateless classless moneyless society while anarchism is the abolition of hierarchy no bosses in the workplace no political peking order so yes anarchism and communism are absolutely compatible
socialism,not_removed,what other sorts of things do you laugh at people for
socialism,not_removed,lol what do you really not understand if youre sincere i could explain
socialism,not_removed,and thus we begin todays game of sadness or zizek

socialism,not_removed,i like the diego rivera mural in the banner there in fact i think its my favorite one man controller of the universe every time i look at it ive always tried to imagine seeing it animated that mural is both the sum of what we are and what we aspire to as for my politics im not fond of boxes ive considered myself a thirdway democrat while being called redpilled while having my slant favorably compared to milton freeman technocrat suits me fine but im unlikely to ever be in the position to earn this title lately ive begun to internally adopt the rick sanchez mantra when it comes to politics things feel kind of hopeless these days and id rather focus on other things
socialism,not_removed,csmonitor is a very legit news source
socialism,not_removed,the christian science monitor is surprisingly a pretty solid newspaper its in the mainstream of us journalism in the same vein as the washington post and new york times or something like the guardian out of the uk
socialism,not_removed,csmonitor is very trustworthy
socialism,not_removed,well technically private property in our sense means anything used to make money like factories toll roads restraunts where as personal property houses cars your tooth brush gets brought up alot arnt in that category but a program would mostly likely be set up to allow homeless individuals to have those homes
socialism,not_removed,plus you can make the argument that they are state capitalists not socialists
socialism,not_removed,almost no one on this sub considers north korea socialist they are closer to fascist imo clearly hierarchical government virtual monarchy no worker control juche is a perversion of marxism

socialism,not_removed,rsocialism seems to be removing comments arguing with the premise ban happy may not yet apply edit liberal banned
socialism,not_removed,i know the the eu is semi socialist critical thinking and logic skills seriously do you have any idea what this sub is about
socialism,not_removed,the eu is not socialist its a capitalist shared market system this comic is alsonot socialist its about sociology you cant even get the topic of discussion right and bad premises lead to bad logic

socialism,not_removed,are they supposed to donate to your church instead are you about to tell me where people are allowed to donate
socialism,not_removed,churches actually do very good work in helping the needy and providing assistance to the down trodden matter fact churches and religious organizations do a lot of good for the poor maybe you didnt know that but know you do or maybe you just wanted to be edgy either way a misguided comment
socialism,not_removed,since the comment i was going to reply to was erased ill just respond to it from here so that the guy i was going to explain to might be able to see it i understand why the comment was erased otherwise farright trolls would flood the comments with spam but i really wanted to respond to this guy you realize these billionaires you so despise give opportunity to those who wish to participate in the economy through jobs right thats not what economic participation means im talking about the democratic ownership of the means of production if you work within an organization you have a natural right to vote for its board of directors in the exact same way that if you are a citizen of a country you have a natural right to vote for the members of parliamentcongress capitalism refuses people that right and unnaturally centralizes wealth to a small elite if youre implying all wealth amassed by the rich is ill gotten you better have evidence to that claim with such a hefty accusation you need hefty evidence see above its not about what specific method they used to amass their wealth its about the framework in which they are able to amass wealth your idea of socialism sounds all nice in your mind but in reallocation of wealth you literally rob people of wealth theyve amassed in essence robbing them what you describe is not socialism its redistribution of wealth which is actually just a bugfix for capitalism the number one tenant to a free society is consent no the number one tenant of a free society is consensus if you commit a crime you obviously dont consent to being put in prison but the consensus of the citizens is that you should be behind bars id much rather people consent to donate their wealth as many rich people do then to forcefully take their wealth and reallocate as you see fit once again not socialism besides its been tried before and historically proven to fail incorrect youre probably thinking of the ussr which was a statecapitalist society loosely based on communism actual examples of socialism like for instance unions and coops have been proven to be very successful and beneficial to society

socialism,not_removed,hes crude in it and cynical but he clearly thinks its a fucked up situation theres a point when hes describing the terrible circumstances of the homeless person and the crowd hushes a little he chided them a little for laughing even and says a sarcastic little go america thing in the middle
socialism,not_removed,yes
socialism,not_removed,lolol
socialism,not_removed,what advancements have socialist countries made that capitalist countries didnt make first
socialism,not_removed,no political peking order actually its beijing now
socialism,not_removed,you cant just ignore history when youre defining either of those concepts
socialism,not_removed,lol you dont know much about political theory at all do you
socialism,not_removed,honest question why are you here are you just here to preach about how capitalism is so much better and communism killed bajillion people in days also youre aware that people like mussolini and hitler were certainly not following a socialistbased ideology right
socialism,not_removed,no problem to each their own
socialism,not_removed,houses left empty second houses houses bought and kept by banks are private property because they are used to extract profits with rents etc of course your first house is personal property thus truly yours
socialism,not_removed,anarchist catalonia rojava the ukrainian free territory the paris commune
socialism,not_removed,what gives you the right to not even remotely understand what socialism means what i meant was that in a socialist economy the people who do the work own the company and thus also gain its profits its not other peoples money
socialism,not_removed,but in reallocation of wealth you literally rob people of wealth right this is the primary problem of capitalism when the capitalist earns value from the work of others that is theft
socialism,not_removed,ok then the fact that our society has spawned such a selfdestructive epidemic of opiate addiction should indicate to you there is something seriously incredibly wrong with society we can play this game all day if you want you can go ahead and blame the individual but its no secret that individualist societies like our western capitalist states have much greater problems with substance abuse than collectivist societies where everyone shares responsibility for taking care of each other
socialism,not_removed,i mean no body is poor in a true socialist society
socialism,not_removed,its only fake news when it says bad things about trump
socialism,not_removed,but its free its not about money but about credit to the artist edit a lot of confused people below please dont comment if you dont understand words intellectual property is theft here it is roughly explained
socialism,not_removed,definitely it just helps trace the comic back more easily the amount of times weve all seen stolen or misattributed comics or works is probably uncountable watermarks help but if youre intending to steal they wont dissuade you much httpswwwfacebookcomrandowis is a good example as the artist frequently calls out other pages who are likefarming with his work
socialism,not_removed,of course its just that trying to help each and every one as an individual is the sort of thing that leads you towards many cynical nights at the bar trying to drink away the futility of life any real effective attempt at helping the homeless has to be a collaborative effort
socialism,not_removed,wow how low reddit downvotes
socialism,not_removed,working in a big inner city area you just fucking cant help them all so many of them are homeless because they cant stop doing drugs and getting drunk so then none of the homeless centers will take them because they never clean up their act
socialism,not_removed,quick just glance around not trying to look at it if may see it out of the corner of your eye
socialism,not_removed,if i did i certainly wouldnt have posted in a sub literally about socialism which i can respect but communismanarchism youre aware that socialism is a major component of these ideologies right socialism is just an economic system that is used in most leftwing ideologies that are actually left not centrist
socialism,not_removed,nothing will change if you dont try also pretty bold claiming it wont work when you know nothing about anarchocommunism it has already worked many times
socialism,not_removed,yeah thats kind of the point haha used to be a pretty common thing on certain chan subboards back in or so then chan culture went from ironic racism to fullblown racism what a shock amirite
socialism,not_removed,no rebuttle seems about right
socialism,not_removed,if someone asked for an example of democracy would you point them to the usa our presidents are chosen through arcane means that allow a person with fewer votes to win our elections are rigged by party establishments our politicians are bought by the rich through bribes called donations that is not how democracy is supposed to work the usa is not a good example of democracy even though americans would describe themselves as democratic but this is what youre doing to socialism youre ignoring the desires of the people who like the ideology and attempting to tie them to poor implementations of it in history if democracy only meant democracy the way the usa practices it id fucking hate democracy if socialism only meant socialism the way the ussr practiced it id fucking hate socialism too luckily though theres more to both ideologies than the failures of history
socialism,not_removed,this is the mostly widely accepted definition of communism backed up by marx im not ignoring history
socialism,not_removed,here is the history of the various anarchist regimes explained in minutes perhaps a bit of history that you are ignoring
socialism,not_removed,would you apply that to the palaces of the bourgeoisie because i think to slap the label personal property on a complex of high quality housing that could support a dozen families or more would be rather ridiculous
socialism,not_removed,fair enough
socialism,not_removed,so the thought of getting shot for precious little is inspiring now im all for pragmatism but lets be honest the back record of libertarian socialism is not inspiring
socialism,not_removed,people who work are entitled to a voluntary exchange that they agreed to thats it you want to work for me ok i will pay you you dont get to own the company unless we both agree to that works both ways i dont get to steal your company either
socialism,not_removed,but its not free while theres no direct monetary cost the real site has adverts and a link to a merchandise store both of which accumulate a measurable amount of income per visits or whatever edit i have no idea how but somehow at least one person thinks im bashing the comic creator im bashing the people draining from the creators income by not linking directly to the site they monetise their hard work on
socialism,not_removed,meh yes and no i see what youre saying here theres a danger that the communist rhetoric against intellectual property is just helping capitalists exploit artists but on the other hand either you believe in privateintellectual property or you dont if someone shoplifts food for themselves and justifies it using communist rhetoric they should also have no qualms with pirating or sharing media and if they do then it seems the principal guiding the actions in both cases isnt a lack of belief in private property but rather some judgement about who they are taking stuff from
socialism,not_removed,a lot of them dont want to be helped yeah im sure they all started out that way s
socialism,not_removed,a lot of them have mental health issues at least that is the case in philly and i can only imagine that already underfunded shelters cannot cope with those kinds of issues to fix homelessness they need homes not shelters i like they idea of creating communities of tiny homes for them with communal areas for cooking and gardening and a social worker on site to assist with problems and help them with the minutiae of getting their lives on track and getting jobs
socialism,not_removed,if anything improving our mental health services is the way to go about helping reduce homelessness but i swear thats a hard cause tooshootings just end up as gun debates instead
socialism,not_removed,a lot of people and organizations do not help unconditionally or help only certain groups such as women and children shelters are not always safe theres a reason a lot of homeless people avoid them
socialism,not_removed,girlfriend is a social worker in supportive housing here in nyc that tries to get them stable income a lot do have a really hard time adjusting to work and have been in her program for years i wouldnt say a lot dont want to be help or else they wouldnt have sought out the assistance in the first place but its a much deeper problem than just they dont want to be helped psychology and seeded drug addiction are the largest hurdles its kind of a miracle and a rarity when her clients really work to turn their lives around we need more resources to attack those issues that cause the systemic problem of homelessness in the first place more support for affordable and available mental health while changing the social stigma that comes with it the war on drugs is failing and i feel like more mental health support from society can alleviate the abuse of drugs that are used when people are suffering trauma
socialism,not_removed,there is a lot of mental illness and general distrust in the homeless population but the way i see it things will never get better unless some serious effort goes into correcting the issue this is kinda a controversial grey area but even if one doesnt want help it may be necessary to force it upon them
socialism,not_removed,dont forget that mental illness plays a major role in homelessness unmet psychiatric health needs often lead to selfmedicating with drugs and alcohol its a situation that leads many people to homelessness and then helps trap them there remember that americas largest mental health provider is the prison system which is simply incapable of providing the sort of comprehensive longterm care required to address chronic mental illness
socialism,not_removed,so many of them are homeless because they cant stop doing drugs and getting drunk so youre saying we shouldnt give them a place to stay because they need medical help
socialism,not_removed,did they invent anything besides military inventions
socialism,not_removed,its loose respect plus communism and socialism are different people often debate on whether or not they agree with lenins socialisms goal is communism quote as well so idk if its a major component of communism or a much more right wing version of it
socialism,not_removed,how has it worked many times anarchy is the chaos that society rose out of theres definitely a difference between socialism and communism otherwise thered be no need to have words to differentiate
socialism,not_removed,i what i love democracy but absolutely my first choice if someone were to ask for an example of democracy would be the usa either that or my home canada the usa is the largest and most successful democracy the world has ever known it is absolutely the most well known and most influential democracy you dont get to pick and choose examples to fit your narrative the ussr might not have been true communism or true socialism but people with those things as their ideals as their goals created it the usa might not be the most functional democracy but it is surely democracys symbol around the world
socialism,not_removed,you need rtrees for that
socialism,not_removed,thanks for showing interest it is much better to see people question in good faith rather than just smug replies like we usually get so i want to thank you for that history is not in your favour here but i may be ignorant of the facts in fact it is for the vast majority of human history we lived in protocommunist societies where resources where shared communally and class conflict and other sorts of social antagonisms like racism sexism homophobia transphobia were fairly negligible factors in society to be fair though these societies were very primitive and did not have the productive forces economy industry infrastructure to sustain protocommunism and thus different forms of economy developed to increase these forces each successive leap we have taken in economic systems has always sublated the inherent contradictions of the previous one feudalisms contradiction was that private accumulation could not occur in an economy largely based on the size of your realm especially once the economy became much more industrial this is a very simplified way of looking at it the contradiction of capitalism is labour and capital the socialization of production but the privatization of wealth socialism seeks to sublate that contradiction by socializing production and wealth and also the contradiction of class conflict which intersects with racism sexism homophobia transphobia etc whats even more interesting is that peter kropotkin the most prominent anarchocommunist demonstrated that humans in a natural environment were cooperative beings that naturally acted socialistically where resources production and societal duties were shared and distributed democratically are there any strong examples of a functional communist society in the world outside of native tribes in the amazon rainforest first a correction communism the historical stage has never been achieved communism the final historical stage is not the same as protocommunism so you must be referring to socialism secondly this answer is highly dependent on what sort of socialist you are asking a marxistleninist and marxistleninistmaoist are going to point you towards the ussr and the prc though those are only examples they might use an anarchist or libertarian socialist not to be confused with an anarchocapitalist or libertarian capitalist they are very different would point towards the ukraine free territory revolutionary catalonia chiapas and rojava today a left communist would maintain that socialism has never existed going back to your example were the allies supposed to just sit back and watch the russian army along with all the strategic territory and resources devolve into possible mayhem all while they were fighting a war against a common enemy one would idealistically hope that the imperialist powers would allow a nation to have self determination but they arent called imperialist nations for nothing they will oppose any challenge to their global hegemony so no there is no reason to have expected them not to try and interfere with the bolshevik revolution
socialism,not_removed,but rojava actually exists today so you can easily counter arguments that every attempt has failed since none are around any more the same with catalonia paris or the uft none failed they were crushed by outside millitaries
socialism,not_removed,its all we got so we gotta deal with it until we can make better onez
socialism,not_removed,you dont have to pay to get the intellectual property so its free as we can clearly see here you can also rehost the image without any credit on a site that has ads on its own and not get into any lawsuit trouble which is the case for most if not all webcomics anyway they seem to be rehosted a ton and artists seem to not give a fuck i dont know what do you even want from smbc at this point to not be thiefs to stop having a website and a name in case anyone wants to give the original artist credit for their work to stop earning money from their work because of course we all are able do that in the capitalist world
socialism,not_removed,do you have more information somewhere on this idea its intriguing and id like more info
socialism,not_removed,all they have to do is show up to one of those centers completely sober the homeless around me usually cant stay sober longer than an hour i know mental health plays a huge factor but its not like the help isnt there mental issues or not they refuse to get clean for just one fucking day to turn their lives around that gets pretty god damn frustrating after a while to the point you just dont care
socialism,not_removed,this is america where we pin blame on the final outcome instead of addressing the situation that caused it much easier to judge people from a distance than it is to tackle socialeconomic issues at their source
socialism,not_removed,some of the most important mathematicians physicists of the century were russian of mathrmaticians and scientists around at the time you talk to would wax poetic about how good the soviet union was at math an science
socialism,not_removed,so are you for or against working class revolution socialism and communism both stem from that event
socialism,not_removed,socialisms goal is to create a communist society marxian socialism to be picky thats because there were different socialisms that came before marx however here we are all materialists as far as i know
socialism,not_removed,so what part of democratically controlled workplaces caused those countries to be shit
socialism,not_removed,can you type out the bad aspects of socialism please point out how those countries arewere bad
socialism,not_removed,each case that you stated had a small hierarchy with more moneypower therefore were not actual implementations of socialism
socialism,not_removed,large successful well known influential those dont sound like definitions of democracy even nonsocialist people who try to actually be precise about this sort of thing put the us down in rank out of the world httpsenwikipediaorgwikidemocracyindex
socialism,not_removed,for the vast majority of human history we lived in protocommunist societies where resources where shared communally and class conflict and other sorts of social antagonisms like racism sexism homophobia transphobia were fairly negligible factors in society this seems like too strong a claim to make the problem is that the discourse that modernity has produced surrounding sexuality which gave rise to words like homosexuals didnt exists in other societies but this does not entail that primitive societies did not have harsh social consequences for abnormal behavior nor that they werent hierarchical or often deeply violent modernity did not invent hierarchies nor did it invent bigotry rather it is a specific historical way of organizing productive forces and relations either way theres no real way in which one could substantiate your claim each successive leap we have taken in economic systems has always sublated the inherent contradictions of the previous one see i cant take such a hegelian view of history seriously and i dont think any selfrespecting modern philosopher or historian would either there is no internal logic to our history other than the one we project on it if anything cold war point to the disastrous consequences of such a view of history capitalism nationalsocialism ussr catholicism i think you could also quite convincingly argue that such a view of history entails a distinctly christian conception of history check out the lowithblumenberg debate on secularization for example of course this does not mean that society would be better off if it was in a more socialist way but we should also take seriously the contingency of our place in history and take care not to base our ideology primarily on thinkers a lot has happened since then
socialism,not_removed,its not free you pay by visiting the website which provides ad revenue and gives you the option of buying their merchandise or joining his patreon when its rehosted the artist gets none of that so it is stealing i think youre also confused because smbc is the original artists website ps plenty of artists care one was linked in a different comment
socialism,not_removed,good point luckily you had already made that point and i had acknowledged it and essentially agreed with it in the comment youre responding to if im hungry and steal food im not gonna feel bad because some law was written to protect the property of the food hoarder similarly if i want to learn something im not going to feel bad for pirating or streaming a documentary in general if someone is hoarding excess anything then i dont care if someone without steals it for their own use however im not going to steal the food hoarders food and then set up a store and sell it and im not going to profit off of intellectual property that belongs to someone else either nor did i ever say that was okay or good in this case some intellectual property which undermines capitalism was stolen and shared for personal use and an amoral capitalist company profited incidentally is the capitalists ability to suck the profit out of the artists work a problem yeah i can agree with that but its only one part of the story the rest of the story is that capitalism was undermined by free flowing information and ill finish with an unrelated point id suggest turning down the outrage everything that is not perfect is not outrageous we need to have a scale to things here if we call the sharing of this meme an outrage then what words do we have left to describe environmental degradation starvation and homelessness if everything is outrageous then nothing is outrageous
socialism,not_removed,i think you completely missed my point
socialism,not_removed,there is actually decent information to suggest that housing first models to address homelessness are very effective housing first does not require that they abstain from drug or alcohol use it just provides housing first as the name suggests this is often paired with supportive housing which include services like a social worker mental health counseling job training help etc there is evidence that shows that this is an effective way of dealing with the problem of homelessness sources httpwwwendhomelessnessorglibraryentryhousingfirstfactsheet httpwwwendhomelessnessorglibraryentrywhatishousingfirst in addition to the moral aspect of housing first some studies also show that it reduces the financial burdens on municipalities by reducing emergency room visits and incarceration expenses which are usually attendant with homelessness sources meghan lewit sheltering homeless saves money study says usc news november at p national alliance to end homelessness cost savings with permanent supportive housing and graph march httpwwwendhomelessnessorglibraryentrycostsavingswithpermanentsupportivehousing jennifer perlman john parvensky denver housing first collaborative cost benefit analysis and program outcomes report december
socialism,not_removed,httpwwwcurbedcommapstinyhousesforthehomeless
socialism,not_removed,id find you a list of capitalist inventions but i cant seem to find one most likely because the list would be too long
socialism,not_removed,ill answer for him i dont know what the fuck im talking about
socialism,not_removed,i mean thats not really true nor are all materialists marxists but thats fine
socialism,not_removed,you are the confused one here this is the comment i was refering to
socialism,not_removed,i think you may have missed his too if i have it right youre saying that theyve been neglected so long that theyve actually learned to stop seeking help hes saying that regardless of any help they will keep doing the same thing day after day i dont know the solution to homelessness i do however think there is more than one cause that creates it in the first place there are the mentally ill who fall off of societies radar there are the criminals whose past has prevented them from attaining work the drug addicts who spend every single cent that should be used to house them on the drugs that run their lives there is the general economic crisis shrinking the middle class expanding the lower class and subsequently pushing the lowest members into the streets almost certainly more fixing the problems are hard so people ignore it idk what do you think we should do
socialism,not_removed,fair enough wrote it in a hurry not all materialists were marxists but to be marxist you have to be materialist otherwise that would be revisionism wouldnt it wait somebody could subscribe to his economicpolitical view but not his phylosphical one cattocommunism is a thing afterall now that i think about it oh well ill send myself to a reeducation camp in a couple of months my university is bruning me out
socialism,not_removed,my bad i should have said how those countries economic systems wereare bad obviously we dont support genocide
socialism,not_removed,wouldnt it be more accurate to say that modernity gave rise to our capacity to identify classify and recognize things like homosexuality and transgenderism as legitimate this was more or less my suggestion homosexual relations were obviously always a thing but identifying yourself and others on the basis of sexuality is a modern phenomenon that coincided with the rise of the modern nationstate and capitalism while i think it is obviously preferable to live in a society where people dont face social consequences for their sexual preferences i think that the need to classify oneself according to predetermined genders could be considered problematic arguably the need for these gender categories arose from the need for greater state control over the reproductive lives of its citizens although i also have a hard time imagining a different outlook on sexuality as to the second point i mainly wanted to point out that the way we view history changed we became more aware of the contingency of our knowledge the way we think of the world the way we formulate knowledge are products of our own historical context as such the western need to think of history as progress towards a certain endstate is a product of christian eschatology according to which the endpoint of history is the return of paradise on earth recognizing the idea of a history of progress as a distinctly western idea linked with our own particular history of christianity also should make us skeptical of any theory that claims such an end of history older thinkers here have a direct value they explain how we got here but if we appropriate their works we should also do so in light of the things that we have learned since then if our goal is to apply those thinkers to our present situation as opposed to an attempt to correctly situate an author in his historical context
socialism,not_removed,smbc is the artist the original comment is saying if he did watermark it it would be easier to find and better for him but he doesnt hes not saying smbc is stealing edit nvm i misread it doesnt change that it is theft in this case its by the op for likes second edit i was referring to this comment i dont know what do you even want from smbc at this point to not be thiefs to stop having a website and a name in case anyone wants to give the original artist credit for their work it makes it seem like you think smbc is rehosting when it is in fact the artists website forgive me if i misunderstood
socialism,not_removed,yes as a first world country our inventions dont all have to be lifechanging
socialism,not_removed,intellectual property is theft people who claim ownership of any intellectual property are thiefs because this way they deny this property from society its the same reasoning as with private property smbc doesnt deny anything from society their intellectual work is free to access and they dont fight anyone over hosting it on another site therefore the intellectual property condemnation shouldnt be applied to them please educate yourself on intellectual property rights by the way its quite fascinating topic
socialism,not_removed,i misunderstood wrote an edit above
socialism,not_removed,a mod overstepped bounds banned an artist of a popular leftist comic shitstorm ensues we unban and apologize people wont let it go thats the quick and easy
socialism,not_removed,ahah okay guess thats okay
socialism,not_removed,kind of utopian but hey everything is possible i would like to see humans reaching that point though but you cant just make the jump that hard from capitalism to rbe
socialism,not_removed,yes that jump is impossible but i do think automation is the key if we could simply automate our food production it would be a huge step once food is essentially free many of the worries of our poorest humans would disappear
socialism,not_removed,this article is somewhat unorganized and seems to dance around the point its making are you saying that rational discourse has failed us compared to the broad appeal of the right ill never accept that the abandonment of rational discourse can only lead to dogmatism at that point it doesnt matter if the left gets its way because any system founded on dogmatism rather than empirical principles will crumble
socialism,not_removed,not at all merely that the liberal conception of the world as being individuals arriving at mutually beneficial agreements through the mere exercise of reason is utopian human beings act out of primal instincts as well as moral imperatives not just cold calculus
socialism,not_removed,their
socialism,not_removed,ho dear
socialism,not_removed,are they trying to start a cold war before trump gets into office like why
socialism,not_removed,yeah dude why leave a positive legacy by granting clemency to people like chelsea manning or maybe closing gitmo when you can keep up this cock measuring contest with russia i swear to fuck liberals will kill us all with their negligence
socialism,not_removed,these diplomats were definitely spies we should all be clear on that point everyone uses diplomatic posts as cover for espionage the us just kicked out a few dozen russian spies in overtly public fashion
socialism,not_removed,which court
socialism,not_removed,ger dam russians get off my lawn
socialism,not_removed,it is commonly argued in the foreign policy community that we have essentially fallen back into a cold war for some time now there is a very good on it this does strike me as a bit of well poisoning however forcing the trump administration to actively take steps to reestablish ties with russia and thus the fissures between trump and the neocon wing of the gop will widen it does lead some credence to the obama administration taking the accusations of hacking seriously however personally i am somewhat agnostic leaning towards a view that the hacking was abetted by russia but with an aim to weaken clinton rather than elect trumplavrov at least seems to have no real fondness for him whether or not one takes the view that foreign policy analysis is just imperialist descriptor t is quite nuanced and important descriptor it also disabuses one quite quickly of notions of conspiracy people in cfr events are quite frank
socialism,not_removed,looks like there is already a state of war
socialism,not_removed,because our incoming president will be a puppet for the russian regimes interests and the outgoing president wants to make a few gestures toward making russia pay a penalty for that before he loses all power
socialism,not_removed,i watched democracy now yesterday and they had a guy on saying obama should take americas nukes off high alert so that trump cant fire them within minutes
socialism,not_removed,not sure why youre downvoted every government uses diplomats as covers for spies these ones just got caught the us didnt shutter the embassy in dc its kicking out a couple dozen spies whove been made they were already on the radar they just kicked the nest too hard this time
socialism,not_removed,what the hell imperialist propaganda is tolerated in this sub this comment has been upvoted and is standing as of hours ago absolutely disgusting
socialism,not_removed,i personally am waiting on solid proof but i am always ready to remind people to read the emails
socialism,not_removed,i am not sure about the puppet thing i mean the uscapitalists and the russian capitalists have had clashing interests in the past and i can see trump going back on his promises about russia simply judging from his cabinet but of course you could be right
socialism,not_removed,because our incoming president will be a puppet for the russian regime rpolitics is that way kiddo
socialism,not_removed,he isnt a puppet for russia stop watching cnn lol
socialism,not_removed,i listened to the same segment if there is anything i want obama to do in his last days of office it would be this dont let a madman like trump launch nukes within minutes
socialism,not_removed,some on the farleft seem to be under the impression that the us is the only country that engages in espionage and the us would never do anything with even a hint of justifiability hence the downvotes the truth is theres no good guys among states if us is guiltier than most in recent history its only because theyve been afforded the ripest opportunities and best resources not because they are a special evil in the world
socialism,not_removed,if the russians want to be so blatant with their meddling pending even the slightest form of proof its hard to see this as blatant
socialism,not_removed,please explain how pointing out the known realities of statecraft is imperialist propaganda
socialism,not_removed,i could see it either way on the one hand nothing about it is implausible and it is definitely possible the intelligence services have access to information that isnt public on the other they have something if a history of inflating threats and russia cyber steals election is a great way to secure extra budget funding either way whatever happened and what the response is marks a pretty worrying turn in relations as for the emails i really dont remember any being so bad at least as someone who has followed politics for a whileit is all pretty standard political op stuff my interpretation of the whole pizzagate thing is because there isnt anything really scandalous in them
socialism,not_removed,trump is a traitor okay maybe traitor is the wrong word since im certain hes never held a sincere loyalty to anyone or anything other than himself and perhaps his immediate family either way yes its meant to complicate his efforts to sell out the us
socialism,not_removed,the puppet thing always felt strange for me the elites are always looking out for their own interests of course they would know each other and be friends with each other i mean joe bidens son holds a high position for a ukrainian oil company and kissinger is a longtime buddy with putin this is how the elites work also totally random note why is it that we call countries that dont curtail to american interests are called regimes assad regime russian regime cuban regime venezuelan regime but in countries like saudi arabia the news doesnt call the government there a regime i dont know im blabbing take it as you will haha
socialism,not_removed,not necessarily a puppet just an admirer and fellow traveler who owes a few favors
socialism,not_removed,this assumes obama is really threatened by a trump presidency or on the side of the proletariat he is not as he has proved time and time again
socialism,not_removed,because its a lie
socialism,not_removed,yeah nothing in any of the emails was actually bad the outrage is almost entirely trump propoganda that many sanders supporters ate up
socialism,not_removed,just look at the reaction between the death of fidel castro a perhaps authoritative figure and the king abdullah of saudi arabi an absolute monarch obama even canceled his trip to india to fucking kiss the ass of the new king
socialism,not_removed,you dont say
socialism,not_removed,i feel like the word you are looking for is not friends they are definitely not allies or friends except for when they band against the working class but their most common ideology is every man for himself and their scheming and risktaking reflects that
socialism,not_removed,this oh also a guy who may be completely financially in bed with russian oligarchs but maybe that isnt important because he won the election without having to prove at least in the most superficial way possible of releasing his tax records that he wasnt
socialism,not_removed,of course he is not on the side of the proletariat but it is clear that obama does not have much regard for trump either
socialism,not_removed,whats a lie that governments use diplomatic posts for espionage or that these particular diplomats are spies the former is a well established fact and i dont see any good reason to doubt the latter unless you can provide one
socialism,not_removed,or look at the framing of each leader in the media go soft on the saudi royals and rail against cuba could you imagine if the shit that happens in the us happened in cuba police killing unarmed black people death squads killing innocent people flint water crisis regime actively poisoning citizens
socialism,not_removed,yeah i couldnt really find the right word i was looking for but were both on the same page
socialism,not_removed,yes much better than american pride where investment banks sponsor floats and you get harassed by entrepreneurs selling designer underwear

socialism,not_removed,its from a bloc within the annual pride parade so the entire thing is for the rights of lbgtiaqpeople with our bloc presenting a radical anticapitalist perspective
socialism,not_removed,i think the backlash against the pinkblack bloc is overblown and i think both antifascism and resistence are positive things however i cant speak as to the actions of individuals and i think individual threatsconfrontations are usually non or counterproductive

socialism,not_removed,i want to burn the us prison system to the ground
socialism,not_removed,hes a total dickhead and an uncle tom
socialism,not_removed,what the fuck
socialism,not_removed,why is this story not getting more traction it needs to spread
socialism,not_removed,abolishing jails is not a good idea while it is a corrupt and broken system there still exists dangerous people who need to be kept out of the public theres no need for an all or nothing response
socialism,not_removed,worst part is that in he won by against socialist httpsenwikipediaorgwikiangelanicolewalker the red scare is still strong looks like
socialism,not_removed,yeah how have these people not been dragged from the homes and thrown in prison yet is killing babies legal now
socialism,not_removed,exile or community service
socialism,not_removed,absolutely im not advocating for violence against him or his police force but if it were to happen the enforcers would likely be unimposed by me
socialism,not_removed,she ran as a socialist for sheriff against a democrat the democrat was going to get the democratic establishment and the republicans were never gonna vote for someone more left to get rid of a democrat i dont think its red scare thing it just seems poorly planned really also you know she doesnt have policing experience which regardless of whether or not acab applies is still something the electorate look for in a sheriff
socialism,not_removed,cue the pro life arguments
socialism,not_removed,exile to where nowhere else would want them either if full socialism was implemented its not like you can just ship criminals into space or into the ocean also some criminals may not be receptive to community service and may not be safe to interact with the overall community of course this is more serious offenses and not just average people
socialism,not_removed,oh sorry i thought police experience was required to run for sherrif when it comes to the democrats on the department clarke is only registered as such but his views are conservative still im not familiar with mpd so this is all coming from some quick googling
socialism,not_removed,i have a parable its called keeping it real a capitalism story when we were brainstorming this idea i openly spoke up against it i told them that it was unethical to block a drivers payments without researching the complaint to make sure it was the drivers fault many of the uber drivers in some countries do not own the cars they drive they are owned by rich people who give the drivers a fixed monthly salary and take the money uber pays the drivers from their bank accounts so if a payment is blocked because of a customer complaint the drivers may go home without the pay they need to feed their families when i voiced my concern looked at me and said there is no place for ethics in this business sweetheart we are not a charity
socialism,not_removed,this is the best tldr i could make reduced by im a bot i am sure there are plenty of women still working at san francisco office who have many such stories to tell married with two children he is well known for being abusive towards anyone below his payscale and for being casually racist towards foreign employees who are here on work permits and abusive towards women at work even though i work at uber any longer the damage that was done to me by work environment ruined my spirit version tldrs so far pms and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome top keywords
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately unionizing the tech industry has proven particularly challenging if not outright impossible
socialism,not_removed,i was attending a talk the other day by a female film director and the discussion got onto the role of gender in the film industry somebody asked whether the best way to deal with sexism was to call it out when it happened the director basically said that in reality if you call out sexism you can essentially become ostracised given the long term relationships that develop in film making and the short term nature of many shoots if youre the new girl and call out one of your more seasoned colleagues for sexism its more likely that youll be the one not asked back for the next shoot and if you get a reputation as a trouble maker youll have a much harder job breaking into the industry its incredibly sad that this is what our society allows
socialism,not_removed,there are some protounion efforts httpswwwfacebookcomtechworkerscoalition
socialism,not_removed,so what can we do
socialism,not_removed,could it be argued that the white collar industry is so hard to unionize because of the mindset of its workers that is to say they believe themselves to be wealthy petitebourgeoise when they are in fact proles thus forcing them to operate with the bourgeoise classs interests rather than their own
socialism,not_removed,yeah ive heard of these but the progress is slow
socialism,not_removed,that is to say they believe themselves to be wealthy petitebourgeoise when they are in fact proles really youd say this about tech workers in sf for instance who live in a city where the average cost of homes within the city limits are million
socialism,not_removed,indeed tech and white collar industries in general need unions despite their work being more individualistic supposedly salaried employees are being exploited with ridiculous overtime policies etc placated by benefits google defends opposing unions due to their corporate amenities for instance which is just bullshit in the industry i work in game dev software engineers are regularly paid with pizza for what is essentially mandatory overtime to meet a deadline i just really wish i knew how to overcome the barriers to unionizing the white collar world
socialism,not_removed,most tech workers dont actually make that much most tech workers dont live in san fran proper and commute there those that do live in san fran often have a lot and i do mean a lot of roommates to afford it regardless of pay programmers are abused and taken advantage of im not referring to entrepreneurs at start ups and shit im talking about your average software dev working in a cubicle at a megacorp like oracle or even microsoft sure its higher paying than a lot of work ie socalled blue collar work but the fact is that the vast majority of tech workers no matter how well off do not own the means of production and still have to sell their labor to a bourgeoise class
socialism,not_removed,okay fair enough i guess we just talked past each other about who we were talking about specifically
socialism,not_removed,i mean hey he did temporarily nazi policy moreorless reversed the decline in living standards of the majority of the german workingclass provided employment through state programmes and public works developed sprawling corporatist labour organisations in fact there were even labour shortages by the late but it was all undertaken on the basis of the transformation of germany into a debtfuelled war economy as such nazism didnt solve the contradictions of capitalism it ended up intensifying them many times over and making aggressive territorial expansionism and the expropriation of property from undesirables a necessity to stave off economic collapse for a perfect example of this see görings famous guns or butter speech in which he exhorts the crowd do you want guns or do you want butter the answer coming thundering back both
socialism,not_removed,well he did do some good things for the economy however much of the growth was fueled by hidden debt eg mefo bills state taking over massive amounts of companies the jewish population having their things taken and jobs taken by germans more debt that said the welfare military and infrastructure were doing very well if you dont mind the lack of privatisation
socialism,not_removed,a lot of things that hitler took credit for were already being planned before the nazi party even took power such as the autobahn the myth of nazi efficiency is exactly that with exception to some intelligent decisions such as appointing albert speer hitler was an economic dilettante who did not care for economics aside from what would make germany rearm faster and prepare for war quicker for that end he turned germany into a totalitarian state capitalist economy brimming with corruption whatever good things that hitler did for the economy are reversed by the fact it was all for a war that any sane man could tell you was going to end disastrously
socialism,not_removed,hitler interested economic progress from the weimar republic and took credit for it
socialism,not_removed,thanks for the reply i live in southern indiana and its annoying to see how many people support hitler economically and politically
socialism,not_removed,with zakiajafri
socialism,not_removed,post it in the
socialism,not_removed,why its not about corbyn besides a mega thread lasting this long means no one is aware about the most recent news dont think its a good idea
socialism,not_removed,please keep all jeremy corbynlabour party discussion within this thread any other threads will be removed
socialism,not_removed,can you explain why youre doing this mega thread thing in my opinion it limits discussion and limits the amount of people that can be reached really massive news stories are only seen by a handful of people
socialism,not_removed,because this subreddit is called rsocialism that means it is a place to discuss socialism the labour party are at best a social democratic party if you want to discuss the labour party go to rsocialdemocracy or rlabouruk weve had this discussion already threads about jeremy corbyn and the labour party have dominated the front page over the last week or so i know i personally have removed dozens of links about him there are other things to talk about than jeremy corbyn and people should be given the opportunity to do so not everyone here lives in the united kingdom either they are massive stories to you that doesnt mean everyone else cares as much i know i certainly dont and i live in britain
socialism,not_removed,surely it should be a broad church sub for socialist ideas also you saw yourself that majority of people on here disagree hes only a socdem but thats fine youve got the authority at the end of the day
socialism,not_removed,and people think capitalism is a meritocracy
socialism,not_removed,clearly this is proof that bootstrapping abilities are genetic
socialism,not_removed,my partner bought an italian cookbook by lorenza de medici a while back and i wondered if she was one of those medici yep good recipes though
socialism,not_removed,in a similar vein british social mobility or lack thereof since the norman invasion in
socialism,not_removed,ezio what did you do
socialism,not_removed,honestly find this pretty cool as wrong as it is its like something out of a book with powerful and old noble families holding on to power for centuries
socialism,not_removed,woah they must have all worked like really hard
socialism,not_removed,do we know how this situation compares in say france or russia countries that had largescale revolutions
socialism,not_removed,this doesnt surprise me in the least i remember a few years ago i read an article on the guardians website about english surnames which mentioned in a passing fashion a bunch of names that entered english with the norman invasion of the article failed to comment on the fact that without exception they were names that are considered posh nowadays the british class system is essentially the norman class system
socialism,not_removed,great now we know who to throw against the wall
socialism,not_removed,can you xpost this to rcapitalismfacts please
socialism,not_removed,i hate to be that guy but within years and a given old world region wont most people in general be descended from those wealthy families like theres probably hundreds more poor medici than wealthy ones
socialism,not_removed,youre being ironic but when this was posted on reconomics this was a commonly expressed opinion you can see the comments
socialism,not_removed,give me years of wealth and i reckon id come up with a couple of decent recipes aha
socialism,not_removed,merit ensures you succeed wealth and status gives you a fighting chance that youre ever heard by a proper audience

socialism,not_removed,ezio auditore came from a family of wealthy bankers its a good chance he family would have been wealthy today many assassins were members of the bourgeoisie houseofauditore on wikia the house of auditore was a noble family of the italian city of florence its prominence in httpassassinscreedwikiacomwikihouseofauditore
socialism,not_removed,they almost predate capitalism thats sort of impressive if nothing else its going to be even more satisfying to get rid of them
socialism,not_removed,i dont know if theres a proper way to xpost i just posted the original link and said on the comment it was posted here first
socialism,not_removed,thats a false it helps but by no means is it even a critical component to making money years ago i was homeless in los angeles today im worth about anecdotal bootstrap jerk incoming but from my anecdotal experience those who go from poor or middle class to rich ie me tend to have the following traits in common moxieambition above average intelligence incredible critical thinking skills ie naturally think outside the box drivedetermination not afraid of taking big financial other risks perseverancechip on the shoulder dont forget stunning looks and a gigantic schlong willing to sacrifice important aspects of life like time with family marriage relationships etc for success awesome see problems as opportunities to excel rather than walls that cant be climbed over ie they dont stop for road blocks he says in hindsight about problems that were apparently solvable seeing as he solved them luckpeople who open doors for them there we go i went from homeless at to working in a liquor store for minimum wage at to working in a jewelry store at to starting my own jewelry company at to worth at why dont we just all own jewelry companies i started my company with that i saved up over years of making peanuts good luck getting that far on minimum wage
socialism,not_removed,what it probably shows is that intelligence is both highly heritable of variance and subject to assortative mating i want to get off reconomic s spooky ride

socialism,not_removed,thats just what im saying the medicis would never have survived without his help which tbh was really weird considering the more shit disturbing themes of the franchise i guess its hard to write a good story in renaissance italy without involving nobles although the house of auditore didnt retain its prominence after his dads death anyway did it maybe some of its money but not its stature
socialism,not_removed,not edward
socialism,not_removed,the bourgeoise are the new aristocracy i question their old aristocratsnobles allegiance to capitalist interests though marx called many of the old families of european nobility feudal socialists but im not so sure it holds true today
socialism,not_removed,some of the nobles survived by fleeing the country during the revolutionscivil war none of their political movements really went anywhere hitler tried to ally with a few of the remaining grand dukes and felix yusupov the tsars nieces husband but they turned him down because even they had standards however some of the emigre political movements spawned eurasianism so we have them to thank for the likes of dugin
socialism,not_removed,the title cant be the same afaik add xpost from rsocialism to get around that
socialism,not_removed,your brain works the same way as your ancestors did thousands of years ago if anything intelligence rates have risen over time despite the overprevelence of those considered unintelligent throughout history its the reason why the idiocracy theory of intellectual decline is bullshit and still remains bullshit even if it is on wsj education on the other hand is inherited by educated parents ensuring good education for their children and because the well educated can often afford good education for their progeny intellgence is nothing more than the sum of whatever arbitrary measurements society deems smart
socialism,not_removed,no wonder i see so much eugenics and antirace mixing apologia all over reddit
socialism,not_removed,the old nobility of europe hated the bourgeoisie because they thought the bourgeoisie would disrupt the order and class system of society by riling up the proletariat the thought was that they need to keep the bourgeoisie in check to prevent them from messing up the order and causing the proletariat from revolting its actually pretty funny considering these are the enemies of the proletariat and they hate each other marx also uses the umbrella term reactionary socialism to describe this and several other forms of socialism which wed basically call heretical
socialism,not_removed,because we dislike the bourgeoise almost as much as you do upon their investiture all noblemen in every country i know of in western europeat least take vows to safeguardtend to their land and their people the bourgeoise are motivated by gaining money something we find to be repulsive and undignified a gentleman should never know how much money is in his bank account we are motivated by honor and prestige honor usually comes from military service and the prestige from how long your family has been able to produce men who can lead tldr the middle class are concerned with increasing their wallets while nobles are concerned with the welfare of their demense
socialism,not_removed,i feel it is a bit too universal of a statement to say the nobility hated the bourgeoisie in many countries there was a lot of overlap between the two classes if you take prerevolutionary france for example the nobility was increasingly involved in bourgeois activities such as trade and the bourgeoisie attempted to enter the nobility through the marriage and the buying of offices this is not to say there wasnt conflict between the two classes obviously the french revolution happened however i think hatred you are talking about emerged with the industrial bourgeoisie and the level of conflictcooperation between the two groups differed from country to country and region to region
socialism,not_removed,even russia the new bourgeoisie were very comfortable with the tsar one of the reasons why a proletarian revolution could occur in the context of a society with predominately feudal relations and a feudal state the bourgeoisie did not feel the need to seize state power while they were doing just fine with the tsar in charge
socialism,not_removed,why yes but even if a rich bourgeois managed to buy a title back then you might be surprised to find that to this day that family will be known as a noble of the cloth though this might sound innocuous to you its actually quite derisive as there are two classes nobles of the sword which were the real noble families and nobles of the cloth which were the middle class who bought themselves a position
socialism,not_removed,i shouldve been more specific i was strictly talking about the modern bourgeoise who were industrialists i agree though not all bourgeoise disliked nobility depending on the country
socialism,not_removed,i doubt international policy focuses on achieving world peace but maintaining american hegemony
socialism,not_removed,having known a few that have flirted with those degrees or actually went through them ive noticed that of things tends to happen they flounder postgraduation as the market keeps them down world peace policy making is not a profitable venture and does not have many jobs associated with it so they end up going into something​ else they get business degrees or are coopted into working for business someone i know with international relations now works for goldmansachs the degree was really to bolster how to game the system better ive known quite a few people that took classes or got these degrees specifically for business they are hardcore idealistic and really try to get into something akin to policy making this usually takes the route of poverty in the nonprofit sector where they get burnt out after a while or government jobs which ultimately only serves the interests of their country and capitalism and they either take on the im working from the inside idea to stay sane or get burnt out there may be a few superstars but they have no platform to stand on
socialism,not_removed,this was a good video the guy had a lot to say i just feel like there should be more questions covered and discussions between the too so to the interviewer break it up a bit and ask questions a bit more when interviewing someone who has good arguments and you agree with them you should ask even more questions to expand on the idea and create new discussions and discoveries for both people and the viewers the guy was brilliant so hes going to on and on about a subject you have to interrupt it a bit and ask him to expand on things

socialism,not_removed,inflation does not necessarily imply an increase in the price level relative to wages it just means an increase in the price level relative to the price level of some base year so you can have inflation and increasing wages its still inflation though its true that any given amount of inflation decreases the purchasing power of any given quantity of wages so i can see where you are coming from i havent really explored the relationship between class struggle and inflation i agree though it sounds fascinating i also dont know to much about marxs monetary theories i suppose i could see how his position would be similar to the monetarists from my understanding monetarists like friedman and schwartz reasserted the importance of the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiquantitytheoryofmoney which argues a direct relationship between money supply and the price level at least in the short run and i would assume marx would agree but as you say for different reasons an increase in the supply of money would dilute the labor content of each unit of money and so in order to equalize the value embodied by money with that embodied in commodities youd have to increase the price thats my thinking at least i might have it all wrong like i said im not super well read on this topic
socialism,not_removed,inflation without money how would there be inflation
socialism,not_removed,inflation does not necessarily imply an increase in the price level relative to wages it just means an increase in the price level relative to the price level of some base year so you can have inflation and increasing wages its still inflation though its true that any given amount of inflation decreases the purchasing power of any given quantity of wages so i can see where you are coming from thanks for clarifying this edit though you could think about this in a strictly marxist sense which i believe to be correct and argue that there is really no difference between equals and if you understand general price levels and the price of labor power as strictly relative quantities this however leads to some interesting questions and conclusions if inflation could be used as a tool by the bourgeoisie to artificially lower wages both temporarily and in the long run why is it that inflation isnt constantly through the roof i think the answer to that question is actually rather simple high inflation results in superprofits for some industries and a reduction in profits for those industries that cannot sell their goods at a higher price again relative to wages which is perhaps the abstraction value misunderstood by those who believe in the transformation problem so inflation has extremely risky and in some ways unpredictable consequences for capitalists high inflation would result in winners and losers and this to me in a way proves that any assumptions in economics about perfect competition among capitalists are outrageous in a state of perfect competition inflation would naturally have to be through the roof as less profitable industries would constantly be priced out of the market
socialism,not_removed,im talking about marx critique of capitalism
socialism,not_removed,if inflation could be used as a tool by the bourgeoisie to artificially lower wages both temporarily and in the long run why is it that inflation isnt constantly through the roof because producers in capitalism do not generally speaking collude to fix prices in the economic literature they are called price takers not price setters that is through competition with one another they are driven to reduce prices this is bounded of course by their productions costs high inflation results in superprofits for some industries and a reduction in profits for those industries that cannot sell their goods at a higher price hmmm i think the story is a little more complicated than that high prices are not exactly the same as inflation since inflation is higher prices throughout the whole economy not just in one industry but putting that aside for a moment high prices dont necessarily lead to a higher rate of profit the rate of profit is scv the ratio of surplus value to factor prices both variable and constant sure its nice to sell your goods for high prices but not when your costs are also high so firms arent making superprofits because their prices are highthey make superprofits only when their prices are high relative to costs and when that ratio the rate of profit is higher than competing firms in a state of perfect competition inflation would naturally have to be through the roof as less profitable industries would constantly be priced out of the market i dont think i follow in a state of perfect competition firms are driven to reduce prices to the level at which their marginal costs marginal revenue the bourgeoisie as a class are also constrained in their actions by the logic of capitalism they are not allowed to set whatever high price they want they would price themselves out of the market hope that cleared some stuff up if you have more questions dont hesitate to ask away
socialism,not_removed,because producers in capitalism do not generally speaking collude to fix prices in the economic literature they are called price takers not price setters that is through competition with one another they are driven to reduce prices this is bounded of course by their productions costs and i dispute that the rise of cartells corporations and generally increased centralization in the economy make this assumption sketchy at best i know thats what we are taught in economics classes but i think its at best a very generous interpretation of reality in favour of bourgeois economics hmmm i think the story is a little more complicated than that high prices are not exactly the same as inflation since inflation is higher prices throughout the whole economy thats right but the point was simply that high inflation favors those industries that can sell similar quantities at a higher price and so inflation slowly and naturally squeezes out those businesses that cannot adapt to constant price increases relative to purchasing powerwagesof all general goods including thier own product sure its nice to sell your goods for high prices but not when your costs are also high now think about what you are saying here when the general prices of goods increase and the price of labor power doesnt there is a noticable change in scv in that v would now be lower how can you not see this sure its nice to sell your goods for high prices but not when your costs are also high so firms arent making superprofits because their prices are highthey make superprofits only when their prices are high relative to costs and when that ratio the rate of profit is higher than competing firms right you are making my point profits are directly related to costs thats my point if you can sell at a higher price and the relative costs of your product stays the same or only marginally increases you make a superprofit which is exactly why you have to view labor costs and general prices as relative to eachother its weird you are like switching from a marxist analysis to totally irrelevant mainstream economic concepts that have nothing to do with the point i dont think i follow in a state of perfect competition firms are driven to reduce prices to the level at which their marginal costs marginal revenue the bourgeoisie as a class are also constrained in their actions by the logic of capitalism they are not allowed to set whatever high price they want they would price themselves out of the market hope that cleared some stuff up if you have more questions dont hesitate to ask away what im saying is that inflation would be profitable to some industries and hurt others i think i had a brainfart when i equated that with perfect competition though it certainly puts into question the assumption of wether or not perfect competition is even possible which i dispute for various reasons anyway
socialism,not_removed,the rise of cartells corporations and generally increased centralization in the economy make this assumption sketchy at best this is a misnomer the capitalist economy has never been a level playing field and increased centralization in no way prevents competition it only takes one competitor to overthrow another michael roberts cites the example of the publishing industry which was very centralized companies do not need and particularly do not want to collude with others to fix prices even cartels like opec collude only to be competitive with other players in the market namely the united states tho thats less the case now than it was in when companies do act in concert it is most often because their interests align due to the conditions of the market rather than them colluding to actively shape the conditions of the market the exception of course being with government regulation that applies across an industry or industries and thats when they send alec and national association of manufacturers in
socialism,not_removed,and i dispute that you dispute that there is competition among producers in capitalism thats frankly ridiculous yeah there are pockets of centralization but competition is a central feature of market system theres a reason the pizza place down the street from me cant charge exorbitant prices for their products if they did business would just flow to the other pizza place down the street from me its not bourgeois economics its just how capitalism works i mean competition is a central part of marxian economics if there were no competition his analysis collapses what would be the mechanism by which rates of profit are equalized across industries what would be the force that drives technical progress the force that compels capitalists to invest in labor saving technologies now think about what you are saying here when the general prices of goods increase and the price of labor power doesnt there is a noticable change in scv in that v would now be lower how can you not see this why are you holding wages constant see you dont understand what inflation is i just explained to you that wages may stay constant keep pace with or even outpace inflation its still inflation higher wages can even cause inflation so when you say inflation would help industries that can charge higher prices thats not necessarily true its weird you are like switching from a marxist analysis to totally irrelevant mainstream economic concepts that have nothing to do with the point this is because i come from a mainstream econ background but my analysis of capitalism is also informed by marxist economics and in my experience they are not all that in contradiction with one another but i know this shit pretty well so when you are say something completely silly like if inflation hurts workers why dont all firms increase prices i feel like i should explain why thats not the case not really sorry if it comes off sounding bourgeois because firms do not get to set whatever price they wanteven if there was no competition firms would still not be able to charge whatever price they wanted even monopolists are constrained by the logic of capitalism what im saying is that inflation would be profitable to some industries and hurt others this is true inflation is good for example for firms which have large debt obligations because higher than expected inflation reduces the real interest rate it could be quite bad for firms that are creditorseven if it reduces the real cost of wages if we assume wages are held constant but inflation may also cause a depreciation of the national currency which would be quite bad for major importers of products as foreign goods become relatively more expensive on the flip side it would be good for exporters its a much more complicated story than the one youre telling the point however is that it is not a conscious decision of the bourgeois class what the price level of society is there is no secret cabal of capitalist fat cats conspiring to set prices high to reduce the relative cost of wages there is rather a logic to capitalism certain laws of motion that are outside the control of the bourgeois class
socialism,not_removed,this is a misnomer the capitalist economy has never been a level playing field and increased centralization in no way prevents competition i dont follow centralization results in less competition by definition its really quite simple for where there are less competitors there is going to be less competition i dont think ive argued that it prevents competition entirely but if your understanding of economics doesnt account for an increase in centralization then its simply flawed lenin wrote about this topic extensively so i suggest you check out imperialism the highest stage of capitalism
socialism,not_removed,why are you holding wages constant see you dont understand what inflation is no im explicitly not doing that i specifically argued that you have to view the price levels of general goods and the price of labor power as strictly relative quantities you are totally strawmanning what im saying it doesnt matter if workers make more if everything costs more because firms do not get to set whatever price they wanteven if there was no competition firms would still not be able to charge whatever price they wanted even monopolists are constrained by the logic of capitalism it was a rhetorical question i even answered it myself and showed why the bourgeoisie isnt driving up inflation constantly now i know you think this is a strictly economc question but if the bourgeoisie really wanted to they could absolutely use the political sphere to drive up inflation the point however is that it is not a conscious decision of the bourgeois class what the price level of society is there is no secret cabal of capitalist fat cats conspiring to set prices high to reduce the relative cost of wages there is rather a logic to capitalism certain laws of motion that are outside the control of the bourgeois class its not a conscious decision of the bourgeoisie but labor laws employment rights etc very much factor into how the general prices of goods relate to the price of labor power and in that way there is absolutely a class struggle element to this i also dont really think wage push inflation is a terribly useful concept because you have to view the general price level relative to the price of labor power i understand how an increase in the price of labor power would result in an increase in the price of all general goods but its almost impossible for that to be a ratio so its totally irrelevant when you consider the price of labor power and general price level relative quantities
socialism,not_removed,ive read imperialism i actually what youre referring to is what lenin calls free competition the capitalist mythos that companies succeed based on how they compete in the market without considering crossindustry conglomerates and concentration of production free competition is like a hypothetical restrictions bidding process for a contractor in a construction process as lenin writes the closest thing to free competition only existed prior to the long depression of lenin also talks about domination by a financial oligarchy which is certainly the case today but the key word is oligarchy not tyranny the oligarchy dominates all of the market but in turn competes within itself goldman sachs vs morgan stanley bank of america vs jp morgan etc and even approaching close to a monopoly is just impossible for even the largest corporations in most industries when brian hunter of the hedge fund amaranth bought up of nymex natural gas securities of all us consumer gas the maintenance by margin requirements alone was impossible and they had no intentions of actually distributing housing or storing that gas the hedge fund subsequently collapsed in one of the most infamous trading failures in history total monopoly would require an unfathomable infrastructure google has come close with their of search engine market share and somehow managing to avoid but again still not a total monopoly market centralization is measured by the herfindahlthe economist lenin references in imperialismhirschman index hhi goes up when market share is divided between less businesses so a market of has a lower score than but competition does not necessarily change one way or the other for the companies with the largest share in both examples they are facing of the market competing with them hhi also goes up when the market share of one business increases at the expense of others but because of the tendency for production to concentrate the actors with smaller market shares begin to converge as aol and yahoo just did re google a good example of how this effect can pan out is the market for soft drinks here is division of market share in notice that both pepsi and coke lost market share to dr pepper and other and here is coke remains dominant but only as much as it was before but pepsis share has decreased majorly with the rise in popularity of energy drinks which mountain dew owns a lot of
socialism,not_removed,it doesnt matter if workers make more if everything costs more yes it does not from the perspective of workers purchasing power but with respect to other things in an economy see the real rate of interest or the relative values of currencies you cant just call an increase in the price level from one period to another not inflation just because workers wages also increased repeat after me inflation is x ptpt it is not that equation adjusted for changes in the price of the labor commodity because you have to view the general price level relative to the price of labor power no you dont for reasons ive already explained there are more components of economic growth than household consumption
socialism,not_removed,yes it does not from the perspective of workers purchasing power but with respect to other things in an economy but that doesnt matter because its a zero sum difference everything costs more but everyone spends more at the same time
socialism,not_removed,no lets assume wages keep pace with inflation as inflation increases more than expected you say it doesnt matter because its a zero sum difference well inflation increases more than expected so that we have a falling real rate of interest in the economy leading to increased business investment ceteris peribus this causes national income and employment to increase how does that not matter or the opposite case happens inflation and wages decline and the economy contracts as debt obligations become more expensive to pay even though commodity prices have fallen see it matters theres more to the picture than commodity prices and wages there are more things in an economy than wage goods
socialism,not_removed,look i get it i understand how inflation on its own effects various other aspects of the economy but i specifically said in my original post that this is not what im interested in what im trying to understand is how the price of the commodity labor power relates to the prices of all other commodities because this aspect of the economy seems to directly factor into class struggle so i dont know why you felt the need to derail the conversation to a point that i have no idea what you are even trying to argue here
socialism,not_removed,if you guys are capitalists then stop utilizing inventions that were made thanks to feudalism otherwise you guys arent practicing true capitalism and youre a disgrace to the cause
socialism,not_removed,capitalism assembled my laptop damn i thought it was human labor
socialism,not_removed,china is communist capitalism made your iphone pick one
socialism,not_removed,so is this satire or not
socialism,not_removed,lmao at these liberal capitalists saying that there shouldnt be a king but the building their factories on the kings land what hypocrites
socialism,not_removed,i think op was serious
socialism,not_removed,im guessing you think communism more government you do know that for example the internet was developed thanks to tax payer funded research likewise the space program is also communistic by this definition im gonna presume you dont intend to throw scientists working at nasa out of a helicopter also daily reminder chile was a dictatorial shithole the policies of the chicago school essentially served the country up to foreign financial elites and industries your glorious free market paradise was actually a neoliberal shithole where children were fainting in schools due to hunger that is without nixon making the economy scream like he did with allende capitalism is corporatism
socialism,not_removed,what do you propose we do when robots and ai see to most of our consumerist needs
socialism,not_removed,why would i be delusional to think that
socialism,not_removed,communist capitalism that well known economic system of course
socialism,not_removed,also want to see a state with true communism lol this isnt a debate communism with smug knowitalls who know nothing about capitalism or communism sub
socialism,not_removed,i mean who needs wikipedia with this guy around
socialism,not_removed,so why are you calling china communist when you admit that its state capitalist in the same breath you know thats a contradiction right
socialism,not_removed,this content is not appropriate for this subreddit
socialism,not_removed,at least he was polite
socialism,not_removed,oh no they didnt break the law such fascists
socialism,not_removed,you really think americans in the military are ignorant to the real purpose behind what theyre doing and why they have a job youd be surprised it doesnt long once in for most to drop the pretense of sacrificing for my country and defending my family back home and all the other patriotism that mightve not existed in the first place because most just join for the job benefits travel etc
socialism,not_removed,good resource comrade
socialism,not_removed,things like this is why im terrified to let my boyfriend go anywhere alone and we dont even have hate crime in anywhere near the regularity they do in the uk as an aside my friends son is half pakistani her husband is from pakistan and any time im with them in public you would want to see the looks she gets especially if she forgets her wedding ring going to the shop or anything
socialism,not_removed,post it in the
socialism,not_removed,the marxist student federation already has marxist societies established in universities up and down the country and if you get in touch may be able to help you establish one httpmarxiststudentcom its affiliated with the socialist appeal which is the british section of the international marxist tendency edit though judging by your flair perhaps you would not be too happy to set up a trotskyistorientated marxist society anyway its just a suggestion
socialism,not_removed,careful mate youre gonna be stealing the imts thunder
socialism,not_removed,good luck i go to uoliverpool and our marxist society was basically a momentum support group unfortunately i think they must have folded recently as i cant find any recent mention of their activity
socialism,not_removed,well the vicepresident of the club is a trot and another founding member is an ancom so dont be thinking us mls are all tank and no solidarity
socialism,not_removed,de leonism a variant of syndicalism based on orthodox marxism and democratic socialism anarchist communism a form of communism where the state and class society are abolished immediately and simultaneously communalism murray bookchins libertarian socialist ideology that was a break from anarchism and included social ecology councilism the left communist left of lenin tendency based on the works of anton pannekoek a dutchgerman left communist
socialism,not_removed,councilism the left communist left of lenin tendency based on the works of anton pannekoek a dutchgerman left communist youre referring to council communism comrade which is a tendency that developed as part of the communist left and supported the ability of the working class to spontaneously organise and overthrow capitalism themselves independent of political parties it is called council communism because at the time workers councils or soviets were the most prominent form of worker organisation during times of revolutionary upheaval councilism is often used to describe a degeneration of this theory that focuses on the form rather than the content of working class revolution they tend to support spontaneous working class organisation regardless of its political content or lack thereof and view worker selforganisation as a substitute for revolution councilists often see worker selforganisation as the end goal whereas council communists see it as a step towards the abolition of the present state of things
socialism,not_removed,how would the actual societies look different though
socialism,not_removed,they wouldnt because ideologies do not create a revolution nor do they dictate what a future society will look like to claim otherwise is pure idealism nobody what exactly how a future communist society will look like anyways predicting that would be like trying to predict the weather decades in advance
socialism,not_removed,different tendencies are mostly concerned with the method to bring about communism not with how communism should be structured
socialism,not_removed,right now we can look at them as strategies or organizational forms to achieve our goal the actual organization of a socialist economy will arise organically it is however imo important to have an outlineto avoid mistakes from the past which may or may not be realized the societies could take the shape of the revolutionary structures but it is hard to say with absolute certainty
socialism,not_removed,keep in mind rojava is based heavily on bookchinöcalan communalism so one of those theories is being out in practice and we can look at it
socialism,not_removed,today just like any other day bash the fash
socialism,not_removed,apparently venezuelan govt has become and dictatorship and right in the comments section theyre demonizing socialists and communists
socialism,not_removed,currently debating with one of my friends who thinks that universal healthcare will create a system where people wont take the risks of their actions that could lead to personal harm into consideration at all i have some ideas about a good retort to it but i was wondering what everyone else would say to that sorta of rhetoric
socialism,not_removed,when the right talks about cultural marxism theyre talking about a fictitious boogeyman specifically a lowkey jewish boogeyman
socialism,not_removed,it kinda says to me that they have no fucking idea what the hell marxism is well i think you kind of answered your own question there comrade im not a marxist but i have read capital and i can say for certain that the people that are most rightwing and the most antimarxist havent where the hell is this happening help me decipher this right wing rhetoric well its happening everywhere comrade in sweden the rightwing populist party the swedish democrats use a lot of similar rhetoric just tuned down a bit its just a part of their fup ideology the jews almost always being the target and ofc some of the lefts largest thinkers have been jewish so it kind of goes hand in hand
socialism,not_removed,can we not use antiwar discussion as a starting point to influence those on the right can we not appeal to their antiwar leanings and then slowly and carefully show them more socialist ideas over time and draw them to our side maybe but id be careful with that antiwar is more of a general attitude prevailing in the usa at the moment but it can change however i think youre right in a certain sense the reason i became an anarchist was because of chomskys antiimperialist writings and although i was already on the farleftmarxist im sure he did something similar for a liberal that he did for me
socialism,not_removed,this is pretty much how i became a communist started out as a high school libertarian who was most passionate about opposing us imperialism figured out that libertarianism doesnt make much sense and became a marxist soon after thanks to an acquaintance exposing me to it
socialism,not_removed,if the only reason you wont harm yourself andor others is because youll have to shell out thousands upon thousands of dollars then there is a bigger problem
socialism,not_removed,ah so i am correct for assuming that it was dogwhistle or coded antijewish talk well yeah but they wouldnt admit it its also less okay to be openly antisemitic in political discourse so they have to use other rhetoric not that it doesnt happen and i have jewish comrades whove told me stories i dont want to repeat but europeweird concept has a history of antisemitism so its less okay these days
socialism,not_removed,what do me by europe weird concept where does europe end and begin basically theres no sea between portugal and china that is to say you could walk so its not a continent europe is a pretty spooky idea because it can mean whatever you want mainly its a cultural concept that excludes and includes people at random if we decipher their code words should we call them out or fuck it because they will hold on meticulously to their deception and duplicity that for me at least is a question of do we first take themfash and nazis seriously to which the answer is yes and no their ideology is a joke so dont even bother debating just make fun of it really but when it comes into powernational parliaments etc it will bring the destruction of so many lives that we have to organise against it secondly it could be worth mentioning that a lot of people that vote for fash or nazi parties arent themselves explicitly converts to fascism or nazism simply people swept up in the winds of reactionary ideology and i would recommend you reach out to those people
socialism,not_removed,one final point on the europe thing a lot of people in sweden mean western europe when they say europe and thats also an issue because those people in the eastern parts arent really europeans to them etc the whole eu debate really sucks tbh the eu is a shitty organisation but most leftwing parties seem to have accepted it so now the only legitimate organised effort against the eu is reactionary as hell i would probably have voted for brexit but i mean its not going to lead to a desirable outcome either way you vote in such a referendum if the country leaves its a victory for nationalism if it stays its a victory for liberalism statusquo bs
socialism,not_removed,good chatting with you likewise
socialism,not_removed,good point but arthur chu is very very very liberal who does not like leftists
socialism,not_removed,old but gold
socialism,not_removed,just to rub it in to the free market fundamentalists
socialism,not_removed,pretty certain he said thatcher was a great feminist figure chu is a clear expression of bourgeoisie activism hes obsessed with issues like representation something which of course is important but clearly cannot understand the roots of these issues
socialism,not_removed,very moist ants
socialism,not_removed,that sketchy timeline notwithstanding leaps and bounds in production techniques and technological innovation predate capitalism they do not however predate labour which in any case extracted the oil milled the steel laid the electrical grid and manufactured the microchips
socialism,not_removed,this post has nothing to do with the valuation of risk in economic terms
socialism,not_removed,there is no financial incentive for workers to be more efficient because they get paid min wage no matter what
socialism,not_removed,no barons no land no land no food what are we serfs to do stop discussing economics and get back to ploughing the field
socialism,not_removed,it absolutely does hiring all the people involved before you turn a profit is absolutely a risk
socialism,not_removed,to those who were wondering what he said no financial incentive means no pioneering inventions to respond to his point rather than this particular comment this is particularly ignorant of the progress in science in all quarters through publiclyfunded science initiatives worldwide as well as in socialist countries such as the ussr and cuba even without the profit incentive of a capitalist system it is human nature to want a better standard of living better health better survival while in a capitalist system profit drives innovation in a socialist system the people drive innovation cuba has pioneered vaccines and healthcare innovations that are even envied by american pharmaceutical giants to the ussrs innovations in space travel perhaps they didnt make it to the moon but they certainly did a lot of work and continued to send satellites and and ships into orbit at an increasing rate after apollo while the us effectively stopped most launches over time even apollo wasnt an effort for profit but rather a feat of human engineering and progress what we learned was put to capitalist use of course but there was no incentive present to make money just the incentive of fulfilling a dead presidents wish to make it to the moon by if the most neoliberal capitalist state on earth can go lets do this for something other than profit there must be some misinformation behind the claim that humans dont do anything if they dont get money in return
socialism,not_removed,okay but that has nothing to do with this post this post never even addresses risk are you commenting in the correct thread
socialism,not_removed,its a risk for the people being hired if anything
socialism,not_removed,it is an equal if not more so of an risk for the workers if the company fails they loose precious cv points
socialism,not_removed,poliovaccinejpg
socialism,not_removed,this post never even addresses risk which is why its ignorant
socialism,not_removed,im just not sure what to say at this point
socialism,not_removed,what about the other thing which supports my worldview
socialism,not_removed,it shows up a bit in settlers by j sakai
socialism,not_removed,it isnt completely about fdr but i thought by john nichols was a great look into an overview of american socialist history
socialism,not_removed,really i havent read it but some of my comrades that i trust called it possibly the worst book on socialism ever written what makes it great also isnt nichols just a mere liberal
socialism,not_removed,i know nichols is an editor for the nation so yes probably a liberalsocial democrat i liked the book because it humanized socialism really well tying it to every major societal advancement showing connections of marx to lincoln showing mjks socialist leanings if i remember right the book talks about fdr lincolnmarx eugene debs susan b anthony mjk thomas paine it pretty much states all those people you like or rights you enjoy had a lot to do with socialists so its more how socialists were involved in us history in other words it wasnt written for socialists i wouldnt say its the best but i think worst is fairly dramatic haha i liked it
socialism,not_removed,theres yuri shaporins opera the decembrists which is about the decembrist uprising and one of russias first revolutionary movements the whole thing is up on youtube if you want to listen just search for the decembrists act i and youll find it
socialism,not_removed,rent isnt explicitly socialist but its tied into the bohemian scene of the late one of the characters is an anarchist theres a whole bunch of normalized lgbt characters and exploration of poverty modern society capitalism and consumerism the aids epidemic one of my favourite musicals and some fantastic social commentary woven in
socialism,not_removed,is a musical film from the cultural revolution thats a dramatization of the chinese revolution
socialism,not_removed,awesome thanks just the sort of thing i was looking for
socialism,not_removed,werent the decembrists just liberals
socialism,not_removed,ive heard such mixed things about it and have kind of been avoiding it for a while thanks for the thoughts on it ill seek it out now
socialism,not_removed,sounds pretty interesting thanks
socialism,not_removed,whats this got to do with socialism
socialism,not_removed,what happened between yesterday and today to bring you here with connolly flair
socialism,not_removed,playing devils advocate for the most part im not too sure where i fall yet in terms of ideology still trying to figure it out
socialism,not_removed,well thats fair enough too if you have questions feel free to ask me here or in pm read the rules though and if a question is slightly suspect on the rules pm me with it
socialism,not_removed,protip dont wed yourself too tightly to a particular strain of socialism all it does is limit your thinking
socialism,not_removed,ive had to remove this as its against reddit rules and could lead to the subreddit being taken down by the admins sorry
socialism,not_removed,nothing more than the logical conclusion of gated communities in my opinion keep me and my people inside the fence keep you and your people outside it the usual latent racism and classism is of course there but thats nothing new
socialism,not_removed,divide and conquer is alive and well often a self promoted and self inflicted divide and conquer strategy within the working class itself is alive and well sighs
socialism,not_removed,thats so sad i got to travel to south america in to uruguay argentina bolivia and brazil and it is full of a lot of passionate people who care about their community and really believed in political possibility for changethere were a lot of people with a love of life even though they didnt have a lot its just tough to see it all turn around on them by a super power in its death throes i guess it makes me we want to work harder to change this shit but its also pretty saddening

socialism,not_removed,the cold war never ended
socialism,not_removed,thanks obama
socialism,not_removed,a full military operation to overthrow a democraticallyelected government is simply too risky nowadays i mean risky of another leak compromising the cia thus dooming the operation because if you were thinking about the risk of it triggering a bloody civil war it exists but they wouldnt mind it given they come out victorious in the end of course its also unlikely to receive popular support in modern days with that in mind the new strategy of the century turkish military take note is to apply a soft parliamentary coup they come up with whatever vague accusation they can against the elected president he once sexually abused someone who wont come forward for fear of retaliation or someone from her party once got bribed so she must be corrupt and then pushed by elitists quasi religious fervor against thecommunist devil have the countrys legislative house impeach the elected president completely ignoring the fact the countrys constitution doesnt allow for impeachment in the specific case even if the unproven allegations were proven true if people get adamant that crimes demand proof the national commotion about purging the government of dishonest people will be so big the populace will buy the idea that the only reason we cant have proof is because the criminals are in power so they cover for each other surely after they are removed proof will naturally surface surely after the coup is done country is liberated from the bandits theyll celebrate never ever remembering something should surface if the memory crosses their mind theyll think ah whatever we already won any way of course this is preceded by a massive and lengthy defamation campaign against the elected leaders in the local media the scale of which would make putins jaw drop this campaign may even involve the target countrys legal system its not so complex for a spy agency the size of the cia to buycoerceplant some lower instances judges to accept multiple complaints against the countrys president it makes no difference that the complaints are completely unsubstantial they are massive fuel for the medias fire that desperately tries to incriminate them people remember they watched the news report in national tv at prime time saying the president had been accused of something terrible but they didnt even read the footnote saying it had been dismissed due to complete lack of evidence one of the objectiveseffects of this campaign is to make sure during the impeachment process when the countrys jurists try to point the obvious problem that the constitution does not allow for an impeachment process to even be started under vague unfounded accusations the population will quickly dismiss the jurists criticism as a technicality are we really gonna miss the opportunity keep in mind elections happen every years of getting rid of these crooked thieves just because of such a trivial detail as the constitution another objective also much like putins campaigns is to polarise the countrys ideological mindset it prevents any possible rational debate about how to come out of the institutional crisis theyre about to throw the country in for instance the only possible explanation for someone trying to defend the countrys democratic institutions will be communist talk as such their arguments can be immediately discarded however rational they may seem even if the common sense evaluates their arguments as unbiased well elaborated and rational its only because the commies learned satans fancy word trickery as they are all devil worshippers this last part of the rationale doesnt even have to be inducted through media campaign as they are already instilled in the back of peopless minds thanks decades of fascist ciabacked dictatorships thats what they did first in paraguay and then in brazil the campaign in argentina was so strong they managed to elect a white house puppet thus avoiding the need of an institutional coup in uruguay however it was so weak they couldnt even trigger the coup process as they never had congressional majority in venezuela its an ongoing process nonetheless maduro seems to be much more pugnacious than lugo and roussef and i wish him good luck i also wish these countries had shown more solidarity towards each other when needed if for instance argentina andor brazil two much larger and more powerful countries than paraguay had sent a special ops team to assunción to defend lugo and protect him at the lópez palace while he dismissed the revolting congress and administered the following crisis a new congressional election could be called after he had time to clear his name and the leftist frente guasú wouldve recovered congressional majority military personal that opposed the democratically elected president would be dismissed and thus a sovereign future for the paraguayan people would be possible also this would strengthen the other leftist governments throughout south america and probably the brazilian coup would not have happened either neither the argentinian coup that they would attempt after they had lost yet another election there unfortunately theres no way we can tell how the discussions went in brasilia and buenos aires during the paraguayan coup im sure they considered intervention but the special ops teams of both these countries are still commanded by cold war era grown fascists they could be bypassed but this fact is at least discouraging also they mightve had intel on some usa black ops acting in paraguay which would mean all hell breaking loose if someone else were to send an opposing team and the outcome unpredictable anyway this exemplifies what is one of the most significant left paradox we can govern fairly and be ousted by a coup or we can govern firmly like fascists would
socialism,not_removed,fuck i cant believe america is pulling this shit today left governments can never be safe from capitalism imperialism or the united states until they all fall
socialism,not_removed,chile socialist yeah no socdem at best
socialism,not_removed,right government installed via ussupported coup detat in brazil even if you admit that there was a coup detat not a soft coup a full blown coup detat there is no evidence to say that it was supported by the us are there any sources
socialism,not_removed,whats leftypol
socialism,not_removed,thisis a misleading map as an example a characteristic of latin american politics is that there are cycles of extremes an extreme right wing president in la right wing protectionism left free trade gets replaced by an extreme left wing president and so on in argentina the cristina kirchner pro restricted trade was president from during which her protectionist economic policies failed to lead to the expected industrialization and hurt a lot of soybean farmers big ag industry in argentina in mauricio macri was elected pro free trade and he is the current president the shift has nothing to do with us intervention edit the reason macri aligns with us interests i guess is because he asked to meet with obama after his election to discuss the possibility of becoming trade partners and renegotiating trade policies
socialism,not_removed,bolivia has imminent elections
socialism,not_removed,a limited region of the world with a rich source of raw material needed by most of the world lithium i couldnt have quessed that the us would have intervened there
socialism,not_removed,leftypol eww
socialism,not_removed,can confirm brazil is becoming more and more libertarian tons of rightwing talking heads pushing this bullshit
socialism,not_removed,id be really interested to see where this info came from and how reliable the alleged bits are
socialism,not_removed,brazil is about to swing back left so hard the most likely next president is lula the next most likely is from their equivalent of the green party the conservative alliance illegitimately in power right now isnt even in the running
socialism,not_removed,brazil was changed democratically on charges of corruption not the same as a coup and it cant be tied to the us someone disprove me with legitimate sources i will believe you if you can
socialism,not_removed,brasil government installed by us yeah no this is bullshit dilma rousseff was incredibly corrupt funneled literally billions of dollars of govt money into private enterprises and got legally impeached partisans want to represent this as a rightversusleft issue but the fact is that the brasilian government was and is a shitshow and was less socialist than just following the roman ideals of bread and circuses when i visited relatives in brasil several of them had antidilma stickers on their cars this was before the impeachement ive seen a number of fora temer temer is dilmas replacement so theyre saying leave temer posts on my facebook hell you can just go to rbrasil and ask them yourself what they think about the impeachement theyre friendly and the vast majority speak english but the tldr is that this map is a hilariously incorrect view of brasil at the very least and that makes me think its also bullshitting on the rest of its data as well
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately having lived in brazil while all this was going on a huge part of it is also corruption a large part of the population has lost faith in the workers party because of corruption despite the fact that of course the right wing parties are equally if not more guilty i know a lot of my left wing friends out there like to think lulas hands are clean but im not convinced the problem is does that invalidate the pt entirely how do you remove corruption in a country as mindblowingly big as brasil that was a rightwing military dictator only years ago its not like all previous moneyed powerful interests just disappear overnight and so how would a political party move to the top without a certain level of corruption i dont know the answer but the problem is palpable the amounts of money that have gone missing are just astronomical and when the economy starts slowing down its hard to keep any form of popular support when people know that money is going missing its a real shame that dilma didnt manage to hang a few more people from the opposition out to dry or even better some sympathetic forces before she was ousted i have a lot of hope for brazil the popular support for the government that took control after the impeachment is barely anything the left just needs to organise itself and provide a viable alternative by october one thing you can say is that despite the recent setback the situation for the brazilian people is still much better than in the and
socialism,not_removed,whats sad is how mindbogglingly effective it is while the us was stirring shit in the middle east and south america putin has succeeded in getting trump and a number of other european parties aligned with russian interests elected it either proves that theres no less corruption in the first world than elsewhere or that the masses are hopelessly gullible to a point where few thousand individuals and few dozen news outlets are enough to completely swing an election around both of which are extremely bad news they mean that democracy in the modern world is essentially dysfunctional
socialism,not_removed,at least lenín moreno will win in ecuador hopefully
socialism,not_removed,it says brasilwirecom
socialism,not_removed,not in south america source am a south american and ive been told to go to cuba for displaying socialist ideas
socialism,not_removed,anyway this exemplifies what is one of the most significant left paradox we can govern fairly and be ousted by a coup or we can govern firmly like fascists would the hundred year old problem
socialism,not_removed,this pretty much sums up what happened in brazil last year
socialism,not_removed,i cant believe it either but this infographic from leftypol says otherwise
socialism,not_removed,yeah i think thats just as much the incompetence and corruption of rouseff than it was any us fuckery
socialism,not_removed,its an board its also the very definition of brocialism
socialism,not_removed,pol but left
socialism,not_removed,youre joking right
socialism,not_removed,it sounds like your family is pretty middleclass theres nothing wrong with that but a lot of not middle class people might have different views on these issues
socialism,not_removed,nope rousseff was impeached by a budget technicality something that would make any developed nation blush the legal argument wasnt even near corruption
socialism,not_removed,i am brazilian and you are ridiculously wrong first rbrasil is rightwing and reactionary af just like everyone in the upper and upper middle classes ask in rbrasildob as see their opinions about it it will change completely second if you would actually read any news you would see that the accusations of corruption for self enrichment were never confirmed in fact people that are symbols of corruption imhere were responsible for her ousting for example the president of the house eduardo cunha was literally arrested for corruption a few weeks after he approved the impeachment fernando collor is a former ousted from power because of corruption and fiscal irresponsability renan calheiros has a veeeery long crime list but all the times he simply paid someone a bribe and escaped still he is the very personification of corruption in brazil and many others maluf aécio neves bolsonaro ronaldo caiado the main argument in the rightwing was economic performance which is not a reason for impeachment in the constitution btw not to mention other interests in her impeachment the ultraconservatism brazil has a strong group of christian fundamentalists apologists of the military regime and lobbyists of the agrarian industry in the congress so although us influence was not proved yet it was a coup and its interests are aligned with those of imperialism obama must have heard the news with joy
socialism,not_removed,poor obama
socialism,not_removed,you seem to know a lot about brazil and im currently writing an essay on the country for my degree could you explain how the us have supported a coup in brazil is it referring to the impeachment of rousseff
socialism,not_removed,ingen støtte for borgerparti arbeiderpartiet er det nye høyre
socialism,not_removed,found the socdem
socialism,not_removed,norway is part of the problem
socialism,not_removed,no such thing as reasonable capitalism thats like saying you have a reasonable rabid dog it may behave for a while but it will turn on you as soon as you let your guard down
socialism,not_removed,lol
socialism,not_removed,just cold for the wealthy
socialism,not_removed,you cant win an election without big money and you cat get big money without compromising dirty hands is the price of rule in a capitalist society they wouldnt have been elected in the first place if they werent corruptible im sure theres a leftist party in your country that doesnt accept bribery from any corporation think about how close they are not to getting the presidency why should a corrupt govt not fall because they simply dont look at the world you live in corruption permeates almost every government with the notable exceptions of the scandinavian countries and japan your country is not special because its corrupt as long as the ruling body keeps protecting international investors interests no woe befalls them you might think that corruption leads to the fall but thats not the case lack of servitude to international capitalists leads to the fall corruption is just the method they use if it was corruption why doesnt any right oriented government fall to it no matter how corrupt they are there are examples in your own country
socialism,not_removed,rousseff i am brazilian and i feel disgusted by this sort of opinions it has been very clear to many that the us was sympathetic to the coup at least also although she did commite serious mistakes never was she accused of corruption and no proof of that whatsoever exist the main argument of the rightwing was economical performance and even though she was incompetent removingnhernwas an obvious violation of the constitution according to the federal constitution of the single only reason to remove a president is if they commit a crime incompetence afaik is no crime
socialism,not_removed,it really is its trying to boil down extremely complex political situations and outcomes to one dimension who was in office in the us its just silly and it takes away agency from people in central and south america and makes it look like everything is out of their hands these countries have lots of systemic problems lots different groups want different things and that relates to the us in different ways
socialism,not_removed,cmon dude you cant be serious citing obama at face value
socialism,not_removed,on their way to becoming stable democracies you mean they have democratized the economy and seized the means of production because otherwise your definition of stable democracy is pretty shallow though i will admit its what most people believe constitutes as democracy but because most people believe it that doesnt make it right capitalist propaganda is still a thing
socialism,not_removed,someone really should point you the way to rliberals or something like that
socialism,not_removed,kirchner was a disaster in argentina her whole administration was all posturing cutting the country off from the international community and she plunged the value of the peso macri may be right of center but at least hes sane its a relief to see the democratic process still works in argentina cristinas government got peoples salaries above the inflation macris government hasnt macris government is literally sending the police into schools to ask which teachers are striking they are doing so because his government is denying paritarias and they are giving them an under inflation salary increase which almost never happened with cristina if i recall correctly this along with massive firings of workers around the country flexible labor policies a neoliberal praxis in all parts of his gabinet is not something a socialist would approve
socialism,not_removed,is it still banworthy to be affiliated with leftypol or have we gone through a period of glasnost im surprised this post is still up
socialism,not_removed,isnt best known as where gamergate fled to after kicked it out
socialism,not_removed,tends to be more racist if anything the fundamental noncultural difference is that does usercreated boards like reddit
socialism,not_removed,is a mix of and reddit it has a similar format but anyone can start their own board
socialism,not_removed,is far far worse yet i love its format as an imageboard with usercreated boards wish it wasnt so reactionary
socialism,not_removed,nah i didnt know of a lefty pol
socialism,not_removed,temer was an informant for the us embassy in brazil what other links did he have with us intelligence
socialism,not_removed,obviously its not universally true but its like what class of brazilians are most likely to speak english and the time to spend on forums oh those who can afford a private education and often the only time they ever even meet someone from the working class is the person stacking the shelves at the expensive supermarket im not saying that invalidates the opinions of those from brazil posting on sites like reddit but you have to be aware youre getting a systematically warped view of the population
socialism,not_removed,and yet they have universal healthcare backed by a constitutional declaration that healthcare is a right
socialism,not_removed,i agree with most if what you are saying im just wondering how much the united states was actually involved in her impeachment
socialism,not_removed,exactly just because us influence is becoming less and less important in south america doesnt mean the internal bourgeoisie arent still incredibly powerful the class structures in latin america are deeply entrenched and strong they go back further than usa dominance and will extend past it
socialism,not_removed,on their way things dont happen overnight i dont think its fair to jump on someone for praising things like agrarian reform public education the ability to protest in public and public utilities extended to shanty towns as making up a part of moving in a direction of stable democracy regardless of what your view of what a democratic end goal would actually look like otherwise you just get to the point of well germany is still a nation state so how is it really any better than in the comparing latin america now to latin america years ago is fucking night and day or at least night and twilight
socialism,not_removed,no liberals are those who think that because the pt has worker in the title its in anyway socialist liberals are those who think politics exists in the swings of the twoparty system which is apparently everyone on this thread the pt was the ruling party for years keeping organised labour as mere lackeys to their corporatism
socialism,not_removed,only if that means focusing on class to the point of excluding fundamental components of the class struggle such as feminism nobody here begrudges people for talking class unless that entails being explicitly reductionist and exclusionary towards the more marginalized and downtrodden sections of the proletariat if your socialism does not include the struggles of the most oppressed parts of the working class hint the global working class is generally nonwhite and nonmale then its not only untenable but decidedly not socialism if so please tell me so i can ban you
socialism,not_removed,dont forget harbouring child porn thats an important part of
socialism,not_removed,like very reactionary leftism
socialism,not_removed,budget fiscal technicalities were used as decoy not only it was described in a very obscure law which is never observedher enemies did literally the same thing the law itsef is subject to different interpretations and the one used in the impeahment is a controversial one i know about my country but you can even see through obvious propaganda
socialism,not_removed,phew i thought id misunderstood something massively in my reading the levels of corruption in brazil are really shocking i dont understand how so much money can just go missing can you tell me a little about rousseffs time in government how was she as a president and how do her policies differ to temers
socialism,not_removed,remember the impeachment wasnt because of the coruption but pedaladas fiscais
socialism,not_removed,and privatised social security which the us doesnt have comparing to the us is kind of a shitty measure the left governments in chile have been responsible for selling off the country to neoliberal corporations
socialism,not_removed,i already answered your other comment
socialism,not_removed,indeed pt is not socialist the opinions voiced by the comment above however arent socialist as well his whole way of thinking stinks to liberalism and mild imperialism apologism
socialism,not_removed,why does it matter what marx would have thought why not evaluate ideas based on their individual validity instead of deciding that everything your prophets say is gospel truth this is the problem with the authoritarian mindset they decide that there are these great minds whose work we need to study so we can capture a bit of their greatness in reality marx was just a studious guy who became associated with a huge collection of socialist ideas most of which originated decades or even centuries before he came along plenty of his thoughts are ignorant and misguided and theres nothing useful about treating capital like the bible
socialism,not_removed,we cant be too picky with allies watch me
socialism,not_removed,had a skype chat with a long time user a few months back i was told by him that an overwhelming majority of anons do support all the aforementioned class struggles but the fairly libertarian moderation of the board attracts just about every every political affiliation and massive circlejerks and sectarian wars inevitably erupt the site is also raided daily by pol which only worsens the situation i was also told that that an overwhelming majority of users there believe that the economic commodifying of the gender and race equality movements such as blm will bring down the aforementioned movements and that they should turn to a socialist platform instead of a neoliberal i do not use the site myself therefore i cant verify anything written here but if he was honest then leftypol is pretty woke
socialism,not_removed,ah
socialism,not_removed,yet i love its format as an imageboard with usercreated boards wish it wasnt so reactionary reactionary in terms of what
socialism,not_removed,and remember the impeachment occurred right after a special commission found that those pedaladas hadnt happened and one day before the congress that impeached her made the pedaladas legal
socialism,not_removed,no doubt just giving another point of reference for the comparison one that is pretty shameful to the us imo
socialism,not_removed,i took it as liberalism of the bullshit kind andor brocialism
socialism,not_removed,we would be better only with a socialist revolution
socialism,not_removed,what a shit revolution youre gonna have if youre willing to sell anyone who isnt a white stembro down the river for it
socialism,not_removed,we are in rsocialism dude gtfo if you are against it nós estamos numa sub socialista velho sai daqui
socialism,not_removed,automation in a capitalist society no more than what we have now maybe less youre probably aware of that tons and tons of food are thrown away every year by big corporations automation in a socialist society yes obviously if a product is made mostly by machines and someone wants to produce that product it should be okay
socialism,not_removed,yes labor automation does two things it lessens the burden on the workers but if in a capitalist framework it will agitate the workers hopefully to communism
socialism,not_removed,in a capitalist society it just replaces the workers with further means of production which are owned by the capitalists so its obviously bad for the working class in a postrevolution society all work that can be automated should be theres no reason for someone to be working a job a robot could do
socialism,not_removed,your first paragraph seems to contradict your second you seem to say that the implementation of new technology improves the quality of life of everyone then go on to say that within this context it actually causes increased concentrations of wealth and displacement of labor
socialism,not_removed,unless they want to obviously i hope thats what you meant
socialism,not_removed,yes it does both simultaneously it vastly reduces the cost of consumer goods thus making it affordable to a larger segment of the population furniture and automobiles for instance and as those people consume the capitalist retains the wealth and does not reinvest that capital back into the working class who produced those affordable goods thus the funneling of the wealth with the simultaneous improvement in the quality of living but honestly we shouldnt view this issue exclusively within the capitalist framework within a socialist economy automation is something that we should strive to implement in every facet of society
socialism,not_removed,i suppose though im not sure why
socialism,not_removed,thus the funneling of the wealth with the simultaneous improvement in the quality of living but how does the quality of my life improve as a worker who no longer sees the reinvestment of capital the price of goods is rather irrelevant when i have no means to meet any price at all within a socialist economy automation is something that we should strive to implement in every facet of society sure but the capitalist framework is the framework were currently in you say you understand the logic then it should be pretty apparent that the logic is as follows under capitalism automation does not produce increases in the quality of life for all in fact it can often produce extremely detrimental effects not to mention that increases to the rate of fixed capital to variable capital cause the inherentsystemic chaos and failures of capitalism at large which in case you havent noticed plunge most of the working class into increasingly desperate conditions
socialism,not_removed,if say i love creating car parts and consider it an expression of my being and i find out that i am not allowed to do that because the towns industry of car parts is entirely automatized that would make me feel awful
socialism,not_removed,but how does the quality of my life improve as a worker who no longer sees the reinvestment of capital the price of goods is rather irrelevant when i have no means to meet any price at all it is by prevailing standards a very basic and unjust improvement in the standard of living this shouldnt be interpreted as a resounding improvement in the standard of living to something more egalitarian but a long over due and very modest improvement because the cost has been reduced so dramatically like that crankpowered laptop but of course these improvements vary dramatically based on the region and socioeconomic class in question like how the middle class in the united states could suddenly afford automobiles following the implementation of assembly line manufacturing or could afford personal computers with the mass production of microprocessors under capitalism automation does not produce increases in the quality of life for all in fact it can often produce extremely detrimental effects not to mention that increases to the rate of fixed capital to variable capital cause the inherentsystemic chaos and failures of capitalism at large which in case you havent noticed plunge most of the working class into increasingly desperate conditions well it reduces the cost of manufacturing goods it also establishes a consistency in the quality of the goods it manufactures humans are far more susceptible to mistakes than ai it also vastly increases the quantity of goods manufactured a fully automated factory could operate but could you explain how its detrimental if were going to assume that the owners are going to retain the wealth which they save as they have so far then yes obviously its criminal but i have no reason to make such an assumption i attribute this thievery merely to the passive nature of the population if we would demand taxation to counteract the displacementat a sufficient enough scale throughout the economy we would inevitably question the logic of retaining private ownership entirely and could transition immediately to a communist economy i dont understand what youre saying about the rate of fixed capital
socialism,not_removed,there might be some conflict there why should the car manufactory be slowed down just because you like making car parts by hand if you like to do it as a hobby why not but one person cant overrule the majority who would probably rather not spend all day doing menial labor in a factory
socialism,not_removed,think of it as the most destitute people in the world suddenly affording clean water because through the implementation of whatever technology the community has access to portable water purifiers of course this can happen what you seem to be overlooking still is that it is completely within the real of political discourse as to whether or not it does or does not improve the quality of lives for people in this particular case it may be through some form of charity either by producer or by those willing to purchase on behalf of consumers certainly the mere improvement of technology does not afford these people the capacity to produce it themselves nor does it afford them necessarily the ability to purchase it without someone deciding that despite a limited profit margin and market they are willing to invest there rather than in say apple stock to produce the next igadget but of course these improvements vary dramatically based on the region and socioeconomic class in question they are a purely political question the mere improvement of technology under capitalism does not afford anyone anything without those who control the productive forces allowing it to do so like how the middle class in the united states could suddenly afford automobiles following the implementation of assembly line manufacturing increases to the division of labor are hardly technological advancement that said im not debating the capacity for technological improvement and automation to improve the quality of lives what im arguing against is the blanket notion that it does period whether or not it does so within the current context is not under our control or the control of those who might benefit in any meaningful sense but could you explain how its detrimental in the current context sure to name a few increased machine energy and natural resource consumption consumption leading to pollution and the destruction of the planet laying off of workers in entire industries who even if they get new jobs are often more menial and afford them less pay further concentration in the disbursement of fixed capital its easier to centralize machines than humans leading to increased regional disparities in wealth concentration of political power to those states which benefit from the disparate disbursement i dont understand what youre saying about the rate of fixed capital the general rate of profit in marxist economics is determined by the following equation svcv increase c fixed capital decrease v variable capital which amounts to a proportionate decrease for both numerator and denominator and what do you get larger denominator therefore reduced rate of profit decline in the rate of profit can be linked to and correlated with nearly every major depression and recession for as long as weve had requisite data to get an idea of it in short when capitalists dont see profits return investment ceases layoffs are incurred even beyond that of laying off those replaced by machines and stock values like to plummet
socialism,not_removed,that person isnt bothering anyone with automation big corporations throw away tons and tons of food every year the difference that one or many person makes doesnt matter at all remember than in socialism every job you do unless its because its an urgent demand by society eg shortage is hobby or leisure in some way you are not working entirely for a wage
socialism,not_removed,of course this can happen what you seem to be overlooking still is that it is completely within the real of political discourse as to whether or not it does or does not improve the quality of lives for people in this particular case it may be through some form of charity either by producer or by those willing to purchase on behalf of consumers certainly the mere improvement of technology does not afford these people the capacity to produce it themselves nor does it afford them necessarily the ability to purchase it without someone deciding that despite a limited profit margin and market they are willing to invest there rather than in say apple stock to produce the next igadget let me express it this way if an individual has a single penny to his name then it is safe to assume that a capitalist would want to claim that penny for himself so if that capitalist can sell to an individual a good that costs less than a penny to manufacture then by all means he will do it to a far less dramatic extent what makes that possible is the implementation of technology including automation which has reduced the cost of a large swath of consumer goods very dramatically over the years i would concede to you though that to this day a large segment of the worlds most destitute population has yet to experience much of the material conveniences that technology has afforded to the rest of us this does little to change the core of my argument though which is that through the continued advance of technology it becomes less and less expensive and labor intensive to manufacture goods and this translates to a continued drop in the cost of these goods rendering them affordable to an ever increasing segment of the population this does not mean that the most poor people in the world will one day afford a new iphone they are a purely political question the mere improvement of technology under capitalism does not afford anyone anything without those who control the productive forces allowing it to do so i wouldnt disagree with you that the prices of goods are set arbitrarily and are far more accurate representations of what the target market can afford than a just and reasonable price for the product in question this is why we see clothes indistinguishable from rags sold to young elitist markets for obscene sums of money but all this means is that the cost of manufacturing and shipping those goods has only to pass a certain point before it becomes affordable for a population and viable for the business to sell the products there i understand that for this to be feasible in the most deprived regions of the world the cost would have to be a ridiculously low figure increases to the division of labor are hardly technological advancement that said im not debating the capacity for technological improvement and automation to improve the quality of lives what im arguing against is the blanket notion that it does period whether or not it does so within the current context is not under our control or the control of those who might benefit in any meaningful sense but i never said that all technology improves the quality of life of everyone equally that would be an absurd claim what im saying is that automation among other technologies make products which would otherwise have been too expensive affordable to a larger segment of the population in the current context sure to name a few increased machine energy and natural resource consumption consumption leading to pollution and the destruction of the planet laying off of workers in entire industries who even if they get new jobs are often more menial and afford them less pay further concentration in the disbursement of fixed capital its easier to centralize machines than humans leading to increased regional disparities in wealth concentration of political power to those states which benefit from the disparate disbursement absolutely none of that is a given the use of resources and energy is proportional to the goods manufactured if anything automation through its efficiency and reduced susceptibility to error would reduce waste i do not believe that the laying off of workers is an inherently unfavorable situation this is a natural byproduct of our technological evolution what we need to do is support these people once they have been laid off thus extremely high taxation and an ever increasing bui the regional concentration of wealth is a legitimate issue for which i cannot think of any solution within this economic and political structure that only further reinforces the need to advance past this capitaliststate structure decline in the rate of profit can be linked to and correlated with nearly every major depression and recession for as long as weve had requisite data to get an idea of it in short when capitalists dont see profits return investment ceases layoffs are incurred even beyond that of laying off those replaced by machines and stock values like to plummet fair enough but i should emphasize now if i havent done so adequately enough yet the importance of taxation and the bui for this to be a feasible approach by absolutely no means do i believe that we can automate labor in this economy without then supporting the people financially this would be ridiculous
socialism,not_removed,sure i guess he could work there why not maybe in a postscarcity and fully automated society that would be true but it seems a bit fantastic for the coal miners garbage collectors and sewer cleaners to do their jobs just for fun
socialism,not_removed,if an individual has a single penny to his name then it is safe to assume that a capitalist would want to claim that penny for himself i dont think thats a safe assumption at all not all and id wager very few capitalists are greedy simply for the sake of being greedy this is not a personalindividual problem with capitalists its a systemic problem so if that capitalist can sell to an individual a good that costs less than a penny to manufacture then by all means he will do it the sale of the good is not the operative issue at hand it is the production of the good obviously if someone happens to have a good and someone happens to have the requisite money to acquire the good the capitalist will sell it to that person the question however is whether or not a capitalist is going to invest in the production of a good for which there currently is not one and at what cost they will sell it particularly in monopoly conditions which at bottom will be relative to their cost of production whether or not they will invest in production carries with it a whole lot of questions what are the long term profits involved are there more profitable industries that require less startup whats the overall demand for the product not just this single individual demand which is that through the continued advance of technology it becomes less and less expensive and labor intensive to manufacture goods and this translates to a continued drop in the cost of these goods cost of production of those goods whether or not that affords an actual drop in the cost of the good depends on many more variables but sure there is a general tendency assuming nonmonopolistic conditions and a market with fair demand that fixed capital investment particularly in more efficient technology will push the cost of goods down im not debating this but whether or not this makes them more accessible is dependent on the other side of that equation i wouldnt disagree with you that the prices of goods are set arbitrarily and are far more accurate representations of what the target market can afford than a just and reasonable price for the product in question thats not my claim and i would disagree with that prices are not set arbitrarily prices reflect real and objective market forces including cost of production supply and demand etc while the exact price to the penny may be somewhat arbitrary that is not really what is of concern this is why we see clothes indistinguishable from rags sold to young elitist markets for obscene sums of money but this is not arbitrary even if appears that way to you because you cannot justify the cost but all this means is that the cost of manufacturing and shipping those goods has only to pass a certain point before it becomes affordable for a population and viable for the business to sell the products there you seem to be stuck on price which is not in particular what im talking about when i say that this is a political question what i am saying is that even the capacity to produce far before a price is determined is a question that is solely in the hands of the capitalists that is the decision to make a product at all is not automatic the capitalist does not simply produce every possible thing that they can regardless of margins markets or requisite investment they dont produce for the sake of production they produce for the sake of exchange therefore the decision to produce is defined by the parameters of exchange but i never said that all technology improves the quality of life of everyone equally i didnt say you said this what you said was under no basis should we oppose the natural advance of technology and its implementation in society as this improves the quality of life of everyone particularly the most disadvantaged all i have said is no it does not improve the quality of life of everyone within the current context and whether or not it does improve the lives of everyone is a political question not an economic one what im saying is that automation among other technologies make products which would otherwise have been too expensive affordable to a larger segment of the population so does taking money from the poorest people who cant afford those products anyhow and giving it to people in the middle who given that extra can but this clearly does not improve the lives of everyone the poorest people are demonstrably worse off despite that the products can now be afforded by a larger segment of the population absolutely none of that is a given well very few things are a given my position would be that they are as given perhaps moreso than that it imrpoves the lives of everyone at least in the current politicaleconomy the use of resources and energy is proportional to the goods manufactured if anything automation through its efficiency and reduced susceptibility to error would reduce waste precisely where do you think the tools of automation come from thin air there are new goods being manufactured the means of automation which require their own resources their own productive forces their own energy etc humans of course require all of these things too but their energy source does not require entire shifts in existing infrastructure to be essentially carbon neutral nor does their reproductive forces other humans consume limited raw materials etc i do not believe that the laying off of workers is an inherently unfavorable situation no its not inherently nothing ive said has been inherent i have consistently and repeatedly pointed out that i am talking about within the current politicaleconomic context literally my first point in this discussion was that their logic is bound by the existing context something you yourself noted in contradiction to yourself of course automation is a path to liberation under socialism automation under capitalism however is something very different and thats why you find people opposed to it thus extremely high taxation and an ever increasing bui but this just says that we change the system you concluded your op by saying if anything we must demand greater investment in the sciences and engineering as this places a greater burden on the state and further aggravates the rampant economic injustices of our times this is basically an argument for accelerationism a theory which i dont subscribe to politically or economically what we must demand is and has been the same thing for quite some time you will not force capitalist to see the light by making things continuously worse and as far as how workers will react that is completely dependent on having the political groundwork laid to begin with that is if you force the worst possible circumstances in an expectation that the capitalist controlled state will concede something like bui you must ensure that the requisite political consciousness exists to guide that demand otherwise as populations have proven historically we are as liable to turn toward rightwing extremism as we are to turn towards a left revolutionary paradigm in fact were more likely to do so since the right generally speaking is already in positions of cultural power that only further reinforces the need to advance past this capitaliststate structure if you accelerate material conditions without the appropriate political conditions you are in for a world of hurt youre basically rolling some dice at that point the importance of taxation and the bui for this to be a feasible approach this only further reduces the rate of profit and causes even more instability literally what is good for capitalism is bad for workers as such what is good for workers is bad for capitalism you cant resolve the contradiction by making the system fairer there is no feasible approach to reforming capitalism by absolutely no means do i believe that we can automate labor in this economy without then supporting the people financially and we cant support the people financially without changing the politicaleconomy therefore if were going to automate labor and be humane we must abolish the existing politicaleconomic system hence where the opposition to automation comes from we havent abolished that system therefore automation is at odds with a humane civilization
socialism,not_removed,yeah not a lot of people on that boat
socialism,not_removed,i dont think thats a safe assumption at all not all and id wager very few capitalists are greedy simply for the sake of being greedy this is not a personalindividual problem with capitalists its a systemic problem i was speaking hypothetically i never implied that it was a personal problem the question however is whether or not a capitalist is going to invest in the production of a good for which there currently is not one and at what cost they will sell it particularly in monopoly conditions which at bottom will be relative to their cost of production whether or not they will invest in production carries with it a whole lot of questions what are the long term profits involved are there more profitable industries that require less startup whats the overall demand for the product not just this single individual demand yes and what im saying is that with the introduction of technology the cost of production is reduced leading to a reduction in the price of the product and so a greater number of people can afford the product but whether or not this makes them more accessible is dependent on the other side of that equation what is it dependent upon you seem to be stuck on price which is not in particular what im talking about when i say that this is a political question what i am saying is that even the capacity to produce far before a price is determined is a question that is solely in the hands of the capitalists that is the decision to make a product at all is not automatic the capitalist does not simply produce every possible thing that they can regardless of margins markets or requisite investment they dont produce for the sake of production they produce for the sake of exchange therefore the decision to produce is defined by the parameters of exchange define exchange i didnt say you said this what you said was under no basis should we oppose the natural advance of technology and its implementation in society as this improves the quality of life of everyone particularly the most disadvantaged all i have said is no it does not improve the quality of life of everyone within the current context and whether or not it does improve the lives of everyone is a political question not an economic one if the conflict here stems from the word everyone then forgive me for the absolutist statement but even in that context technology has rendered feasible at least help from nonprofit charitable organizations explain how this is a political issue so does taking money from the poorest people who cant afford those products anyhow and giving it to people in the middle who given that extra can but this clearly does not improve the lives of everyone the poorest people are demonstrably worse off despite that the products can now be afforded by a larger segment of the population so the individuals who are unemployed and therefore have no money would not find any benefit from the technology thats a given unless there is a bui as i have mentioned but regardless of the economy in question an unemployed individual with no money is not going to reap the benefits of technological advancement its a pointless observation our medium of exchange is money unless we intend to furnish commodities for free but then that requires taxation returning to the point i made about raising taxes extraordinarily high for those who are automating precisely where do you think the tools of automation come from thin air there are new goods being manufactured the means of automation which require their own resources their own productive forces their own energy etc humans of course require all of these things too but their energy source does not require entire shifts in existing infrastructure to be essentially carbon neutral nor does their reproductive forces other humans consume limited raw materials etc so your argument is that robotics is too resource intensive therefore we should rely on human labor frankly i have two problems with this one im not convinced that robotics is that devastating to the environment and two the benefits of robotics vastly outweighs the cons for the reasons that ive already mentioned the liberation of the worker and the vastly greater efficiency and reliability of the robots there are many things we should consider not manufacturing to preserve the environment robotics is not one of them no its not inherently nothing ive said has been inherent i have consistently and repeatedly pointed out that i am talking about within the current politicaleconomic context literally my first point in this discussion was that their logic is bound by the existing context something you yourself noted in contradiction to yourself of course automation is a path to liberation under socialism automation under capitalism however is something very different and thats why you find people opposed to it i was talking about the current economic and political system but this just says that we change the system no it doesnt high taxation and social welfare programs do not demonstrate a change in the economic system what we must demand is and has been the same thing for quite some time you will not force capitalist to see the light by making things continuously worse and as far as how workers will react that is completely dependent on having the political groundwork laid to begin with that is if you force the worst possible circumstances in an expectation that the capitalist controlled state will concede something like bui you must ensure that the requisite political consciousness exists to guide that demand otherwise as populations have proven historically we are as liable to turn toward rightwing extremism as we are to turn towards a left revolutionary paradigm in fact were more likely to do so since the right generally speaking is already in positions of cultural power fair enough i agree the government could compromise on one hand thereby further increasing the peoples reliance on government aid and thus diminishing political volatilityor on the other hand the government could remain callous and toss the people to the sidelines with rampant unemployment and poverty leaving them ripe for the picking for whichever political denomination appeals to their given sentiments this only further reduces the rate of profit and causes even more instability literally what is good for capitalism is bad for workers as such what is good for workers is bad for capitalism you cant resolve the contradiction by making the system fairer there is no feasible approach to reforming capitalism how do reduced corporate profits lead to increased instability it isnt my desire for us to reform capitalism this is merely what i believe will be the transitionary phase between capitalism and communism and we cant support the people financially without changing the politicaleconomy i dont think so the limiting factor here is public consciousness and political activity i believe we could implement welfare programs to buffer the consequences of automation therefore if were going to automate labor and be humane we must abolish the existing politicaleconomic system hence where the opposition to automation comes from we havent abolished that system therefore automation is at odds with a humane civilization ideally yes that is what i would like i certainly dont believe thats going to happen but i am very confident that extensive automation is an inevitability in this economy
socialism,not_removed,great snippet thanks for sharing i love ep thompson but really need to brush up on my hobsbawm
socialism,not_removed,reasonable response the london riots were sparked by a guy in tottenham being shot by the police
socialism,not_removed,the family of the victim only years old by the way are now saying that the bike he was riding was his own it wasnt stolen so the cops seem to be blatantly lying in an attempt to justify the murder and the media have been eating it up most of them are reporting the riot and the property damage without saying anything about the murder the murderer has so far only been charged with manslaughter
socialism,not_removed,the reaction by racists doesnt surprise me western australia is probably one of the most racist parts of australia i have lived here for a while and honestly nothing has changed there was even an uproar because the australia day fireworks in fremantle were cancelled
socialism,not_removed,the rworldnews comments are fucking awful
socialism,not_removed,interesting that theyve got a protest sign saying all lives matter or is that a group of reactionaries
socialism,not_removed,australian government to white people were sorry about the whole stolen generations thing australian government to actual indigenous people were not sorry
socialism,not_removed,sometimes im disgusted about the country i live in
socialism,not_removed,when i went backpacking in australia i was appalled at the unapologetic racism that exist
socialism,not_removed,thats really messed up that the media is automatically on the side of the white dudepolice where did you read that the motorbike wasnt stolen
socialism,not_removed,to be absolutely fair that life was probably going to be a net drain on society while the bike at least served some purpose when you remove emotion from it the valuation is pretty accurate
socialism,not_removed,the guy who said the punishment for stealing is not death is being heavily downvoted wtf
socialism,not_removed,i looked i feel unclean i challenged for my sake not theirs
socialism,not_removed,no its just people who are not familiar at all with the debates that go on in the us around blm nothing like black lives matter exists here except a small group of middleclass university students and small business owners who wax lyrical about blackowned business and love the cops obviously without any understanding of the real black lives matter movement at all they seem to only exist in perth so far and have had one decently sized yet politically horrible rally far to the right of anything coming out of the blm movement in the us they are extremely islamophobic and despise the left black lives matter is a slogan that has been taken up by the left and aboriginal activists but besides that it doesnt have any organisational form or social weight like it does in the us
socialism,not_removed,its them
socialism,not_removed,thats vastly inaccurate mate australian government to aboriginal children stolen from their homes and forced to assimilate with white families sorry bout the stolen generations i wouldnt call them white people because they were forced into those families that being said there has been no real support for the aboriginal people in the territories and its frankly quite disgusting
socialism,not_removed,and does stealing a bike deserve a death sentence either way the family has proved conclusively that he never stole any bike he was riding his own bike when he was driven off the road unsurprising that the cops in kalgoorlie who are notorious for corruption and violence would fabricate evidence in an attempt to cover up a racist vigilante attack
socialism,not_removed,you forgot the s
socialism,not_removed,the australian state is the most racist in the world particularly in western australia aboriginal people in australia are the most incarcerated minority in the world our government incarcerates aboriginal children deprives them of food places antispit masks on them even gases them we also have an immigration system that is the envy of white supremacists the world over locking up refugees indefinitely in tropical gulags both major parties labor and liberal support these policies too
socialism,not_removed,the newspaper of note among the centerright published an editorial cartoon that was basically a minstrel show
socialism,not_removed,yea i used to always think americans were the most blatantly racist white people then i went to australia
socialism,not_removed,the family is reporting it
socialism,not_removed,that is fucking revolting do they not even have a basic sense of decency
socialism,not_removed,if he doesnt work then he has no value yay capitalism
socialism,not_removed,man im starting to think reddit needs some sort of hate speech policy i hate to say it downvote me i guess fucking christ
socialism,not_removed,bah this shit just makes my depression worse
socialism,not_removed,the ironic part is that these are the same people who constantly call muslims savages and uncivilized when even under sharia the penalty for theft is just a hand and not death
socialism,not_removed,i think you misunderstand my point im saying that while their has been an official apology for the stolen generations it only means anything for white people from european backgrounds it means nothing to the tens of thousands of indigenous people wronged by it when the government continues similar injustices to this day
socialism,not_removed,the family has proved conclusively that he never stole any bike is that in a different article i dont see it here
socialism,not_removed,theres definitely a bunch of horrible detention centers for refugees prisons in the usa as well took a college class on it terrible stuff i imagine its just as bad in both places here we mostly lock up the victims of violence from mexico and central america who gets locked up in australia
socialism,not_removed,yeah somehow australia manages to be worse to its native population than even canada
socialism,not_removed,thats fucked up i knew australia was bad but this is some israel or apartheid level shit can you give some sources on it i want to bring this up in my local socialist club
socialism,not_removed,i still say the middle east is worse
socialism,not_removed,i never imagined that australia was like that i knew there was racism but didnt know it was on that scale i always thought it was similar to living in the south since cultures seemed relatively similar im really going to have to look more into this
socialism,not_removed,im having trouble finding the source on that do you have a link everything ive seen seems to point to the bike being stolen including a statement from the childs grandfather not that it matters of course the whole thing is still atrocious
socialism,not_removed,not when it comes to unpeople which is whoever the state wants to repress or eliminate at a given time
socialism,not_removed,you must be unfamiliar with the people in rworldnews
socialism,not_removed,revolution cant come soon enough
socialism,not_removed,soon enough values will change and people who make comments like that wont like where their lives end up on the scale
socialism,not_removed,technically rworldnews has a rule about hatespeech but its just there for show nothing is ever done
socialism,not_removed,this isnt even consequentialism done right
socialism,not_removed,rejoice in the riot comrade
socialism,not_removed,ohh i understand your point now my bad for being inflammatory
socialism,not_removed,the family are saying it on social media you wont find it in any mainstream media articles about the case because the cops obviously dont want people to know about it
socialism,not_removed,so you are claiming that the family is lying what the fuck is wrong with you their son just died why would they lie the guy got a manslaughter charge for something that was clearly murder how is driving a off the road with a car at high speed not befitting a murder charge he would have known full and well that doing that could have caused him to die
socialism,not_removed,if i remember correctly its people coming by boat from places like thailand and myanmar rohingya people a muslim minority who are being viciously persecuted by the buddhist majority in the region
socialism,not_removed,oh i can bet ours australias are worse reports of detainees being raped are so common recently a woman was disallowed from travelling to australia from one of our offshore detention centres after being raped to get an abortion because it would empower the people smugglers
socialism,not_removed,dont worry canada is still a close second
socialism,not_removed,the from the abc our bbc equivalent on the nt juvenile justice system is harrowing and indepth on the fucked up way we treat aboriginal kids the guardian are a good guide to the conditions in our clientstate gulags
socialism,not_removed,if by middle easy you mean isis youre probably right but im hesitant to say that the whole region is that bad
socialism,not_removed,i wouldnt say that most australians are as bad as the south most people hold pretty progressive views our racism is often very institutional and not reflective of peoples opinions people in isolated rural areas do have a reputation for being nutjobs though
socialism,not_removed,the mods tried it once and reddit shat its pants about muh amendment
socialism,not_removed,youre alright mate
socialism,not_removed,youre arguing with a troll
socialism,not_removed,a statement made by a family is not conclusive evidence please dont treat it as such
socialism,not_removed,yup whenever the topic comes up i show them this macleans article macleans being one of our most centrist publications httpwwwmacleanscanewscanadawelcometowinnipegwherecanadasracismproblemisatitsworst especially this they came in the wake of a civic election dominated by race relations after a racist rant by a frontrunners wife went viral im really tired of getting harassed by the drunken native guys downtown gord steevess wife lori wrote on facebook we all donate enough money to keep their sorry asses on welfare so shut the f–k up and dont ask me for another handout the former city councillor and longserving centrist politician didnt bother apologizing
socialism,not_removed,iirc of the native population is impoverished
socialism,not_removed,heres just one example and while winnipeg is worse than usual its not too uncommon httpwwwmacleanscanewscanadawelcometowinnipegwherecanadasracismproblemisatitsworst theres also the over representation of aboriginals in the prison system and police targeting as well as the residual impacts of the residential schools which didnt close completely until and only closed in the majority in the
socialism,not_removed,last i checked muh amendment only protects you against the government reddit mods can kick whoever they want from their subs
socialism,not_removed,to be fair to the government of canada yes stephen harper was not good for relations with the aboriginal communities however i think trudeau has the power to turn the tide relations with aboriginal communities will never be super great though there will always be bitterness and resentment at the government of canada and european religious institutions
socialism,not_removed,also the whole eugenics program against them in the
socialism,not_removed,like redditors care about facts
socialism,not_removed,i think itll help a bit but the fundamental capitalist nature of the canadian state will still disadvantage aboriginals for a long time poverty is generational after all
socialism,not_removed,no trudeau firmly represents the interests of the capitalist class while he plays a leftpopulist role in trying to curry favour with progressive social movements
socialism,not_removed,i hear that
socialism,not_removed,tell me something how does one make money you know ill be the first to confess to being a hypocrite to blasting capitalism while still owning a iphone a custom built pc a ford comfortable furniture mass produced clothes manufactured in a vietnam sweatshoplife in the western world comes with compromises if you truly support socialist ideals be prepared to give up luxuries such as the ones stated abovebecause to be fair it is in a capitalist system that we have these comforts sorry but that is the way it is justin trudeau realizes this and he has to pick his battles we need electricitywhere do we get it from hydroelectricity is one of the cleanest we have and most viable ontario is one the best examples of the fight over affordable electricity and future energy demands
socialism,not_removed,id say yes freedom of speech press and religion is enshrined in the first amendment but it wasnt taken seriously until the early to mid century up until then there were many laws that blatantly infringed upon these freedoms mormonism was banned in entire states in the the alien and sedition act of made it illegal to criticize the government it was repealed a couple years later though and most infamously the comstock laws made it illegal to publish information about or discussion of birth control abortion and free love and send this material through the us post office the early feminist movement the nonreactionary segment at least struggled against these victorian laws indeed the fight for womens suffrage in the us and uk involved literal brawls with the police and hunger strikes as well the iww used to be arrested for no reason when they tried to organize workers or even just sell newspapers and spread their message on the streets via speeches and they won some of the very first lawsuits on first amendment grounds they also utilized direct action getting themselves arrested en masse until city jails were full and costing a fortune this often forced cities to change their laws without requiring a court case the mass antiracist civil rights movement and antiwar movement of the and also helped establish norms around the right to protest and peaceably assemble and they sued and won many important supreme court cases around this too i think socialists make a terrible mistake when they imagine that the bourgeois revolutions of the late established civil liberties civil liberties were won exactly the same way that economic concessions are won through bottomup struggle the idea that civil liberties are themselves bourgeois is an insidious leninist lie that should be dismissed
socialism,not_removed,i was thinking of this the other day were told to support the troops because theyre the ones protecting our freedom but if you look at what the troops have been sent out to do its rarely something about protecting our freedom did we get an hour work day because we won the war with mexico no are our children free to not have to work in the mines because we invaded the philippines no do women have the right to vote because the german empire was trying to take it away from us no all of those rights were fought and won by ordinary citizens in the streets not by soldiers on the fronts do respect the soldiers because it wasnt their war theyre fighting just know that the reasons for us going to war with outside forces are very rarely about us protecting freedom
socialism,not_removed,oh definitely true actually its much more common for important freedoms to be taken away as a result of military struggles including victorious ones see japanese internment espionage act cointelpro patriot act etc
socialism,not_removed,revolution civil war wwii but otherwise yes
socialism,not_removed,is this generally true the oppresed class conquers its freedoms through class struggle yes that is a really basic socialist statement its the basis of class struggle super quick for you the oppresd class fighting against their oppressors through history for more and more freedom first they were slaves they fought and won and became serfs which is a bit better but still not good enough class struggle continued the french revolution the american independence the oppresed class of serfs won yet another victory and became proletarians still a bit better but not good enough they now own themselves but not the product of their labor we are now at that stage to be continued
socialism,not_removed,this is a great response but where did lenin say civil liberties are bourgeois and in what context
socialism,not_removed,freedom of speech press and religion is enshrined in the first amendment but it wasnt taken seriously until the early to mid century im not sure youve noticed but those words still arent taken seriously by the us gov we have freedom of speech yes until people got arrested making vaguely anticop statements on twitter our press is free yes free to take marching orders directly from the dnc andor rewrite the history of the kurdish struggle as its happening we have freedom of privacy except for the million americans who are suspected of being potential enemies of the state and who are monitored by the us government we have freedom of assembly that is if you can live particularly long without water civil rights under capitalism are just words our rights may be of some use in some select circumstances but even today the moment the workers get the tiniest bit uppity the moment the situation turns the slightest bit revolutionary the us government has absolutely no problem dismissing them
socialism,not_removed,to demand a right is a very affirmative position it assumes there already is a state and rights that you are excluded from so its not really appropriate for a communist to demand a right after all rights are force and they serve the purpose to uphold the framework conditions of capitalism even though many rights labour rights women rights gay rights etc pp we have resulted from struggle we cant tell ourselves that socialism is a fight for civic recognition its the a movement to abolish the restraints of capitalism its rights and impertinences and this insidous leninist lie is a basic concept of marxism you obviously have yet to grasp
socialism,not_removed,all very good points
socialism,not_removed,it should but to the majority of people in the world it has been almost entirely forgotten take the hours work week it came from union strikes in my country the diamond workers strike yet nobody today wonders where it came from and takes it as a given worse they stop to wonder why and demand any more this something entirely of today because even in the and there were serious discussions going on about shortening the workweek today they are talking about increasing the workweek just one example how people have forgotten how we got to where we are and how much it costs us and how much we still have to struggle for tldr it should but it isnt and thats a big problem
socialism,not_removed,all of those things were accompanied by massive social and labor movements led by people critical of those conflicts who believed that war was being used as a pretext to clamp down on the civil liberties of politically unpopular groups
socialism,not_removed,you know theres a case to be made for ops point that even if you take those three wars specifically which zinn himself walks through in his talk holy wars to look at the alternate side even if you take those three there are certainly a number of contrafacts to consider for instance the revolutionary war did not get freedom for the slaves and only got them counted as a person in the consitutional compromise it only barely improved the the freedoms of some colonists ie the white male propertyowners even then it took until to get the bill of rights added which still left a lot of gaps finally again worth noting as per zinn canada got independence wo a huge war the civil war while fought over the institution of slavery in fact didnt get it abolished everywhere also it still left sharecropping and then a huge pushback that really didnt help most former slaves until virtually wwii plus during that whole period from reconstruction to the there were enormous movements ranging from antitrust to the workday to womens suffrage that not only didnt benefit from the civil war but were significantly setback in wwii itself which zinn takes kind of headon as a bomber vet etc etc to ask the question was it worth it even then there are a lot of questions to start from the internment of the japanese to spying to the dropping of not only the atomic bombs but firebombs and as zinn cites the earliest uses of napalm to the incredible development of propaganda which is arguably the most powerful weapon against democracy and human rights well its worth thinking about for sure but even just typing this all up id have to support ops point and zinns that its arguable that even taking the best of what we consider to be the holy wars as unquestionably necessary and just that none of them really helped advanced human rights or benefits and theres a lot to argue for in the opposite side for sure anyway heres the three holy wars talk thats just fantastic min
socialism,not_removed,he may talk about it more specifically elsewhere but i know he at least mentions it in state and revolution chapter v equality apparently reigns supreme but when lassalle having in view such a social order usually called socialism but termed by marx the first phase of communism says that this is equitable distribution that this is the equal right of all to an equal product of labor lassalle is mistaken and marx exposes the mistake hence the equal right says marx in this case still certainly conforms to bourgeois law whichlike all law implies inequality all law is an application of an equal measure to different people who in fact are not alike are not equal to one another that is why the equal right is violation of equality and an injustice in fact everyone having performed as much social labor as another receives an equal share of the social product after the abovementioned deductions but people are not alike one is strong another is weak one is married another is not one has more children another has less and so on and the conclusion marx draws is with an equal performance of labor and hence an equal share in the social consumption fund one will in fact receive more than another one will be richer than another and so on to avoid all these defects the right instead of being equal would have to be unequal the first phase of communism therefore cannot yet provide justice and equality differences and unjust differences in wealth will still persist but the exploitation of man by man will have become impossible because it will be impossible to seize the means of productionthe factories machines land etcand make them private property in smashing lassalles pettybourgeois vague phrases about equality and justice in general marx shows the course of development of communist society which is compelled to abolish at first only the injustice of the means of production seized by individuals and which is unable at once to eliminate the other injustice which consists in the distribution of consumer goods according to the amount of labor performed and not according to needs the vulgar economists including the bourgeois professors and our tugan constantly reproach the socialists with forgetting the inequality of people and with dreaming of eliminating this inequality such a reproach as we see only proves the extreme ignorance of the bourgeois ideologists marx not only most scrupulously takes account of the inevitable inequality of men but he also takes into account the fact that the mere conversion of the means of production into the common property of the whole society commonly called socialism does not remove the defects of distribution and the inequality of bourgeois laws which continues to prevail so long as products are divided according to the amount of labor performed continuing marx says gtbut these defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged after prolonged birth pangs from capitalist society law can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby and so in the first phase of communist society usually called socialism bourgeois law is not abolished in its entirety but only in part only in proportion to the economic revolution so far attained ie only in respect of the means of production bourgeois law recognizes them as the private property of individuals socialism converts them into common property to that extentand to that extent alonebourgeois law disappears however it persists as far as its other part is concerned it persists in the capacity of regulator determining factor in the distribution of products and the allotment of labor among the members of society the socialist principle he who does not work shall not eat is already realized the other socialist principle an equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor is also already realized but this is not yet communism and it does not yet abolish bourgeois law which gives unequal individuals in return for unequal really unequal amounts of labor equal amounts of products this is a defect says marx but it is unavoidable in the first phase of communism for if we are not to indulge in utopianism we must not think that having overthrown capitalism people will at once learn to work for society without any rules of law besides the abolition of capitalism does not immediately create the economic prerequisites for such a change now there are no other rules than those of bourgeois law to this extent therefore there still remains the need for a state which while safeguarding the common ownership of the means of production would safeguard equality in labor and in the distribution of products the state withers away insofar as there are no longer any capitalists any classes and consequently no class can be suppressed but the state has not yet completely withered away since the still remains the safeguarding of bourgeois law which sanctifies actual inequality for the state to wither away completely complete communism is necessary i think what he is saying is that because all people are materially unequal some people just need more resources than others naturally through their own consumption or through their dependents holding them accountable to universal rules is in fact an unequal and unfair thing to do in fact saying that we all have the right to free speech can be considered unequal because someone who owns a media company will materially have more of an ability to make that free speech heard however once the material conditions for true equality is realized full communism woo having equal rights with respect to the law will be redundant since we wont have a state to enforce them society will just work that way so there is no way for equal rights to actually be equal since in practice under capitalism and socialism we still have inequality and once we have real equality under communism rights as a societal reality and concept will have disappeared anyway and would effectively be an outmoded way of thinking
socialism,not_removed,tru
socialism,not_removed,im a millennial and too many of my peers have been taught that oppressed and otherwise disadvantaged groups were magnanimously gifted their rights after politicians and businesspeople had a change of heart when i was still in my undergrad i was pretty active in an lgbt group on my campus for a while however i left because all of the obama and the democrats singlehandedly gave lgbt people rights and slaaaaaaay kween notorious rbg and omg bank of america had a float in the pride parade weve really made it bullshit became too much to bear its gross how modern history ignores the struggle and violence oppressed people have had to endure in order to be treated with a modicum dignity and respect
socialism,not_removed,this something entirely of today because even in the and there were serious discussions going on about shortening the workweek today they are talking about increasing the workweek weve done nothing but go backwards the past few decades
socialism,not_removed,did any of these conflicts have that i know the swp was crucified over wwii but when in the civil war or during the revolution did that happen
socialism,not_removed,the revolution has to be considered in a number of contexts considering that dominant ethnic group male and property owning describes the state after every independence struggle canada is not as relevant in my opinion since they are so completely different and much smaller and less populous the cp published a lot of pro american revolution literaure around the bicentennial and in context it is convincing remember this is before the french revolution so as long as you dont have a bizarre obsession with the founding fathers like with that stupid musical or the tea partiers then you can look at each side of it and know how it fits together i was taught about sharecropping and all of that sure but we dont learn nearly enough about reconstruction the entire south was placed under military districts and then gained statehood with all the confederates disenfranchised and you saw real governments with blacks and the poor playing major roles even if capitalists manipulated them to build railroads and stuff like that reconstruction really is a fascinating period where abolitionists tried to create a real revolution in the south wwii is complicated but i think largely it is a matter of the cynicism of the defense department and interment and not the war itself i mean the soviets did horrific things but we celebrate the gpw here the question was whether wars did contribute to progress and i think that is true not that they were by any means perfect
socialism,not_removed,ultranationalism scapegoating of minority populations encouragement of political and racebased violence to influence voter turnout and so on clearly hes not the exact same but theres a striking similarity in tone and tactics
socialism,not_removed,i remember when brosocialist used to mean something awesome article on this very phenomenon and widely applicable
socialism,not_removed,i understand what youre saying but the other extreme of that situation class essentialism can be just as bad in my opinion too often i see people saying something to the effect of that isnt about class so we dont need to talk about it and that any discussion about racism misogyny homophobia transphobia ableism etc is just distracting identity politics and doesnt need to be addressed its the same kind of we should be uniting not dividing concern trolling whining i hear from all lives matter people claiming every discussion not focused on them is unnecessary division im all for talking about how these other various forms of oppression relate to class which i think is more along the lines of what you were saying in the op but i think sometimes people forget how important these topics are just in general
socialism,not_removed,at some point a few years ago i saw it used in reference to male leftists in physical circles who abused harassed or otherwise treated female comrades like shit and whose rhetoric reflected that this is a good definition over time though ive noticed that it gets deployed at anyone who isnt down to just endlessly discuss privilege politics and actually tries to bring discussion back to a materialist classfocused center to the complete detriment of sensible left thought i dont know whybut it does seem like we talk about privilege politics too much these days but now that ive said thisill probably be branded a brocialist too how about we just stop calling people names and actually listen when they explain what their beliefs are
socialism,not_removed,it does not weaken socialism in the slightest to acknowledge the unique injustices inflicted on other oppressed people through the mechanism of capitalism
socialism,not_removed,this thread cannot go well
socialism,not_removed,im a little disappointed that in all the discussion of identity and privilege politics happening in this thread there is little emphasis on sensitivity toward the experience of being a member of the oppressed social groups usergeantstatic makes a great point about the pitfalls of class essentialism and i agree with their point about talking about how these various forms of oppression relate to class but a big part of solidarity is validating the lived experiences of our comrades the underlying point then is that when those experiences arent validated and conversations about specific types of oppression are ignored or pivoted back to class it disenfranchises and marginalizes the person who wants to be heard and validated perhaps the term brocialist gets bandied around too much and is reactionary but i also understand its use for those who seemingly support the cause but then are unwilling to support the lived experience of oppression from those unlike themselves and cant seem to conceptualize the fact that a postrevolution life would incorporate significant changes to their life that would not include many of the privileged qualities of their current environment i personally believe that capitalismclass is the genesis point for all the other forms of oppression however nonclass justifications for those types of oppression have been cemented into social consciousness we need to strike at those oppressions jointly with class oppression because at this point its unreasonable to expect that you could rid the world of class and people would simultaneously stop being racist sexist homophobic ableist etc
socialism,not_removed,i think its definitely been hijacked by liberals to posture like socialists are inherently misogynist or whatever when douche bags like jonathan chait are using it you know it has probably run its course then something like that is the definition of misogynyerasing class essentialism happens and it makes me want to use it i probably shouldnt but i just get so frustrated with how so many people on the left just do not care about feminism or even actively despise it it isnt just frustrating as a woman who has to deal with it but as a socialist who sees how much that weakens the movement without overromanticizing them i really think socialists in the us and elsewhere could really learn a lesson from groups like the kurdish resistance to isis especially where women are not a sideissue but a central part of the movement and platform
socialism,not_removed,whether you like it or not identity politics has and continues to play a big role in the liberation and empowerment of people rejecting all kinds of identity politics as spooks and focusing entirely on the class struggle is extremely counterproductive and hurtful to the socialist movement a brocialist is someone who does that usually because theyre white males who dont feel represented by identity politics
socialism,not_removed,a brocialist is a person who seeks to use socialism and leftist thought to benefit only themselves most brocialists ive met are white people who do not want to see that racism both individual and institutionalized exists and that they merely by virtue of knowing socialist thought have not overcome it example the sanders supporters types who like saying that theyll vote donald trump and if he turns out to be a real fascist that people of color deserve what we get because we didnt vote sanders
socialism,not_removed,i dont get the conflict between talking about feminismprivilege and class hell i talk alot about both and often togheter
socialism,not_removed,httpiimgurcomoeaaiwfjpg
socialism,not_removed,does anyone remember when homosexuality and abortion were criminalized in the soviet union case in point
socialism,not_removed,its a lot like tankie in being a term invented by communists to criticize specific positions within the movement thats been coopted by liberals to mean any communist i do still feel like its useful though since there are still plenty of socialists who dont think feminism is necessary or go on about transness being bourgeois decadence or whatever and its nice to have a shorthand to call them
socialism,not_removed,first of all at op i believe that you have been done wrong by having this term applied to you i hear you that this term is overused further one might say that it shifts culpability in a no true socialist sort of way that is to say that the problems of boorish and myopic behavior are something that socialists never engage in but hear me out if you will because privilege makes people uncomfortable because it implies culpability to avoid privilegetalk is the same way we have racism without racists it is equivalent to using the passive voice mistakes were made yes but what mistakes and more importantly by whom and were they really mistakes it forces a privileged actor including myself in many ways to acknowledge that we benefit from being silent and complicit in a system of hierarchy it points a finger and that is very uncomfortable because then you have to question everything in terms of whatever meager comforts afforded you when you know as perhaps a member of the working class that you have so little but the little you do have was not the result of your own sterling qualities but is in fact subsidized by oppression and thus by extension the brocialist stance is quite similar to the taxation is theft rallying cry of reactionary libertarians and i say this again as a privileged actor furthermore one can inhabit the position of privileged and oppressed simultaneously we people generally have a tendency to create a binary when none need exist in fact there is a contextual and contingent qualitative liminal space where real life happens i am privileged in one way and oppressed in another this is complicated and nuanced and hard lets be real who has the energy to break that down all the time but i think it is still worth including in the analysis no matter how irksome it is
socialism,not_removed,the task of revolution has always been incredibly hard and we look for what shortcuts we can brocialism as a term was originally in reaction to rape abuse and parties that discriminated against their female members it is no a shortcut that seeks to deal with a whole host of intellectual theoretical and political questions that are sometimes rooted in personal bias often not and it seems pretty inadequate for the task even worse is that we all have different definitions and loaded feelings on the term based on what weve seen and the unspoken standards we have
socialism,not_removed,i think this is a tired conversation tbh i do think its funny however that you decry liberal identity politics yet you fall into the logic of it when you hold up your various identities as an argument against this often vague misapplied critique of you i sympathize with your post it just hasnt been that big a deal in my experience maybe i just tune it out cause i dont find it interesting but i also think people get overzealous and not quite very wellinformed about the explicitly class issues of socialism as well
socialism,not_removed,someone who claims to be a socialist yet only shows solidarity with their most local classes in society usually midupperclass white males that struggle with other white males and largely ignoredeny any issues of womenracismhomophobia
socialism,not_removed,im going to give you one opportunity do you or do you not believe that there is more types of oppression than class oppression that these types of oppression need to be struggled on specifically but also in conjunction with class politics
socialism,not_removed,ts am and im seriously reeling about getting called one because i told someone that reading and understanding marxian thought isnt privileged i honestly dont even know what to say i think i genuinely am feeling as confused as you are right now i mean i could understand if someone was making the argument that only some people can afford the time and chance to read about marxism but im just stumped like saying reading marxian thought is privileged is like saying wanting to exercise for yourself and your own health is fat shaming others
socialism,not_removed,i dont think brocialist even has any meaning anymore ive heard anarchists use it to describe mls and mlms and vice versa its one of those words that gets thrown around way too frequently so people start treating it as a generic insult
socialism,not_removed,op you are not my fucking comrade
socialism,not_removed,i definitely agree with the broader point here socialists and other leftists groups particularly those focusing primarily on social andor economic justice are constantly acting divisively and bickering among themselves ive never experienced any feelings of group unity camaraderie or solidarity at least not in any online community ive been a part of and ive certainly seen plenty of this among local noninternet groups as well especially in my college days whatever the reason is whatever peoples objections are this problem is very real and the horrible irony of it is that it all stems from philosophies and movements that are supposed to be about unity and solidarity how terrible is it that these are the very groups that cant get along with each other i think this is the biggest threat to the leftist movements now due to not having any sense of solidarity or cohesion it prevents there from being a larger movement borne out of the smaller ones this petty bickering immediately disinclines potential allies and new members from joining up they see this toxic environment and run the fuck away and were at a point in the world where the people are in greater and greater numbers rejecting the neoliberal paradigm and its establishment but they dont have much anywhere else to turn to other than reactionary right wing philosophies and movements because thats what has solidarity right now in standing against neoliberalism were going to lose the world if we cant get our shit together and see beyond our surfacelevel petty differences i dont know what the solution here is people need to open themselves up to differing points of view stop treating their particular ideology and philosophy as inscrutable dogma stop hurling abuse at people that they disagree with and treat people who are their allies like well allies but how to actually get people to do that i have no idea the fact that their point of view is treated like inscrutable dogma and their first reaction is to argue with if not lash out against anyone who transgresses that dogma means that they are in no way willing or able to change their behavior maybe we just need to call people out on this behavior with respect and kindness and show them theres a better way that sounds naive and tacky but its all ive got i strongly suspect is the internalization of the abuse we all suffer thats normalized by are culture and are conditioned to receive and give as a means of elevating our own feelings of worth
socialism,not_removed,httpiimgurcomoeaaiwfjpg
socialism,not_removed,i would be wary of anyone who actually accuses another person of being a brocialist obviously since the term just came about through peoples frustrations of male leftists that denigrate the struggles of female leftists the definition is probably going to vary on who you ask if you ask me we would need to sort out racism sexism antilgbtqplus other persuasions sentiment before we can even hope to succeed at socialism since a divided working class wont be able to challenge the supremacy of the borgeousie overall i wouldnt worry about it too much you will come to see differences with other leftists liberals progressives etc and youre definitely going to see people not checking their privilege and unfairly bringing up someone else privilege when it is not called for there are no easy answers for us just our judgement we all have to be able to argue our points with sound reasoning recognize when we are wrong and find common ground when it is worth the effort
socialism,not_removed,we need to stop being dogmatic lee kuan yew a free market fundamentalist and former president of singapore worked with communists to achieve his goals im not saying that we should not judge them for their views but we should not treat them as scum any comrade if he is a brocialist or a communist should be accepted as someone who is willing to fight for socialism if a person is commited to socialism and willing to fight next to me in the revolution they are my comrade and friend the problems of hate will be dealt with after the revolution
socialism,not_removed,its a postmodernist way of telling someone to fuck off without them realizing how ridiculous they sound
socialism,not_removed,it was the plan all along muahahahah
socialism,not_removed,ive been looking for this thanks a ton forget the term but im definitely going to start using it now that ive seen it again
socialism,not_removed,im really not seeing that phenomenon on any of the communities im part of
socialism,not_removed,class essentialism can be is just as bad in my opinion ftfy without solidarity one can not be a socialist
socialism,not_removed,i agree exactly with you about the all lives matter people of course all lives matter but not everyone is being disenfranchised people of african descent are
socialism,not_removed,yeah agreed i tend to be more sympathetic with so called brocialists now only because this insane over emphasis on privilege and identity has pretty much eclipsed any real discussion focused on class so the fervor with which leftypol defends their little class essentialist enclave seems like a natural reaction im really hard pressed to think of a left circle im involved with where class essentialism rather than amateur pomo soapboxing about xyz everydayfeminism sounding fake privilege talk is the problem
socialism,not_removed,wed be working against ourselves to ignore all those things and work on class alone it would be too difficult once we iron out these issues class will come in time
socialism,not_removed,i dont know whybut it does seem like we talk about privilege politics too much these days i thought so at first too but of the people that i know who call themselves socialistsand arent bernites almost none of them talk about privelege and such very much then again all those people are white males so maybe theres some sample bias
socialism,not_removed,come join the brocialist brigade comrade in all seriousness this is why ive almost completely cut myself off from any group that isnt explicitly marxistleninist and familiar with materialist thought and dialectics its too exhausting and witchhunty
socialism,not_removed,i think the american left has a focus on privelage politics because the broad left is so much more liberal than in other countries and the influence of left liberalism is far greater its less possible to hold the marxism explains patriarchy position that is possible in other countries the other factor is that the working class is less organised just in general because of the history of repression etc so for many years the working class has not had the same role in social progressive causes that it has in other countries means that you have to have some explanation for that which ended up either being like thirdworldism but also the idea that white workers benefit from black oppression or white men from womens oppression ie privlage politics wheras in reality in places where wages between different groups are more equitable they are also higher in absolute terms
socialism,not_removed,thread stupid discussion overall with what imo is a false conflict between privilegefeminism and class im confused why its set up that way
socialism,not_removed,hands you some popcorn
socialism,not_removed,i was intentionally trying not to read this because the title gave me such an uncomfortable gut reaction but i guess i have to now i think theres a major difference in my eyes between socialists who just want to get back to talking about class in tandem with other oppressive strains and are tired of the neoliberal highjacking versus male leftists who seriously dont fucking care about it dont respect women think its all shrill bitching and just refuse to acknowledge it even for a second thats what this article is and thats that shit i hate and thats what i would call brocialism but never the former
socialism,not_removed,then something like jacobins recent article on abortion that is the definition of misogynyerasing class essentialism happens and it makes me want to use it is that really so abhorrent every other media source covering the case presents it from the perspective of liberal feminism i dont think that one editorial article that points out that the struggle for womens rights is tied to the struggle for workers rights is a bad thing especially in the wider context that state abortion bans only harm lowincome women not wealthy women
socialism,not_removed,i probably shouldnt but i just get so frustrated with how so many people on the left just do not care about feminism or even actively despise it i think most of them just arent educated enough on the topic most feminist articles ive seen posted on leftist subreddits are incredibly outdated and dont have much bearing in daily arguments with rightlibertarians and all kinds of antifeminists i would personally love to see some better material that i can implement into daytoday conversation
socialism,not_removed,in my admittedly limited experience leftists are much more willing to selfcrit on other axes of oppression than liberals are and that they are also kinder to each other when doing so
socialism,not_removed,the sanders supporters types who like saying that theyll vote donald trump and if he turns out to be a real fascist is this actually a thing if it is i want to hang myself
socialism,not_removed,fuck this bougie shit so much istg fullcommunism
socialism,not_removed,broviet union
socialism,not_removed,homosexuality wasnt tolerated in the russian empire either all stalin did was roll back the progress lenin made towards legalizing homosexuality and it was accepted because the vast majority of russia at the time was culturally opposed to it stalin did a lot of things counter to socialism as leader of the soviet union russia was already a very homophobic nation i dont think the brocialist opinion on these subjects is one that will last and is a product of culture which is rapidly changing overt homophobia is no longer tolerated transphobia is looked at as bad taste by most people as well its only a matter of time before these attitudes and tendencies are but a small segment of the left there is a huge difference between the attitudes of today and those in when homosexuality was recriminalized by stalin
socialism,not_removed,its amusing to me that i can even coherently defend this because i dont fully agree with it but the socialists i know who dont think feminism is necessary dont think that a women dont suffer in any unique or extreme regard under capitalism or that b class and gender or class and race or class and x what have you grouping dont interact in specific and unique ways as a rule they just and i would say rightly think that feminism uncoupled from a truly materialist classconscious analysis inevitably derails movement building and results in obsessive individualistic privilege discourse this is me giving them the benefit of the doubt honestly and saying what i assume they would say if theyd just uncouple themselves from their ahhhhhh idpol slightly mra nonunderstanding of what socialist feminism is but i dont think this is wrongheaded or even completely out of touch with what ive seen happen in even explicitly leftist circles as a result of tumblr infused identity politics i think the shorthand is dangerous not because it doesnt describe a specific type of masculinist leftist who is drawn to far left rev circles but because it almost immediately scapegoats the person in question regardless of what theyre actually saying be it actual misogyny or just asking to stop yelling about fake privileges and get back to the task at hand shuts down any dissenting conversation for fear of retaliation and is just at its core a lazy shorthand that allows the accuser to elide actually engaging in conversation or engaging with the brocialist in question about what they disagree on edit also to this i most frequently see it used by extremely beginner or novice leftists who in all likelihood did get tipped onto socialism by tumblr or some comparable site who use it against anyone whom even casually pushes up against their learned familiarity with how one does politics right even if the only thing theyre pushing up against is their bourgeois idealism i have seen people almost verbatim quote marxs critique of bourgeois human rights and get shot down as problematic brocialists because they are against human rights the privilege when in reality thats just a very basic takedown of bourgeois liberalism it enables shoddy kneejerk responses and i personally think disincentives learning critical thinking and productive debate
socialism,not_removed,to avoid privilegetalk is the same way we have racism without racists i actually think that pursuing this line of thought leads you pretty close to a kind of vulgar moralizing psychologism explicitly rejected by marxfor m the problem with capitalism is not specific capitalists or their attitudes its capitalism it makes as little sense to call certain capitalists greedy as to say that capitalism is the fault of capitalists marxism is in some deep sense a theory that thinks in the passive voice or rather in the deep impersonality of nonhuman substantives capital reproduces itself relations of production reproduce themselves capital generates its own contradictions
socialism,not_removed,i brought up those identities because i almost exclusively ever see the term brocialist thrown at white straight men regardless of the content of their commentary whereas women lgbt people and poc people have much more leeway to say even downright abusive or violent things veiled in socialist language with total impunity absolutely its tired and this thread makes me never want to address the subject again
socialism,not_removed,op is clearly not a brosocialist and we still have to have someone ask it god class oppression is the root of homophobia patriarchy racism bigotry yes it is the most important no im not saying oppresive systems outside of class oppression dont matter it is easier to fight subsets of a system than the system it self
socialism,not_removed,i think the myriad forms of oppression are materialist in origin and need to be tackled at all times alongside class yes but clearly racism and misogyny and homophobia are their own related but not identical oppressive forces
socialism,not_removed,you could argue that almost anything is privileged this is just a shaming technique used by most smallminded people who wish to vilify others and create division calling out other peoples privileges often does little to rectify injustice and creates enemies it further distances us from the majority of the working class whom we need on our side there are better tactics at tackling injustice that are more effective
socialism,not_removed,ive heard anarchists use it to describe mls and mlms and vice versa well technically speaking the idea of brocialism isnt exclusive to any one tendency
socialism,not_removed,well maybe because trans comrades are getting literally murdered every day simply for existing have you ever even met a fucking oppressed person in your life
socialism,not_removed,gender identity politics is valid and has its place but it is number on the list not number this is what i agree with here until people feel secure in their life situation you cannot confront their insecurities that lead to sexist racist or homophobic views the only way that can be achieved is to empower individuals so that they can safely lose their insecurities empowering workers to seize the means of production should be the number one issue for socialists of any stripe and until that is achieved everything else is just a distraction from that primary cause
socialism,not_removed,i love you comrade many uwus
socialism,not_removed,try to be objective youll probably be criticized unfairly on occasion and fairly on others thats life in a commune
socialism,not_removed,you probably will be but likely not for your politics but rather demeanor and behavior because in all likelihood you have those entitled masculinist internalized things that will quickly be brought to your attention dont be embarrassed just stay humble and be aware and courteous and mind your own learned behaviors and try to shake the bad ones
socialism,not_removed,perhaps we should just create a united communist party that will act as an umbrella group for smaller parties the party itself could either run or endorse other candidates in elections for instance based on local strength and act as a tool to help create a unified front it would basically act as a party that anyone could join and one could also still have membership in other socialist parties as well
socialism,not_removed,i support socialism because its good for me and people like me the working class whats wrong with that not every socialist is motivated by a sense of liberal guilt
socialism,not_removed,damn this is so sweeping and nonspecific that i am having a hard time even responding ill just come out and say if these people wanted to be fascists or believed in or even sort of sided with fascists theyd be fascists the altright is just as niche and weird a political ideology to side with as communism and comes with infinitely less social flak supporting trump is less violently opposed by normie liberals than supporting communist nations and regimes furthermore a lot of brocialists and nontumblr leftists including myself actually woke up and went from being libertarians and ancaps into fullfledged mls theyve been there and theres a reason they took such a degree turn in alignment because theyre genuinely not fascists they just disagree with you about idpol almost every single classexclusive brocialist that ive met believe that all oppressive realities stem directly from class hierarchy private property and exploitation and therefore believe that the elimination of capitalism would liberate all workers not just other straight white men especially given the fact that straight white men and women lgbt people and poc alike are still exploited by wage labor and class hierarchy that doesnt mean they dont frequently engage in misogynistic myopic behavior and flat out ignore the totality of how class intersects and is mutually constitutative with race and gender but it doesnt make them fascists
socialism,not_removed,so youd rather have a bunch of reactionary white male comrades rather than address and include minorities and the marginalized
socialism,not_removed,please dont ever talk to a mentally ill person like this in real life the patronizing is painful i call myself mentally ill because im ill i have bpd mdd anxiety schizotypal pd various chemical dependencies and paranoia it makes my life and my relationships hard and i sometimes am on the verge of hospitalization or suicide im pretty ill
socialism,not_removed,if you posted about of this comment on kia or trp or any other septic tank of misogyny it would blend in perfectly a few pointers stop referencing tumblr as it relates to feminism because you might as well cite for the rise of rightwing extremist politics in europe for all the credibility that has nobody with political or feminist philosophical clout considers tumblr a significant force in their endeavours or id be willing to bet even knows what tumblr is and you consistently using tumblr as an example of modern feminism implies a significant lack of realworld familiarity outside the internet stop using the term sjw unironically like cuck or libtard its a meaningless catchall term with no positive value as language and it only signals to everyone around you that you a take internet culture unhealthily seriously and b spend your time in the circlejerking bowels of the internet if im able to read your comment and not be able to distinguish it from the thousands of hatefilled letters of bile and sludge that come out of the rightwing subs of reddit every single day youre probably not in the right sub and i either suggest that you reexamine your political beliefs or go to a different place to spew your loathing
socialism,not_removed,holy buzzwords batman
socialism,not_removed,them damn essjaydubya tumblr libruls s
socialism,not_removed,oh god
socialism,not_removed,wow your fields must be riddled with crows to need that many strawmen
socialism,not_removed,without them realizing how ridiculous they sound postmodernist lol
socialism,not_removed,as a white cishet male i have never experienced any of this fucking shit are you sure you werent just acting like an antifem jackass
socialism,not_removed,are you complaining about antiwhite racism seriously whats divisive is you not giving a fuck about womens lgbt and nonwhite oppression
socialism,not_removed,people that discriminate you because you are white hetero male or whatever you want to be have quite fascist tendencies first off if they really knew what socialism is about they wouldnt discriminate against the privileged because its reactionary and generalizes i am white male and heterosexual so basically i should be hanged feminism is a large and diverse movement but the position you describe here is cartoonish and not representative of of people who use the moniker moreover feminists militantly advancing their positions does not make them wrong and certainly doesnt make them fascists you might disagree with some aspects of nonsocialist feminism as you rightly should but that does not make them wholly wrong or undeserving of your support i suggest you try to listen to feminists and understand their positions be careful not to dismiss them simply because they speak out against white male hetero culture its not an indictment of you personally and its an analysis worth listening to and internalizing to your own political awareness in second place i find this stupid because this is meant to divide us we fight between ourselves and we forget who are we really supposed to fight feminism is not meant to divide us feminism is a response to that which already divides us that is patriarchy just like antiracism is a response to the division of racism if you think its feminism that is responsible for division within the left you are seriously mistaken in your analysis if you are serious about fighting alongside your brothers and sisters irrespective of their race and class you should take feminism seriously its an indispensable component of any socialist politics worth the name
socialism,not_removed,yeah it was the one big takeaway from my time subscribed to marxist memes
socialism,not_removed,subs lousy with those types unfortunately
socialism,not_removed,without solidarity one can not be a socialist whats wrong with sectarianism and a divided left come on now you cant have both pick one
socialism,not_removed,thats understandable truthfully though i do support the everydayfeminism social justice type conversations and their emphasis on being aware of privilege and being cautious with speech and action that reinforces oppressive social structures i also realize that they cant on their own solve the underlying structural problems of our society and that tying things back to class when applicable is an indispensable component of fighting all these seemingly classunrelated ills in our society
socialism,not_removed,yeah agreed i tend to be more sympathetic with so called brocialists now only because this insane over emphasis on privilege and identity has pretty much eclipsed any real discussion focused on class so the fervor with which leftypol defends their little class essentialist enclave seems like a natural reaction where is this occurring within realworld circles that you are trying to organize in or are you talking about the internet and reddit
socialism,not_removed,yeah what kind of world do you live in the only thing i ever hear is hey socialism class also class socialism oh hey heres a major thing about something else but which everyone should probably already know about
socialism,not_removed,youre completly right that these sort of words are not helpful the main reason being that instead of tackling ideas they tackle people and function as labels that set peoples claws out theres a reason why many on the right and bigoted collapse into hysterics once people on the left start in fighting using those words regarding reading and understanding marx thought as priviledged i think that there could be something there but it depends on the group can someone be in your group and not have read marx do you put your general ideas in a way that simple for everyone to understand and to see if there own ideas link up or are similar regardless of their education level
socialism,not_removed,come join the brocialist brigade comrade it doesnt help that i appear to be at the top of the privilege hierarchy i am a white cishet male european its too exhausting and witchhunty as i saidwe should just refrain from calling people names
socialism,not_removed,that isnt explicitly marxistleninist and familiar with materialist thought and dialectics really in my experiences those are the most preachy about brocialism and identity politics now im like most of the responses here have been i am a feminist i have nothing against discourse about racism and sexism im certainly not abusive etc but some things go way over the top and some people on the left are far too witchhunty and among those types ive noticed far more mls than anybody else especially on facebook groups which tend to be almost exclusively ml i say this as a libertarian socialist who seldom talks about identity politics that is i talk about it when its relevant or is already being discussed like now and in my experiences most other people of similar tendencies are the same were all feminists but we also realize that there are other things to talk about
socialism,not_removed,hands out the garlic nooch you cant have popcorn without this
socialism,not_removed,oh yeah i agree i wish the former would feel more empowered to talk to other male leftists about it like i dont need male leftists calling other male leftists brocialists i need them being like hey dude i get where youre coming from but then i learned that
socialism,not_removed,absolutely the man who wrote it clearly has no understanding of how the law on abortion works for it is nothing like the law that governs strikes abortion is a fundamental unenumerated due process right strikes are governed by the wagner act and nlrb rules it doesnt talk about the hyde amendment at all which is the major next step in the reproductive rights movement and is all about class im all for linking womens rights to the struggle for workers rights but thats not this is this is hey lets talk about abortiojk lets talk about strikes and unions
socialism,not_removed,i think thats very much right thats why everyone should support rsocialismandfeminism
socialism,not_removed,sure but i never set the bar for what conduct i expect out of myself or others from as low of a standard as how the average liberal acts
socialism,not_removed,it isi got down voted when i said that it was crazy to vote for trump in rsandersforpresident some of them think they are similar some how
socialism,not_removed,dont get overly optimistic
socialism,not_removed,its amusing to me that i can even coherently defend this because i dont fully agree with it but the socialists i know who dont think feminism is necessary where have you encountered this rare species
socialism,not_removed,maybe read the post before you respond to it
socialism,not_removed,but it is necessary to acknowledge and dismantle the cultural hegemony of capitalism in order to actually dismantle capitalism forever
socialism,not_removed,thanks for making my point so succinct this exactly
socialism,not_removed,right so why are you disparaging those who take this view as discussing privilege politics youve fabricated a strawman of people who give a shit about different types of oppression and then complained about that strawman can you point to an example on this subreddit where this has occurred
socialism,not_removed,cut the all lives matter shit im not going to allow socialism to be whitewashed and coopted because white male reactionaries who do want free stuff for themselves arent committed enough to other peoples struggles
socialism,not_removed,yeah but i meant that one tendency will use it as an insult against another tendency with no consideration of the actual meaning of the word for example there was an anarchist who was complaining that this sub was brocialist simply because there are a lot of tankies
socialism,not_removed,most people here dont like this sentiment though there seem to be a lot of genderidentity people who are on the left rather than people on the left who are for genderidentity stuff if that makes sense
socialism,not_removed,my god off course they should be included im just saying that im accepting anyone who is willing to fight for socialism as a comrade
socialism,not_removed,this reminds me of what some liberal pc customer told me the other day i was helping her out with the fitting rooms i work at a clothing store and she asked why i we didnt give her the large dressing room and i told her we like to reserve that for the disabled and elderly and she snapped back and told me its not disabled its altered theyve been altered and its a gift i just got this disappointed look and i think i shocked her because i retorted back im not buying it as someone on the spectrum its insulting you would ever imply my condition was part of some plan or given to me i am very aware that i have a disability and youre policing of others language does nothing to stop discrimination fucking liberals also altered fucking really by whom for what purpose theres so many problems with this it is laughable
socialism,not_removed,this all of this
socialism,not_removed,reddit is an incubator of dilettantes and anything that makes young white men feel good
socialism,not_removed,i dont see socialism as a movement of socialists but as a movement of people our job as socialists is to guide and educate the people but never to control them and as such it is not our job to simply accept anyone who calls themself a socialist particularly when it comes to selfdescribed socialists whose ideas are in the last instance counterrevolutionary
socialism,not_removed,in what way does it get in the way of class struggle people say this but ive never heard of an instance where some feminist stopped a socialist from doing their work its almost always a problem of failing to organize people and then blaming it on whatever is currently drawing peoples attention
socialism,not_removed,whats it exactly my comment about solidarity applies equally to those who deny class politics in favor of their identity such as certain black nationalists as it does to class essentialists
socialism,not_removed,but theyre always applicable this is sort of my problem that things such as race and gender and etc dont exist seperate or superior to class theyre literally inextricable the notion of privilege as the end all and be all descriptor of the way power works is unhelpful at best and dangerous at worst because it removes us from a basic materialist understanding of the origins and behaviors of these various structures and very effectively blinds us with ideology i do think the privilege model and the various correlate terms are helpful springboards if youre completely new to thinking about power and hierachal structures but they very quickly lose their usefulness at a point and encourage truly strange descents into shit like tall privilege and monosexual privilege that are pretty much good just for online shit fits about nothing real
socialism,not_removed,i cringe every time everdayfeminism uses classism call it what it is its capitalism
socialism,not_removed,both unfortunately for most of the year im sequestered in a hyper rural corner of vermont at school so many irl organizing options are massively constrained to the internet but this is the norm when im back home with friends and comrades for the summer
socialism,not_removed,i honestly dont understand what youre trying to say here that you only ever encounter class essentialists i havent had an experience like that outside of leftypol in ever like in all of my memories of work and interaction with left circles hence the point of this entire thread
socialism,not_removed,if people deserve to get called names they should get called names i have zero qualms with calling a fascist a fascist a duck is a duck but this should only be the case when someone is spouting genuinely abhorrent reactionary dangerous opinions not simply because someone disagrees with you or is contesting your neophyte impression of what socialism actually is and this is why i think its so ridiculous to begin with it begins equating protofascist altright idiocy with a nontumblr version of socialism and other inoffensive left differences of thought its lazy
socialism,not_removed,yep thats pretty much the major downfall of wave feminism it dropped all the revolutionary intersectional strains of feminism and focused on propelling women into positions of power instead of crushing misogyny as an oppressive tool of the ruling class im glad that wave feminism seems to have dug up those radical roots and the fact that both whiny manbabies and rich ceos have nothing but negative things to say about us just shows were doing it right
socialism,not_removed,seriously fuck your brownie points actually engage with your shitty male counterparts
socialism,not_removed,that is a contentious claim that would probably be disputed by marx auch die nebelbildungen im gehirn der menschen sind notwendige sublimate ihres materiellen empirisch konstatierbaren und an materielle voraussetzungen geknüpften lebensprozesses die moral religion metaphysik und sonstige ideologie und die ihnen entsprechenden bewußtseinsformen behalten hiermit nicht länger den schein der selbständigkeit sie haben keine geschichte sie haben keine entwicklung sondern die ihre materielle produktion und ihren materiellen verkehr entwickelnden menschen ändern mit dieser ihrer wirklichkeit auch ihr denken und die produkte ihres denkens nicht das bewußtsein bestimmt das leben sondern das leben bestimmt das bewußtsein
socialism,not_removed,where in this thread did i say anyone was doing that hilariously there actually were a couple near the bottom that i think the commenter deleted unfortunately the down voted ones near the bottom i said in leftist circles generally privilege politics pervade with negative consequences not in this specific thread right now theres also a difference between identifying seperate clearly different strains of the manners in which assymmetrical relationships of power and dominance manifest and endlessly inventing fake non existent privileges or oppressions because youre stuck in an idealist wormhole are you familiar with mogai or the discourse surrounding class privilege because you have a shit job that hyperexploits you or darkmatter those are privilege politics that front like theyre leftist but are anything but
socialism,not_removed,there are plenty of people who consider themselves followers of critical theory yet remain pro capitalism the easiest example would be younger clintonites who have adapted the language of intersectionality in many ways i find brocialism far preferable to that because brocialism tends to be a manifestation of insufficient dialectics rather than an utter lack of ideology
socialism,not_removed,youre fucking god awful
socialism,not_removed,lmao found one in the wild with a pokemon video thats not gross and objectifying at all your fucking ideology is so bourgeois even your socialism has hierarchies that would be hilarious if it werent so gross
socialism,not_removed,they have to learn to share the stage with the rest of us disgusting it takes nothing away from a socialist movement to acknowledge the dignity and humanity of trans people
socialism,not_removed,theyre not ignoring intersectionality because they dont understand it or dont think race or gender or sexuality exist brocialists subscribe to an orthodox form of marxian thought that maintains that class hierarchy is at the root of all oppression and exploitation or in less hardline cases that class is the first or second most important factor in shaping not only how specific classes of individuals experience capitalist society but the trajectory that capitalisms evolution takes i fall into this camp so yes they are very much aware that gay people and women suffer differently than straight white men but theyre not going to indulge anyone and say that homophobia or misogyny are discrete ahistorical forces that exist totally in absence of class society theyre oppressive power regimes that are materialist in origin and are definitively tethered to class and theyll just argue not that they dont exist but that they are subsumed by the reality of material hierarchy i said in my first response that most of them dont care about feminism because they believe that idpol is inevitably neoliberal in scope and impact on movement building and by definition distracts from the baseline goal of eliminating class society and exploitation by the bourgeois theyre not pretending to care about those things not because they think they dont exist or they hate women or gay people or poc but because they maintain that misogyny homophobia etc are direct products of the internal contradictions of capitalism and class society that will be dealt with in turn with the elimination of class society and that the bandaid of idpol is just a distracted misdirected and easily coopted antimaterialist move if they didnt embrace the economic aspect of socialism they wouldnt be socialists no one on this board would be a socialist thats sort of the point of socialism
socialism,not_removed,what the fuck ew altered seriously like dont worry that youre an abnormal little freak because its gods plan its somehow so insulting and infatantalizing and bigoted and paternalistic all at the same time honestly i dont get what makes normies so uncomfortable with mentally ill disabled or neuroatypical just coming forth and explicitly acknowledging were theyre not normal like we know you sure know can we just get over it and stop trying to tell me all about how special i am heuuuurgh
socialism,not_removed,dont worry comrade im sorry that was sharp im just very used to non mentally ill people coddling and infatalizing and insulting me using that sort of language i do appreciate the support from one bpd to another
socialism,not_removed,nobodys triggered here im telling you that you sound like a hateful person youre using loaded terms and hatefilled language and youre making yourself look like a fullfledged moron and an outright bigot as a result either fix your attitude or fix which subs youre subscribed to
socialism,not_removed,tongue in cheek comment to begin with p but but thats the subjective at what point do you obtain the authority to make that decision especially in the narrative of people like mao zedong and maoists often called a counter revolutionary by certain groups yet was absolutely insanely and magnanimously popular with the chinese masses and at the center of their movement so when one says without solidarity one can not be a socialist and in the same breath writes off millions of socialists as counter revolutionaries you have a situation of cognitive dissonance at what point is one simply attempting to force their own definitions of socialism against the masses who have a different idea of socialism how is then being divorced from them being supportive of socialism youre right in that you dont have to simply accept anyone who calls themselves socialist weeding all fakersliberalsetc is something that happens at all stratums of the movement ed speaking in generalities not accusing you specifically
socialism,not_removed,oh im sorry i guess i misread your comment
socialism,not_removed,but theyre always applicable this is sort of my problem that things such as race and gender and etc dont exist seperate or superior to class theyre literally inextricable im not sure im seeing it the same way to me the way these things seem to be connected is in their relation to social standardshierarchies and how your relation to that ideal standard or your place on that hierarchy affects your position economically for instance it appears to me that racism exists independently of the economic class system not because of it but there is clearly a correlation between racism and classism in that people of color have fewer economic opportunities than white people is it not possible to have an economically classless society in which social forms of racial prejudice and discrimination take place
socialism,not_removed,theres this my feminism will be intersectional or it will be bullshit graphic i used to see floating around tumblr that included all the typical isms and at the very end was classism with what i guess was supposed to be two homeless women like i know yall arent advocating for the abolition of class so what do you suggest be polite to that single poor working mother while you exploit her bye to this the notion of classism is so silly and i get so angry when my leftist friends used it in conversation because it suggests that there is a natural difference between classes that simply needs to be smoothed over with anti oppression training or some similar bullshit and that somehow class is an internal identity rather than a product of material circumstances definitrly a major trigger word for me
socialism,not_removed,well theyre really not the same concept although obviously classism could not exist without capitalism an example of classism would be ignorantly telling an unemployed person to just get a job or saying poor people need to just manage money better or people on welfarefoodstampsetc are just asking for handouts because theyre lazy its the idea that people of a lower economic class deserve to be where they are and could get out if they really wanted to again this is a necessary component of capitalism but is different
socialism,not_removed,so how does it work are they simply unwilling to entertain any classbased organizing or are they outright antagonistic to class issues im just trying to understand because its not an experience ive had
socialism,not_removed,im not saying literal class essentialism what im saying is that the focus on socialism and class in socialist communities gets to a detrimental level one of the reasons this sub isnt so diverse is because so many people feel unwelcome here and i dont just mean our treatment of liberals i try to go on more mainstream social justice communities for that but honestly the lack of talk on ableism and ableism in those communities is also really annoying and then in communities about ableism it all seems to be about parents of mentally disabled children and theres no talk about physically disabled people and wheres the socialist intersectional community thats actually dedicated to that
socialism,not_removed,sorry i offended your leninist sensibilities
socialism,not_removed,using the word sjw in a socialist subreddit thanks for being exactly the definition of what op asked
socialism,not_removed,did you really say sjw for fucks sakes thats not even what they call themselves they are wokes the only people i have seen who use sjw unironically are liberals mostly because they use it as an insult and refuse to call them by their real name
socialism,not_removed,witchhunts by idpol sjws lmao poes law is officially in effect
socialism,not_removed,i dont see what we gain by quoting marx here httpsenwikipediaorgwikiculturalhegemony is a marxist position marxs theory that economics alone would cause the revolution isnt something that we should hold as unassailable dogma if property magically ceased to exist today people tomorrow would still uphold the hierarchical culture of the bourgeois muh human nature and all that somebody could be outcast and starving under capitalism with its horror staring them in the face and still believe in the ruling classs ideology and thus do nothing if you think this is unnecessary fine it certainly wont hurt to dismantle bourgeois ideas decolonize our minds and selfcriticize
socialism,not_removed,endlessly inventing fake non existent privileges or oppressions can you give an example of a fake non existent privilege or oppression
socialism,not_removed,nobody gives a shit about liberals in this context we get that theyre blinded by ideology etc were discussing examples of socialists which have done what op is saying
socialism,not_removed,yes i disagree with identity politics and intersectionality its very easy to simply mask bigotry within left wing rhetoric on this issue however which is why i was asking for clarification
socialism,not_removed,you have been invited to talk on tv for an hour about the socialist movement how do you allocate your time boom youre ranking the issues so from my point of view youre the god awful one holding the movement back
socialism,not_removed,i hate it when people try to imply mentally ill people are special its like they purposefully chose terms that are unprofessional nondescriptive unclinincal and full of sarcasm like we dont fucking know
socialism,not_removed,sorry but im against people who only pretend to care for the struggle
socialism,not_removed,at what point do you obtain the authority to make that decision especially in the narrative of people like mao zedong and maoists often called a counter revolutionary by certain groups yet was absolutely insanely and magnanimously popular with the chinese masses and at the center of their movement you know who is also insanely popular with the american masses donald trump this is not to make comparisons between the to but the masseswe dont fight for the masses or the people we fight for the proletariat achieve false consciousness all the time marxism is not a popularity contest so when one says without solidarity one can not be a socialist and in the same breath writes off millions of socialists as counter revolutionaries you have a situation of cognitive dissonance it should be selfevident as socialists that we stand in solidarity with the proletariat against the forces that oppress them and keep them from achieving their historic destiny these forces include not only imperialism and the government of the bourgeois as vulgar marxists try to reduce it to but their religious beliefs cultural norms moral systems and their ideology no matter how many red flags they wave maoism has proven both in its advocated actions and in its doctrines a counterrevolutionary ideology those who follow it are following a counterrevolutionary ideology edit i should say that maoism was not always counterrevolutionary it had its revolutionary place in completing the chinese transition to capitalism from semifeudalism should be highlighted but due to its statecapitalist nature is a counterrevolutionary ideology in relation to socialism and the victory of the proletariat at what point is one simply attempting to force their own definitions of socialism against the masses who have a different idea of socialism how is then being divorced from them being supportive of socialism no one is forcing their definition socialism against different ideas of socialism there is being revolutionary or counterrevolutionary and revolutionary in relation to what class and mode of production youre right in that you dont have to simply accept anyone who calls themselves socialist weeding all fakersliberalsetc is something that happens at all stratums of the movement the liberal problem is far overstated compared to the problem of marxists who believe in fundamentally counterrevolutionary ideologies
socialism,not_removed,i dont need any authority to come to a particular conclusion based on my research understanding knowledge and desires im also not a democrat and i care very little about popularity if the masses hold reactionary ideas im going to challenge those ideas because thats part of what educating the people entails
socialism,not_removed,racism exists now within both classes working and bourgeois however it started out as an ideology to justify the class relations between slaves and owners in this way it is inextricable from the class system it is also now upheld by forces that protect the ruling class police legislation etc and also serves to divide the working class against itself racism simply cannot be solved without smashing the class system that ensures its perpetuation is it not possible to have an economically classless society in which social forms of racial prejudice and discrimination take place yes but without a class structure and therefore institutions to protect that structure it would not be a systemic issue like it is under capitalism
socialism,not_removed,you cant have capitalism without racism malcolm x racism and specifically anti blackness as they exist now are very new phenomenon that were invented around years ago with the end of feudalism and the beginning of capitalism where land owners newly enriched by the enclosures sought to increase the surplus value accrued to them even more through the enslavement and free labor of one specific class of people in order to ideologically justify this they needed to produce a reason and this was racism alongside the various smaller internal justifications that propped it up specifically the inferiority of said race and religious duty of the white man to enslave him and assume his rightful evolutionary role on top all that fun new scientific darwinist racism even after the end of slavery in the west the ruling class still found it hugely useful to make use of the racist white supremacist narrative from centuries ago because it still allowed them to hyper exploit a large amount of the population use them as scapegoats for all the social ills produced by capitalist crisis and fragment the working class to prevent rebellion and this chronic long term hugely intentional material brutality and deprivation of liquid assets or resources is a major reason why black americans are so much poorer and discriminated against today because it was materially beneficial so yes race and class are fundamentally intertwined in a material relationship and it doesnt really make any sense to think of it in any other way why does racism make sense if not for someones benefit and if this benefit goes away and all the ideological trappings necessary to justify and naturalize said benefit were to even moderately fall away as a consequence why would racism continue to exist im not necessarily agreeing with this im just pushing back against the idealist argument that racism exists for seemingly no reason beyond white supremacy which is a tautology there has to be a material reason in place
socialism,not_removed,have you read the origins of family private property and the state
socialism,not_removed,i think in that sense using the word classism doesnt necessarily deny the fact that class is a material condition though if its coupled with other bourgeois feminist nonsense then of course it should be addressed as such its basically encouraging people not to think less of those who seem to be in a lower social class than they are in fact i think attacking classism can be a good place to get someone started on the road to socialism eg asking why do you think the poor remain poor then dismantling the classic arguments like the poor are lazy the poor are too stupid to save money etc once you get people to realize that poor people are a people just like them and b generally stuck in poverty for institutionalstructural reasons you can nudge them further in the right direction from there
socialism,not_removed,no dont worry i know youre not trying to be antagonistic essentially it comes down to the fact that percent of people who have an interest in leftism are introduced through heavily idpol anti class analysis groups typically on the internet which is hardly surprising a good number of these people do at some point genuinely adopt marxism or anarchism or some left political alignment but with very few exceptions they continue to view class as simply one star in the constellation of oppressionsprivileges instead of the central ultimate form its frankly hard to blame them because theyre mostly coming from sectarian groups on liberal arts college campuses but instead of say organizing against forced relocation of low income black communities for a mall or gentrified food strip it becomes eclipsed by constant infighting about oh how white and male privileged you are to believe you can speak on behalf of these people so nothing gets done ultimately but everyone celebrates about their petition its very much a young college student thing i think and its why im seeking out older worker led groups but theyre very difficult to find and get integrated with as im in such flux currently with school
socialism,not_removed,the focus on socialism is socialist communities is detrimental talking about socialism in socialist spaces detrimental is this not some extreme cognitive dissonance though why be a socialist if youre turned off by an emphasis on the very thing you identify with im sure there are spaces that are leftoriented to discuss ableism and disability but if you walk into an explicitly socialist space where they talk about socialism then get mad that theyre talking about the thing they said theyd talk about in the very name thats your own problem that being said i know a lot of my friends are into anarchocrp stuff if thats up your alley as it sounds like it might be and there are a number of online resources if youre looking to discuss that in depth
socialism,not_removed,rather a brocialist than a functional liberal eh
socialism,not_removed,its like my pa says if you meet an asshole on the train to work you met an asshole if you meet assholes all day long youre the asshole
socialism,not_removed,they are op coincidently enough
socialism,not_removed,woah genuinely had no idea the term sjw had this edgy alt right connotation here ive only ever seen it used pretty accurately to described the aforementioned privilege politics martyrs ive described throughout the thread i will keep that in mind
socialism,not_removed,thats the moment when i just stop reading the comment
socialism,not_removed,i m t i r e d a n d i w a n t t o g o t o b e d
socialism,not_removed,with respect to the question of what one gains by quoting marx i think this is a good question but one that can be reformulated by asking what are we quoting marx for this is the question of whether one attributes marxism normative or cognitive status ie whether we think it tells us something about causal relationships or whether we think it provides us with ideal forms of relations the difficulty seems to come when one tries to have some mixed form of this once you no longer accept marxs account of why the relations of production characteristic of the bourgoisie determine its superstructure then its no longer clear that one is entitled to speak of a hierarchical culture of the bourgeois as a monolithic entity as if hierarchy were a bourgeois phenomenon or a ruling class or bourgeois ideas what constitutes the unity of the bourgeoisie or its culture if not unidirectional determination by certain relations of production on the second question cultural hegemony is a position taken by gramsci and postgramscian theorists eg laclau and mouffe it is not doctrinaire marxism in part because it requires different causal accounts than classical marxist theory i dont see what we gain by calling it marxist when it is clearly a challenge to many fundamental tenets of marxs thought as for example laclaus work on populism makes clear
socialism,not_removed,ive listed a number of them below but sure heres a list of some that have somehow gained traction in circles im generally aware of recently tall privilege monosexual privilege the privilege that is having been serially assaulted and harassed because that means that men found you as a white woman desirable seriously with alarming frequency hot privilege vanilla not poly privilege shit like this pervades dialogue its absurd none of these are rooted in anything resembling a material disadvantage and dont fucking get me started on oh fake oppressions too cigarette smoker oppression cishet ace or aromantic oppression daddy dom oppression also is you saying im going to give you one chance you threatening to ban me i didnt realize until i checked another thread you were a mod
socialism,not_removed,i dont think its leftists who resort to the rhetoric of brocialism in all of the experiences i have seen though your experience may be different its obviously not a strawman as well because these liberals do exist and vastly outnumber socialists
socialism,not_removed,could you clarify your disagreement with identity politics and intersectionality
socialism,not_removed,you literally said gender is number on some vague list dumbass you explicitly laid out a hierarchy and are now accusing others of doing that
socialism,not_removed,sorry about the murder and rape and assault comrades i promise well take care of all that after the revolution
socialism,not_removed,the implication that trans people are just focused on their own struggles is disgusting and unsubstantiated their concerns are legitimate and should not be minimized as attention seeking
socialism,not_removed,do you call yourself a socialist without irony seriously how is sexism materialist in origin do men just exploit womens labor for fun did it fall from the sky or does it bequeath them tangible physical benefits control and power over resources does homophobia just fall from the sky or does it reinforce the nuclear family model and punish deviance that might upset the aforementioned that accrue to men as heads of household and property owners and the lineage that maintains this dynamic im not even going to touch this ussr comment for about reasons not least that that was specific to one regime and fully an ideological move this is precisely the nonsense im talking about
socialism,not_removed,also like yeah i guess im special in that im especially prone to intense rage episodes for no reason dissassociation and suicidality the language of specialness has always seemed disturbing to me precisely because it sounds like we are allowed to live and exist not because were human beings but because we have something that normies can use and exploit for their own benefit
socialism,not_removed,it should be selfevident as socialists that we stand in solidarity with the proletariat against the forces that oppress them and keep them from achieving their historic destiny these forces include not only imperialism and the government of the bourgeois as vulgar marxists try to reduce it to but their religious beliefs cultural norms moral systems and their ideology no matter how many red flags they wave mother jones campaigned on the basis that men should earn enough money to keep their wives at home to raise the kids capitalism vs sexism i think it was mother jones anyway i think of socialism as a placeholder for the world to come after capitalism and i think itll be easier to convince red state men to hate corporations than it is to convince them that women deserve jobs maybe there are some women who prefer that precapitalist role this is the classic feminist conundrum is it feminist to wear makeup one thing i know is that its not up to me to decide how socialism looks for them i dont have any illusions that the way i was brainwashed by my parents is inherently better than theirs
socialism,not_removed,again in unspecific terms educating people isnt this setting you up as an authority then what is authority without the understanding cooperation and association of people who through adoption of an idea make popularity an important quality it is the masses through their own experience understanding knowledge and desires who decide what is authoritative and authority and what isnt not a single source of opposition deciding otherwise if the masses hold reactionary ideas im going to challenge those ideas because thats part of what educating the people entails this is fair enough the masses are an imperfect thing and will make mistakes and should warrant criticism is your vanguardist approach here in opposition with the leftcompost left critique that education is totalitarianism again who decides at which juncture at what line in the sand that demarcates when a revolutionary has become a counter revolutionary when do the peasant chinese maoist revolutionaries of the the young and nascent proletarian chinese maoist revolutionaries of the late and the proletarian chinese maoists revolutionaries gunned down in transition from proletarian and peasant peasant revolutionaries into petite bourgeois counter revolutionaries is it still solidarity if someone and the working class are in opposition to specific methods or association with specific people ultimately everyone has said my experience says this my experience and idea is right your experience and idea is wrong
socialism,not_removed,it is the difference between a laymans racism meaning racial prejudice and an academics racism meaning institutional racism
socialism,not_removed,so yes race and class are fundamentally intertwined in a material relationship and it doesnt really make any sense to think of it in any other way why does racism make sense if not for someones benefit and if this benefit goes away and all the ideological trappings necessary to justify and naturalize said benefit were to even moderately fall away as a consequence why would racism continue to exist even if racisms root lays in capitalism which you did a very good job of explaining thank you is it not possible that in a sense that pandoras box has been opened that racist attitudes could still persist even in the face of anticapitalist movements what of other forms of social oppression how can we guarantee that the abolition of capitalism will bring about their end
socialism,not_removed,no but its on my reading list does it deal with this sort of subject matter
socialism,not_removed,i think this is the best case outcome but its really not what the entire ism of classism requires or even alludes to in the same sense that bourgeois feminism simply wants equality to exploit the proletariat with men the notion of classism in its bourgeois origin and context simply wants the poor and rich to be equal under the law and for them to blithely respect and smile at eachother in public while still holding onto the same power structures what youre suggesting is obviously the desirable outcome and its much faster and less painful to get there by trashing the ideology and going straight to a socialist understanding of exploitation
socialism,not_removed,i suppose thats also very true i normally think about classism in the contemporary sense but any society with economic classes could be one with classism in it
socialism,not_removed,is this not some extreme cognitive dissonance though why be a socialist if youre turned off by an emphasis on the very thing you identify with im sure there are spaces that are leftoriented to discuss ableism and disability but if you walk into an explicitly socialist space where they talk about socialism then get mad that theyre talking about the thing they said theyd talk about in the very name thats your own problem oh im sorry that i actually agree with workers of the world unite and feel that all issues people face should be discussed since theyre both used as tools for the capitalism and the state and because you know im a decent human being if socialism is incompatible with actually caring about actual people then i am not a socialist i was merely saying that socialists only talk about classrelated issues to the detriment of discussion about and people who are disabled queer trans coloured female etc im so sorry i want people to feel welcome in socialist spaces and to talk about these issues in a radical context im just weeping and clawing for forgiveness for not feel welcome when people act like issues other than capitalism and the state arent important because they are very important im sorry if i feel like puking when people complain about how the spooky sjws which are a spectre btw are telling them to not make minorities feel inhuman because they tell them not to use dehumanizing language this sub is a fucking pit of brocialism and all of you whining about sjws stealing your socialism need to realize you are exactly the same as wealthy sj activists who dont care about class a meme subreddit is better than this garbage pit a meme subreddit no wonder im forced to only care about memes at least then im not forced to deal with socialists who arent hypocrites who stop caring about oppressed people and helping them as soon as they realize it might reflect badly on them or as soon as they start using scary words like privilege or hey dont say that its dehumanizing this entire thread illustrates my point wonderfully you people say you care about materialism then realize there are actual concrete things that we have to deal with that we just happen to explain with theory other than socialism socialism isnt the endall beall of all discourse including socialist discourse edit yeah if youre offended about this its probably because its about you
socialism,not_removed,the scary authoritarian fascist leftists are at it again
socialism,not_removed,are you seriously claiming that people that dont match the propagandized standard of beauty and people that are gsrm arent oppressed by patriarchy and the gender binary their oppression is fake they have no material disadvantages
socialism,not_removed,as someone who frequents radfem spaces such as srs and speaks to radfems irl frequently considering myself in solidarity with them etc i have never heard any of those terms i have no fucking clue where you pulled those from other than possibly your ass
socialism,not_removed,you have been invited to talk on tv for an hour about the socialist movement how do you allocate your time boom youre ranking the issues this nonhierarchical view of things is completely detached from reality it is pure abstraction to me
socialism,not_removed,fuck you dont put words in his mouth im trans and im far terrified of capitalist enslavement of humakind than i am of someone using my proper pronouns or threatening me with pain over something cant control umandragara is completely right on this and makes very good point either address his arguments or fuck off
socialism,not_removed,thats not what im saying at all youre either skimreading my replies or intentionally misreading them
socialism,not_removed,sexism is rooted from the agricultural revolution i remember reading a book about it forgot the name though sexism indeed has materialist roots
socialism,not_removed,teaching someone doesnt give me authority over them it would be authority if i ordered people to do things and they were bound to do it simply imparting my knowledge and opinions on other people does not bound them to my perspective i dont consider this to be a vanguardist position that i am taking and im neither a leftcom or a postleftist so i cant comment on that part im not interested in any line in the sand socialists were opposed and put forward their reasons to the ussr and prc long before they ever crossed any line their critiques of these countries changed little over time
socialism,not_removed,you know its actually kinda funny to me i came to socialism from identity politics so i was familiar with a lot of this stuff before i had a class analysis to link it all together that distinction academic vs colloquial which i argued for many times still never actually had a class component to it at least it certainly was never explained to me like i now understand it as being completely intertwined with marxist classes the funny part is how useful yet elusive back then i have found class analysis as a lens for explaining and putting into context these complex social relations
socialism,not_removed,for sure you dont just get rid of racist beliefs and behaviors overnight because ideology is a nasty virus to shake and heres where i dont subscribe to the belief that the elimination of class society would end white supremacy just like that the problem is i dont really know what the answer is obviously the most important step eliminating class society and then i guess with great force and power you begin restructuring the ideological apparatuses not just schools and media sources but basic family and neighborhood structures as well to reflect the genuinely egalitarian and rightheaded nature of a newly non hierachal society it would take time obviously and there are clearly superstructural features that would need to be intentionally tackled but so much of racism is directly nestled in with issues of extreme poverty and legacies of destitution that one literally cant smash white supremacism without first destroying capitalism in regard to misogyny and homophobia its a little different obviously because those oppressions have different material origins purposes and actual lengths of existence patriarchy is arguably the absolute oldest social organizer and its grip is almost complete and fully pervades not only the work place and store but the home family and all relationships so even an equal workplace wouldnt preclude the likelihood that extremely as symmetric household and child rearing models wouldnt continue so different solutions for different features but the key thing is the equitable redistribution of resources and the elimination of an owner class
socialism,not_removed,working class struggle is a cleansing fire for oppressive ideologies when workers struggle together they realize they are comrades because they live under the same imposed austerity and domination by the bourgeoisie and naturally question their hatred of each other also if you want to read more about this they are members of the cwi if i remember correctly
socialism,not_removed,completely its by engels deals with the issue of womens oppression in the household by men and is arguably the first socialist feminist piece he jumps to some wrong conclusions but its strong throughout definitrly required reading
socialism,not_removed,its a must read on this subject matter engles is just the fucking man
socialism,not_removed,no one said it was incompatible with caring about people just that if youre alienated by talking about the very thing you identify with maybe you should find a different space rsocialism is full of socialist identity politics conversations so is revleftcom so is any reading or feminist group you can find in any moderately sized american city so are a huge number of online blogging communities theyre everywhere and id really like to encounter these classexclusive leftists yall are all talking about because i find them on leftypol and nowhere else so lets trade
socialism,not_removed,can you give some examples of brocialism youve seen in this sub im here a lot and barely see it and if there is any the mods are very quick at calling it out
socialism,not_removed,this thread is dangerous to my health
socialism,not_removed,if they do its not because of hot privilege but because of white centric heteronormative beauty standards see those are real privileges and oppressions hot or tall as stand alones are not those arent coherent real privileges even though people still materially suffer from being disfigured or unattractive or whatever have you in such a capacity that they dont meet normative beauty standards see the difference thats privilege politics vs useful analysis
socialism,not_removed,srs is definitely the antithesis of radfem unless youre saying radical feminist in the general lefty feminist way and not the theoretically demarcated pure radical feminism of andrea dworkin and ilk from the they were pulled from the asss of the main people who lead and populate these groups i dont really know how to convince any of you that those have been deployed with success recently in the circles i either observe am on the borders of or am actively involved in to my major annoyance
socialism,not_removed,socialist hierarchical rankings pick one anyway the choice youre presenting is a false one its almost like youre the one playing oppression olympics ironically and i highly doubt you spend so much time trying to dismantle capitalism that youve no time left to advocate for the basic humanity of your trans comrades
socialism,not_removed,he isnt completely right and stop with your rasatrans reactionary line you are not my sisterbrother not if you think like that you are not my comrade i have been shot stabbed raped beaten drugged and hospitalized all because i am trans take your petit bourgeois liberalism somewhere else you sellout
socialism,not_removed,socialism is by definition rooted in a dialectical materialist understanding of exploitation and class struggle you can disagree with people all you want about the extent to which class misogyny racism etc predate or supercede or trump one another but youre not a socialist if you employ idealist cultural arguments about where they come from the nuclear family is a product of the ideological superstructure which emerges from the material economic base as the economic base shifts and transforms as it did from feudalism to capitalism so too does the ideological superstructure in its various manifestations to serve the needs of capital accumulation and survival
socialism,not_removed,it also says right in the side board that its expected youll have a modicum of familiarity with socialist thought if you post here if you like im more than happy to post some literature about this when im on break but its not elitist to ask someone about very fundamental issues of socialist thought and theory
socialism,not_removed,i guess with great force and power you begin restructuring the ideological apparatuses not just schools and media sources but basic family and neighborhood structures as well the name for this is cultural revolution congratulations you may be a maoist
socialism,not_removed,i can definitely agree with that approach
socialism,not_removed,thanks ill try getting around to it sooner rather than later
socialism,not_removed,im not alienated by talking about socialism as i thought should be exceptionally clear to you but evidently imagining everyone you argue with is some irrational whiner is easier im alienated by people not actually caring about identity politics when it has actual concrete effects on me im alienated by inadequate discussion of identity politics revleftcom is full of stalinapologists so no rsocialism is full of conversations about identity politics only if you ignore the vast majority of discussions here and if its so hard for you to realize im complaining about people who refuse to reflect on or give serious thought to identity politics not classexclusivists tell me why do you think my view of the world is so black and white
socialism,not_removed,its hard to find specific examples to link to because its not like i keep a text document with permalinks to every brocialist comment i notice although as said looking through this thread theres some blatant examples wherein people whine about buzzwords and people telling them to not us dehumanizing language usually framing it as anticlass struggle because apparently people can only care about one thing at a time or maybe because theyve mainly seen liberals talk about it and of course liberals arent going to care about class struggle anyways though examples can be found what a surprise theyre a cishet guy so they did just mansplain what brocialism is this sort of thing about sjew witch hunts is literally the shit trump supporters say this is literally shit trump supporters say unsurprisingly the only people who arent yelling at strawpeople ie sjws are downvoted somewhat unrelated but this minithread would be really great for sts so im saving it here criticism is blackandwhite liberalism yet again a hardly surprising example of mls saying everyone they disagree with is a liberal and that tankie is a meaningless pretty hypocritical considering they love calling the actual socialists liberals ignorance of what ive never seen it used as a generic insult this is like thedonald telling us straw sjws make fascist meaningless it is used outside of its general definition yes but it is in fact used for a difficult to define problem im not sure how to explain it but take my word for it okay im really seeing an overlap between tankie arguments and brocialist arguments at this point if its so difficult for you to understand these are actually existing problems that will effect people before the revolution too im willing to protest and strike and even take up arms with a brocialist on truly common goals however i am not going to let their ignorance andor bigotry sit if im going to be around them regularly this continues on and on for my feeling about there being a general lack of discussion about identity politics simply look at the front page for a few pages and youll see that class politics dominate and that the threads that are about identity politics tend to focus on some struggles more than others i see very little to no discussion of ableism for example despite the fact that its so pervasive that almost all insults originate from terms for disabled people and how clearly and deeply harms us economically and a clear relationship to class to name only a few problems
socialism,not_removed,seriously it looks like anything that toes the line of ambiguous just gets banned no questions asked i see absolutely none
socialism,not_removed,i have never seen eg a poly person be so narcissistic that they think that their oppression is entirely unique and that they are somehow detached from the consequences of the larger normative systems to be honest the concept of tallhot privilege seems like something diametrically conjured up between rredpill and leftypol
socialism,not_removed,in my experience the modern definition of radfeminism is essentially a socialistnonliberal outtake on feminism and advocates the complete destruction of the patriarchy all of the examples you pulled sound rather suspiciously like a trumpfucks vision of feminism
socialism,not_removed,and stop with your rasatrans reactionary line all because i am trans things i hate the fact that i have to play the asatrans thing but if i dont mention that suddenly my opinion suddenly gets invalidated which just a stupid thing in of itself you literally used the same trans guilt i used im sorry but thats hypocritical no matter how you look at it im sorry such illwill has befallen you but it is because of the capitalist hegemony and its constant attempts to divide the working classjustify class relations that have created the material existence in which we are persecuted i go to church with people whove beaten me in an alleyway and done much the same things that happened to you just because weve oppressed as a community doesnt mean that our oppression matters more than the class relation that established this existence in the first place
socialism,not_removed,diatmat is a revision of marxist dialectics just sayin
socialism,not_removed,oh i dont think i realized this was supposed to be offensive i dig maoism and all my smart friends are maoists so same question
socialism,not_removed,ive actually been looking into maoism very recently as most of my rev friends are solidly in that camp are you one and if so any recommendations
socialism,not_removed,why are you framing this as if im some sociopathic shitlord cishet white dude i literally say in the main post that im a gay multiply mentally ill woman im just as unwelcome in this brocialist caravan as you are and am just as directly impacted by identity politics as you are chill out where did i say it was black and white seriously show me where in my post i ever said this and show me where i ever said that specific oppressive strains werent real or people need to bugger off with their special snowflake identities because i dont care about their general safety or well being and actually hate them and want them dead because im a big bad brocialist i dont even know what youre trying to argue with my anymore
socialism,not_removed,okay so i totally agree that a lot of those comments are problematicfor lack of a better word but apart from a fewthe ones mocking white privilege and a few more downplaying identity politics i dont think id call them examples of brocialism as much as just severely lacking in understanding the prevalence of racismhomophobiaetc in modern world countries and also lacking in understanding how they directly correlate to class struggle i guess we might have different definitions of brocialism but for me its more socialists who oppose discussion on social justice issues and not just socialists who obviously dont understand it those types of people can be educated but people who claim to be socialists yet oppose feminism for instance are far more dangerous because like berniebros it is obvious that theyre using the socialist cause strictly for person gain like theyll benefit from smashing capitalism but not patriarchy so they dont care about it or want the spotlight on the issues that benefit them most so i think the word is overused a bit or has become a bit ambiguous but at the same time thats not to say that the comments you linked to dont have issues and errors in them that need to be called out
socialism,not_removed,then youre in a much luckier political and social location than i am because that is a commonly stated view
socialism,not_removed,the modern definition of radical feminism is radical feminism its still a discrete body of theory unto itself from wikipedia radical feminism is a perspective within feminism that calls for a radical reordering of society in which male supremacy is eliminated in all social and economic contexts radical feminists seek to abolish patriarchy by challenging existing social norms and institutions rather than through a purely political process this includes challenging the notion of traditional gender roles opposing the sexual objectification of women and raising public awareness about such issues as rape and violence against women main leaders were dworkin mackinnon wittig raymond its not explicitly socialist though dworkin and pals were in their youth socialists but its pretty much exclusively focused on the destruction of patriarchy and patriarchy as the crucial origin of all oppressive structures so its a flipflop from marxist feminism regardless i know srs doesnt fuck with radical feminism because its so drenched with massive transphobia and essentialism i would also love to believe this lunacy doesnt actually spring from anywhere but the imaginations of the right but its extremely common if youre not on or near college campuses you probably dont get exposed to it very much but its all i hear in the echo chamber
socialism,not_removed,radical feminism is definitely not simply nonliberal feminism and in many ways radical feminism has been at odds with socialist feminism op is correct that youre not using the term correctly think second wave feminists like dworkin greer firestone anyway ive absolutely seen the things that op is talking about in my city theyve often come from the spusa and its one of the reasons i quit that party
socialism,not_removed,yeah lol because the fascists who called me a tranny faggot when they gunned me down in front of my friends house were so concerned with dialectical materialism capitalism the hegemony of capital and class consciousness leftism fuck outta here
socialism,not_removed,like i said im happy to dig around marxists dot com and find you some texts about materialism if youre interested in reading them but thats not what it sounds like if youre learning about socialism its in your best interest to get familiar with basic terminology and concepts
socialism,not_removed,you dont need to be a socialist to fight for socialist nor do you need to convert everyone to socialism to achieve socialism
socialism,not_removed,cool im aware this is rsocialism not an inconsequential talk with a liberal friend about capitalism outside my dorm dont come to a subreddit that explicitly calls for familiarity with the topic and front like you know stuff then huffily backtrack and call other people elitists when you reveal you dont ill drop links in the original post for anyone whos interested
socialism,not_removed,friendly reminder that even if the fascist doesnt argue in good faith its still beneficial to overturn their arguments call out their bullshit for the benefit of the audience dont give people reasons to nod along with a fascist even if they find them morally repulsive
socialism,not_removed,why not both
socialism,not_removed,honest challenge give me one good reason i have several of my own but i want to see yours i want to see a person with your post history make a cogent argument against violence
socialism,not_removed,given vargs history id rather not
socialism,not_removed,if you use violence you admit that you lost the fight before it began if violence itself is bad of racist murderer varg vikernes and if youre in favor of openly defending your ideas why is your post history full of cases where you surely if you truly believe in your ideals you should be able to state them plainly on your own terms i mean if im coming to the very reasonable conclusion that youre a disingenuous liar then your argument about free speech doesnt make much sense since its couched in the idea that we should be making genuine arguments to reach a rational conclusion not in any inherent value of free speech itself and if your reason doesnt work then you dont have a case and if you dont have a case then its pretty much acceptable to kill you at least according to your own value system if anything itd be survival of the fittest which im sure is a concept youve jerked off to a couple dozen times
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,its because of the word filter it happened automatically i saw it in my replies anyways
socialism,not_removed,nah we went through this you couldnt give me a solid reason without degenerating into hypocrisy so you cant complain when people hurt or even
socialism,not_removed,stop wanting to hurt people who want to hurt people for their race gender ethnicity etc no thanks fascist scum are not innocent
socialism,not_removed,please explain in your own ideological terms why anyone should care how you feel again i have reasons but i want to hear yours
socialism,not_removed,leftist actually think that everyone who disagrees with them is a nazi nah only the nazis
socialism,not_removed,lick my boot
socialism,not_removed,because of varg vikernes the meme guy thats so weird see invoking varg vikernes is almost the opposite of your argument so i mean youre basically just outright admitting that according to an altrighter theres no genuine reason to care about your feelings or even any reason not to commit violence against them so like thanks i guess i mean like i said i have several reasons to be concerned about feelings and oppose violence but its all based in empathy and other shit you dont care about but the rest of these folks man they were raised on indiana jones and wolfenstein and they have been chomping at the bit for a reason pretty much their entire lives so your admissions probably gonna make them feel a lot better so thanks for that honestly
socialism,not_removed,an odious woman she along with reagan has been one of the most damaging forces to society both in britain and in the world since the end of the second world war
socialism,not_removed,she said the same thing to pol pot too
socialism,not_removed,reagan invited them to the white house and dedicated the challenger shuttle to them the photos are jarring
socialism,not_removed,i see ziaulhaq present a reactionary tyrant with the blood of millions on his hands he helped fund the contras in afghanistan and played a vital role in putting down the black september insurgency at least he did not die a natural death
socialism,not_removed,we should exhume her corpse and shit in her skull
socialism,not_removed,post it my god hahaha
socialism,not_removed,lady thatcher always kept the best company these are freedom fighters dont you see
socialism,not_removed,not to mention the havoc he wreaked on india and pakistan
socialism,not_removed,a staunch liberal given a private funeral paid for by the public we should force bankers to dig her up and drop a house on her corpse
socialism,not_removed,respect cows not thatcher
socialism,not_removed,dont use sexist language
socialism,not_removed,i believe they are referring to
socialism,not_removed,i found

socialism,not_removed,true
socialism,not_removed,this is mumbai and even if this image is shopped theres no dearth of this exact situation or worse playing out all through the city for the curious theres also that antila monstrosity that our very own super rich have created reportedly the richest private residence in the world in the country with the largest population of people living below the poverty line
socialism,not_removed,is this a real photo if so where is this thanks in advance
socialism,not_removed,according to snopes it is a real photo httpwwwsnopescomtrumptowerbillboardinmumbai
socialism,not_removed,this reminds me of a
socialism,not_removed,as disgusting as we all know trump is this picture is shopped hes still a monster without fabricating the truth
socialism,not_removed,pretty clearly not shopped
socialism,not_removed,the people rooting around in filth werent there at the exact moment the picture was taken so its phony
socialism,not_removed,everyone in the rpics thread claims its photoshopped
socialism,not_removed,yes it is it is a billboard from trump tower in mumbai xpost rpics
socialism,not_removed,apparently its real httpwwwsnopescomtrumptowerbillboardinmumbai
socialism,not_removed,his running an ad campaign in mumbai that a photographer later used as a contrast shot makes trump a bad person
socialism,not_removed,this could be a picture taken at a later date when they began cleaning up for the tower edit actually your photo is further proof that this picture is real httpsiimgurcomcigddlfpng part of your picture that is showed in the op notice the little hut cleaned up as well as the plants in the front of the building the person standing in front of the door looks like a security guard probably making sure no homeless loiter in the area just like what is done by the trump tower in nyc
socialism,not_removed,snopes says it is real httpwwwsnopescomtrumptowerbillboardinmumbai
socialism,not_removed,why not gimped gimp is more akin to socialism than photoshop photoshop is pure capitalism gimp is the peoples response i like to think this was gimped not shoppedtrade
socialism,not_removed,probably not though anyway theres no shortage of homeless in mumbai and this billboard is definitely there whats so unbelievable about this
socialism,not_removed,no the fact hes a reactionary bourgeoise pig who perpetuates the system of global capitalism which leads to situations seem like the one in the picture
socialism,not_removed,the people claiming its shopped say that its there and so is the wall but the stuff on the streets is photoshopped i saw a pic they linked but i cant find the thread anymore to put it in my comment
socialism,not_removed,lol there is nothing bourgeoise about trump his supporters otoh
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,trump not bourgeoisie what
socialism,not_removed,what do you mean trump employs people
socialism,not_removed,what do you think bourgeoisie means
socialism,not_removed,this isnt prerevolutionary france
socialism,not_removed,bourgeoisie as middle class seems a bit outdated
socialism,not_removed,its a pretty shoddy mask at that its just another way the morally bankrupt liberal elites try to win elections they cant respond rationally to the economic social and political stresses that are happening in the country and in their infinite hubris feel the need to revive a long dead mindset just to rationalize their own corruption
socialism,not_removed,i think the reason he called it defeatist is because the concept of permanent revolution is used as an argument that you shouldnt work towards revolution in the now reactionary might be taking it to far maoists much like all marxists still believe in an international revolution its not like they just isolated themselves i think maos concept of permanent revolution is pretty interesting he basically believed that you need a new revolution after every revolution to not stagnate or regress back into capitalism he even says that its not to be confused with the trotskyite one of course this only makes sense if you accept the second internationals and lenins definition of socialism as opposed to marx and engels definition
socialism,not_removed,how is acknowledging that the revolution has to be international defeatist and reactionary socialism can only be achieved through international revolution i wouldnt worry about it
socialism,not_removed,what happens if country y per example implements a labour voucher system and breaks with capital circulation what happens to a country that breaks with capitalism but hasnt yet reached a stateless society but has reached a classless and moneyless society is it a pettybourgeois elite society where the wealth and the means of production are shared but there isnt a international revolution so they arent socialists
socialism,not_removed,i think all marxists would agree that socialism can not be fully realized and that the state cant wither away without a global revolution i think he meant internally maos stance on revolution as opposed to the marxistleninist one is that they have to make their own revolution of course china still supported other revolutions but unlike ussr they didnt export revolution china even kicked out all the ussr officials mao also blamed the fact that the ussr tried to export its economic model to cuba for its problems maoism doesnt move on from socialism in one country because it was never really a part of maoism the whole socialism in one country was a concept stalin created that just supposed to be applied to the ussr at the time in a more general sense you could summarize it to that mao believed that people can only make revolution where they areie the people in china cant really make revolution for the people in sweden and so on and you cant export a revolution because the material conditions are different putting focus on the peasantry made sense in china but it wouldnt in a country like sweden and so on he also believed that one socialist country shouldnt be dependent on another and that there should be mutual support
socialism,not_removed,you have to do what it takes reaching berlin korea like the ussr did reaching angola south africa and namibia like cuba did the revolution is international and the next big marxist country needs to go further
socialism,not_removed,in the mlm group im in the general consensus is that you can only do revolution at home but that you can still aidsupport other revolutions we have a group that serves as a solidarity group for the naxalites and so on there also used to be a somewhat big solidarity group for the peruvian peoples war aid but dont intervene or control
socialism,not_removed,i think a lot of resentment against trots is because of their practice like the whole supporting social democratic candidates selling newspappers taking over movements and showing up to demonstrations with large flags and newspapers only to take a few photos and leave at least from what ive seen i hope one day trots and maoists walk hand in hand to destroy the bourgies i personally think that these things wont matter when revolution comes because revolution is driven by the masses and not ideology or ideas
socialism,not_removed,no one said he was a socialist but his reforms are to be studied so if a government for proletarians is instituted we can learn from figures such as this i also believe the only fascist he aligned to was coughlin which i dont believe he explicitly said he was aligned to him but i am aware of their relationship as friends also he said communism in that quote the intent of his policies doesnt matter it should be measured by its assistance to the working class economically he was called a dictator only by corporations and eliminated the poll tax to increase democracy in the state of louisiana i feel us as socialists are dismissing this figure to quickly he should be especially important to reformists
socialism,not_removed,well for one there is a reason huey opposed fdr and its because he didnt go far enough but yes there is nothing wrong with studying the policy of figures throughout history to further the cause of socialism
socialism,not_removed,oh whos the revolutionary who lives under the sea vladimir lenin ruthless and cunning and sneaky is he vladimir lenin if bolshevik revolution be something you wish vladimir lenin then kill the tsar and gut him like a fish vladimir lenin ready vladimir lenin vladimir lenin vladimir lenin hahaha ahahahah ahh
socialism,not_removed,if because of technological development the working class becomes redundant wouldnt the elite prefer to kill us than support us they dont hesitate to kill large numbers when it benefits them and as long as were around theres always risk of a revolution isnt basic income just a scheme to keep us docile in the meantime when our only longterm hope is an end to capitalism
socialism,not_removed,as forbes put it finland through the prime ministers office has been pioneering a form of deciding upon public policy where people actually think through the problems at issue think about them consider solutions test a few of them then implement the best if forbes is satisfied with the finnish government is not a good sign
socialism,not_removed,not much would change if finland started basic income everyone unemployed in finland already gets unemployment benefits and their income would not go up this would just make it easier to get the unemployed to work low paying jobs because they wouldnt lose their benefits
socialism,not_removed,while i think its a fundamentally good idea i suspect that when neoliberal nations implement basic income its just so they can slash welfare more easily
socialism,not_removed,welfare is the transition into just that situation its so easy to revoke welfare and once the workers have no power all rights will be revoked
socialism,not_removed,interesting view thanks for sharing your thoughts
socialism,not_removed,welfare is the subsidation of exploration
socialism,not_removed,isnt that not necessarily a bad thing though they get more money and even if the job is low paying at least some of the jobs can be socially valuable and people can have some social interaction and increase their selfworth obviously id prefer better paying jobs that are definitely socially valuable but someone getting the equivalent of unemployment plus a low wage job is a bit better psychologically than just unemployment
socialism,not_removed,isnt that the point
socialism,not_removed,its a socdem plaster over the real issue of low wages and high unemployment its not real change its just further entrenchment into a welfare state and while a good idea its hardly a step in the right direction
socialism,not_removed,this ultimately depends on what you believe constitutes a state do you consider any organisation used to enforce the position of a specific class as the ruling class to be a state rojava i mean thats still a form of a state how would we even suppress the bourgeoisie by seizing their property and stopping any of their attempts to stop the proletarian revolution here do we draw the line between an upper class family and the bourgeoisie class is dependent on ones relation to private property not wealth is anarchism the way to go i mean it depends on what you mean by this i believe that the anarchist movement is very important in greece but i wouldnt say that being an anarchist personally is generally the way to go
socialism,not_removed,reading your post there is a lot that betrays youre really really new to these ideas and havent absorbed them if classes are eliminated there cannot be a state a bourgeois state suppresses the proletariat a proletarian state suppresses the bourgeoisie the state is an artifact of class you need to go back and dig a bit deeper and figure out what all the marxists are talking about when they say class and state before you can come to an informed opinion on either
socialism,not_removed,it seems like you agree with marxs conclusions but dont understand the methods he used to reach them—dialectical and historical materialism marx and marxists dont simply go hey the state would be useful for counterrevolutionaries lets use it or capitalism is bad lets try to end it understanding the why ie the theory is where you should start
socialism,not_removed,the state is inherently oppressive nobody is disagreeing with you there so long as the state exists there is no freedom when there is freedom there will be no state lenin the state revolution i understand that the state is supposed to suppress the bourgeoisie but how can that work if classes are eliminated in socialism socialism can only exist in the absence of class society before we can establish socialism we first need to abolish the bourgeoisie and the proletariat by communising the means of production this does not happen over night nor does it happen every where at once during the period between the capture of political power by the proletariat and the abolition of class society and the establishment of socialism there will be a period where the bourgeois still exist and it is necessary for the proletariat to organise themselves into a political force capable of defeating their class enemies—this political organisation takes the form of the state how would we even suppress the bourgeoisie by appropriating their property and preventing them from organising as a political force capable of reestablishing capitalism where do we draw the line between an upper class family and the bourgeoisie the bourgeoisie is anyone who owns the means of production is anarchism the way to go i use to think so then i realised it was necessary for the proletariat to organise themselves into a force capable of suppressing the bourgeois for the revolution to be successful and that any attempt at establishing anarchism has resulted in the dictatorship of the proletariat—thus proving marx right even lenin agreed that anarchism was the end goal we do not after all differ with the anarchists on the question of the abolition of the state as the aim we maintain that to achieve this aim we must temporarily make use of the instruments resources and methods of state power against the exploiters just as the temporary dictatorship of the oppressed class is necessary for the abolition of classes lenin the state revolution
socialism,not_removed,states are repressive but worked for the bourgeoisie and they used and still use states too to repress the still strong monarchi and aristocratic classes they overthrew and now the workers movement i see that claim to be rhethorical more than analytical
socialism,not_removed,would you agree that if the state seizes bourgeois property then state bureaucrats become the de facto bourgeoisie
socialism,not_removed,organisation used to enforce the position of a specific class as the ruling class this seems vague to me an organization used to enforce the position of a specific class as the ruling class i think could be a state or not it does not seem to inherently signify a state
socialism,not_removed,it reminds me of my anarchist days i usually recommend socialism utopian or scientific for people who are at that level of understanding as thats the text which ultimately helped me the most curious if you know of any better works for introducing radical leftists to marxism
socialism,not_removed,lets not pretend that dialectical materialism is some actual ironclad technique of analysis its a technique of applying historical narratives to the present which has rather limited value within any society there are dozens of large societal contradictions which could be viewed as dominant by different observers and could plausibly in large part lead to the formation of a new society the only thing that allows a given set of valid contradictions to be picked out that actually seem to work within the framework are broad interpretation and the hindsight that historical analysis allows marx and marxists dont simply go hey the state would be useful for counterrevolutionaries lets use it or capitalism is bad lets try to end it marx and his clique in bonn did in fact think that capitalism was bad and want to end it long before any of the analysis was applied he applied this analysis knowing the conclusions he wanted to reach and managed to successfully reach that conclusion lets not pretend that this is scientific history so far has shown marxs analysis based upon dialectics to be rather lacking it did not predict the rise of fascism it failed to predict how capitalism would develop or how bourgeois democracy would exist as something counter to proletarian revolution rather than helpful to it it disregarded the peasantry as a revolutionary class towards the establishment of communism when in many cases they played a huge role etc there are kludgey fixes to try to make his dialectic work and predict the future despite repeated past failures at doing so but these are ultimately futile attempts to back up unscientific dogma tldr marx provided amazing analysis of the political economy but his why for his revolutionary theory revolved around shoehorning a popular metaphysical theory of the day into materialism and pretending it is a predictive model his why for proceeding how he thought the working class ought to proceed was probably the least valuable part of his analysis
socialism,not_removed,do you have any good links to where i can understand the theory
socialism,not_removed,even lenin agreed that anarchism was the end goal we do not after all differ with the anarchists on the question of the abolition of the state as the aim anarchy and antistate are not the same thing
socialism,not_removed,if lenin didnt disagree with anarchists then why did kronstadt happen
socialism,not_removed,yes
socialism,not_removed,marx provided amazing analysis of the political economy what theory and philosophy ultimately guided his analysis dialectical and historical materialism
socialism,not_removed,dialectics is about predicting the future ebin meme fam
socialism,not_removed,lenins is essential reading on the subject of well the state and revolution
socialism,not_removed,that depends on how familiar you are with marxist thought but id suggest following using the httpswwwmarxistsorgarchiveindexhtm for reading the actual texts however since mias documents are better formatted than edit judging from your replies to others about lenins state and revolution which i anticipated id recommend engles socialism utoptian or scientific without understanding the the backgroundbasics it definitely feels like oppressive bullshit but thats sort of the nature of capitalist societys hegemony and indoctrination early in my journey i had to recognize that if something aligned with my preconceived views and values it probably isnt revolutionary and a result of my own liberal indoctrination nbsp these two quotes helped me a lot no one is going to give you the education you need to overthrow them nobody is going to teach you your true history teach you your true heroes if they know that that knowledge will help set you free ― assata shakur we should support whatever the enemy opposes and oppose whatever the enemy supports ― mao tse tung with regard to the mao quote and some of what i said it is also extremely important to not be dogmatic and blindly support or believe any and everything which capitalists are against too many comrades fall into that trap unfortunately
socialism,not_removed,the state and revolution is a good starting point
socialism,not_removed,exuse my french but historical materialism is bullshit as most of economics is as an anarchist you should understrand that i recommend reading httpdwardmacpitzereduanarchistarchiveskropotkinsciencetochtml httpslibcomorglibrarytowardanthropologicaltheoryvaluefalsecoinourowndreams
socialism,not_removed,thats why i put anarchism in quotations
socialism,not_removed,for lots of reasons not lenin hated anarchists nothing is that simple he agreed on end goals but disagreed on how to get there
socialism,not_removed,waging an insurrection against a state threatened by inside and outside pressures is usually thought not to be the best way not to be repressed
socialism,not_removed,kronstadt was a working class uprising it had support from anarchists what few there were not dead or in prison in russia at the time but it was not some revolution by anarchists neither was the russian revolution a revolution by bolsheviks
socialism,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchviqakuanmjji if you are interested in learning about the kronstadt rebellion from the perspective of an ml i would recommend watching this lecture
socialism,not_removed,it doesnt seem very useful since it could apply to so many different kind of things from a full on dictatorship to a looselyconnected band of militias
socialism,not_removed,sure and you can make good analysis guided by poor theories and philosophies freuds work was bullshit but he founded the field of psychotherapy and his work resulted in practical techniques that have helped millions i dont have to believe that the psyche is construct of the conflict between id ego and superego to see that sitting down and talking to people about the stressors and conflicts in their life is helpful marxs theoretical basis wasnt nearly as bad as freuds of course historical materialism is a good framework for viewing human development and when used as a historical lens i would even say that marxs dialectic has some value generalizations which can be made about history are fantastic for understanding how society currently operates and why society is the way it is but problems clearly arise when one decides that these generalizations are the only thing that ever happened the only thing that can happen and the only thing that will continue to happen
socialism,not_removed,he provided an analysis of the political economy of century the question of how much of it is valuable now is very debatable thing
socialism,not_removed,youre saying that marx makes no claim at all based upon dialectics about what type of revolution will happen who will drive that revolution and what will follow that revolution
socialism,not_removed,but thats all leninist shit
socialism,not_removed,im unfamiliar with any anarchist refutations of historical materialism would you mind sharing some do anarchists reject class struggle being the driving force of revolution and thus societys progression thats not rhetorical by the way
socialism,not_removed,we can make a distinction between states that serve the interests of different classes ie bourgeois state and the dictatorship of the proletariat
socialism,not_removed,sure he makes claims about those but they arent conclusions reached through the dark magic of dialectical prognostication they are conclusions arrived at by actually witnessing workers attempting to overthrow capitalism
socialism,not_removed,so if you want to learn more about the function of the state in socialism you cant avoid lenin
socialism,not_removed,i want to understand authoritarian socialists but i dont want to like read the seminal text
socialism,not_removed,sorry i thought cmv meant change my view not im not going to listen to any ideas that conflict with my own
socialism,not_removed,okay even if you disagree with it shouldnt you read it anyway so you know what it is you disagree with because its incredibly influencential
socialism,not_removed,but even in a bourgeois state some capitalists are given preferential treatment over others because the interests of the state are tied to the collective interests of the capitalists leading often enough to state repression of some capitalists such as martin shkreli i am left with no other reason but to assume that a dictatorship of the proletariat serving the interests of the working class would serve the interest of the collective working class thereby leading to state sponsored repression of individual workers as the experience of actually existing socialism shows us so i guess i have two questions why is repression of the working class necessary for their liberation and assuming it is why would it be something worth fighting for
socialism,not_removed,why not lenins ideas have only resulted in shitty dictatorships not to mention the state revolution was more of a pr move by lenin rather than his actual beliefs
socialism,not_removed,i have already read half of it
socialism,not_removed,and what are the interests of the collective working class other than a reflection of the individual interests of workers as the experience of actually existing socialism shows us do you honestly consider the ussr to have been a dictatorship of the proletariat why is repression of the working class necessary for their liberation repression of the working class by who the working class itself why would it be something worth fighting for the dictatorship of the proletariat is the logical conclusion of a successful proletarian insurrection the proletariat must become the ruling class in order to abolish private property and therefore abolish itself as a class
socialism,not_removed,only once you will have analyzed the past will you be able to understand the depth of his thought understanding the ussrs relative failure is important dismissing marxismleninism on this basis is ignorant
socialism,not_removed,lenins ideas have only resulted in shitty dictatorships debatable the state revolution was more of a pr move by lenin rather than his actual beliefs loooooool seriously seems as though you know diddly squat about lenin or his works why the fuck would lenin write such a complex book just for pr that makes no sense lenins ideas behind the function of the state withering away of the state and the dictatorship of the proletariat are all crucial to understanding marxist theory and all those ideas didnt come into being because of pr reasons
socialism,not_removed,if youre not willing to even crack the state and the revolution during a cmv post about the statess role in revolution then you really need to delete this because youre wasting everybodys time the book is one of the most concise explanations of the exact theoretical ideas that you seem to be missing
socialism,not_removed,sorry but i must disagree with you the state revolution is a good book on how marxists view the state even if i dont like some parts of it or if i dont like lenin as a person
socialism,not_removed,read the other half then
socialism,not_removed,and what are the interests of the collective working class other than a reflection of the individual interests of workers ive already showed how the interests of the collective capitalist are sometimes opposed to individual capitalists all youre doing is claiming the individual doesnt matter do you honestly consider the ussr to have been a dictatorship of the proletariat some people do repression of the working class by who the working class itself i guess if the bourgeois state represses some of the bourgeoisie than i guess they are being repressed by the bourgeoisie itself the proletariat must become the ruling class in order to abolish private property and therefore abolish itself as a class the proletariat can abolish private property by simply not working refusing the orders of the bosses and producing for themselves they dont need to become a ruling class for this and they dont need a state
socialism,not_removed,if the ussr failed not because of the way it was organized after the revolution then why did it fail revisionism because i have a hard time believing that the oppressive soviet state wouldve ever led to full communism aside from the people rising up against it and overthrowing it
socialism,not_removed,ive read half of it though youre right i need to finish it
socialism,not_removed,ive already showed how the interests of the collective capitalist are sometimes opposed to individual capitalists while the state in its current form may sometimes restrict some capitalists as individuals especially when they act against the laws of the state in which the protection of the ruling class is included it acts in the interests of the bourgeoisie by defending their position as the ruling class some people do and i guess if the bourgeois state represses some of the bourgeoisie than i guess they are being repressed by the bourgeoisie itself sort of you are however thinking of the dictatorship of the proletariat as a bourgeois state which somehow serves the interests of the proletariat which would explain why you think that the ussr was socialist any form of organisation that will take the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat will have to be inherently democratic and horizontal for the working class otherwise in my opinion it cant be a dictatorship of the proletariat the proletariat can abolish private property by simply not working refusing the orders of the bosses and producing for themselves they dont need to become a ruling class for this and they dont need a state if the proletariat wishes to change society it must by definition become the ruling class so as to abolish class society
socialism,not_removed,the proletariat can abolish private property by simply not working refusing the orders of the bosses and producing for themselves you sound like youve been reading too much crimethinc next youll be saying we should all hop trains and eat from dumpsters
socialism,not_removed,the proletariat can abolish private property by simply not working refusing the orders of the bosses and producing for themselves lmao yeah im sure the capitalists would just allow workers to take over without a serious armed struggle
socialism,not_removed,outside pressures mostly since the october revolution it became clear that the ussr would face constant threat of incasion from the outside should it let its guard down this resulted in an authoritarian regime where workers were exploited to fund national defense
socialism,not_removed,while the state in its current form may sometimes restrict some capitalists as individuals especially when they act against the laws of the state in which the protection of the ruling class is included it acts in the interests of the bourgeoisie by defending their position as the ruling class youre still just denying the freedom of the individual and you havent addressed my question as to why it is preferable that individual workers are repressed for the good of the collective worker any form of organisation that will take the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat will have to be inherently democratic and horizontal democracy the rule of the people or the collective over the individual is not something i support so no im not thinking anything about the dotp that those who support it dont present it as if the proletariat wishes to change society it must by definition become the ruling class so as to abolish class society i just showed you how they could without becoming the ruling class if all youre going to do is repeat yourself i dont see the point of continuing
socialism,not_removed,i have not been and i wouldnt
socialism,not_removed,what i said did not exclude the necessity of armed struggle what it called into question is the need for a state and the institution of policies to transition away from capitalism
socialism,not_removed,youre still just denying the freedom of the individual and you havent addressed my question as to why it is preferable that individual workers are repressed for the good of the collective worker because you do not explain how the individual worker is repressed for the good of the collective worker whatever the means is the abolition of capitalism which the dotp represents not in the interests of individual workers but only in the interests of the collective worker democracy the rule of the people or the collective over the individual is not something i support so no im not thinking anything about the dotp that those who support it dont present it as id like anarchy too but if you arent going to utilise democratic forms of organisation during the revolution i highly doubt your revolution will last i just showed you how they could without becoming the ruling class if all youre going to do is repeat yourself i dont see the point of continuing by refusing to obey their bosses and producing for themselves so how do they defend the workplaces theyve seized without organised resistance ie a dictatorship of the proletariat is it just everyone for themselves and how does the proletariat doing these things effectively taking control of society not make them the ruling class
socialism,not_removed,is the abolition of capitalism which the dotp represents not in the interests of individual workers but only in the interests of the collective worker im saying states can not respect the rights of individuals and so long as you talk about states or forms of government like democracy you talk about the slavery of the individual by the collective id like anarchy too but if you arent going to utilise democracy during the revolution i highly doubt your revolution will last i think when you start prescribing certain forms to the revolution you lose the spontaneity that made up its revolutionary content did the miners strike in the in the uk because they refused the pleas of the labour party and the stalinists to allow scabs to vote on it so how do they defend the workplaces theyve seized without organised resistance ie a dictatorship of the proletariat with guns is it just everyone for themselves no and how does the proletariat doing these things effectively taking control of society not make them the ruling class expropriating private property does not put the workers in a position of ruling over the propertied the former propertied are not oppressed they are not repressed they are merely expected to get in line or go off and do their own thing
socialism,not_removed,what a beautiful man
socialism,not_removed,well lets hope so
socialism,not_removed,can any one from the uk even explain how the hell brexit would bring about socialism in the uk that seems so silly
socialism,not_removed,cant be a socialist country if youre in a capitalist trade bloc
socialism,not_removed,i think hes arguing that it would be harder for employers to exploit lower wages with britain outside of the eu but the labour party is in its last death throes at the moment
socialism,not_removed,ahh ok got it does labour have a future at all in england
socialism,not_removed,not under the current leadership but the labour party still has a lot of roots politics is always cyclical the conservative party were dead and buried once
socialism,not_removed,apparently its gotten pretty weird but all i have are secondhand stories
socialism,not_removed,knowledge is power comrades its why conservatives reactionaries and fascists are so hostile to education
socialism,not_removed,having fun isnt hard when youve got a library card
socialism,not_removed,dat art just give me a steady job making aesthetic propaganda until death edit lets leave it at retirement
socialism,not_removed,insert bernie bros insinuating libraries are socialism
socialism,not_removed,xpost referenced from rpropagandaposters by uexepony i am a bot i delete my negative comments httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetooriginalpostsearcher httpsgithubcompapernotesredditoriginalpostsearcher httpsgithubcompapernotesredditoriginalpostsearcherfaq
socialism,not_removed,i like it
socialism,not_removed,well im interested in supernatural horror that isnt gogol or poe too bad it was considered part of religious superstition and not published until which is especially ridiculous since many horror writers were atheists
socialism,not_removed,i dont suppose the soviet library would have jazz music would it edit i must have pissed off some social conservatives marxistleninists down with jazz and other forms of bourgeois degeneracy
socialism,not_removed,i agree
socialism,not_removed,this sub is hostile to the socialist revolutions that managed to sustain themselves
socialism,not_removed,i know really nice art style in the poster theres something about early soviet aesthetic which just looks great the yellow and red colour scheme the modern utopian art and posters heck lenin was a pretty cool looking guy unfortunately the same goes for the nazis regardless of their fucking terrible ideology you have to admit that have you considered making propaganda for modern day socialists im sure that rojava wouldnt mind some artwork if youre any good at making it
socialism,not_removed,why are you being downvoted for this lol
socialism,not_removed,no need to use clintonian propaganda of bernie bros to get a point across
socialism,not_removed,i dont think ive seen sanders supporters saying anything like that
socialism,not_removed,they arent
socialism,not_removed,although lovecraft planted extremely reactionary themes in his work
socialism,not_removed,by the they were with it some great soviet jazz funk out there
socialism,not_removed,why did you get downvoted for asking about jazz
socialism,not_removed,whats with this whole stalin banned jazz thing lmao like even if you hate stalin thats just such a ridiculous and baseless claim to make
socialism,not_removed,yeah not gonna lie i dont really want to throw my support in for a government that employed work camps for dissenters mass arbitrary arrest large scale executions and a pretty shit record of censorship no i am not talking about freeze peaches i am talking about the fact that you couldnt criticize the effective one party and under stalin one man government also the fact the ussr stabbed the other socialists and anarchists in the back often sending them to said labor camps or crushed the ukrinian free state the propaganda posters are pretty dope though wont complain about those as is the red army choir and their space program as well as the fact they killed a whole bunch of nazis so there is that but dont think people hate them because they sustained themselves or arent practical people hat them because they sucked from an ethical standpoint
socialism,not_removed,brocialist fuck off
socialism,not_removed,seriously i really hated their fits since day its like duh too bourgeois or whatever even got fashion wrong rojava wouldnt mind some artwork if youre any good at making it i wouldnt want to ruin their thing lol
socialism,not_removed,you tell me comrade kek
socialism,not_removed,he went too far in pandering to liberals on this one
socialism,not_removed,well they often are the loudest people saying muh anything the government does is socialism
socialism,not_removed,not in and of themselves no socialism requires social ownership of the means of production the exact organization of that control being subject to whatever kind of socialist tendency you identify with things like libraries and schools in the united states are merely aspects of liberal programs of social welfare just because something provides free stuff to the public does not mean it is socialist regardless of how much right wingers talk about socialism meaning hand outs and free stuff you seem new here so welcome to the sub
socialism,not_removed,lovecraft would not be published even if the ussr had saner attitude to horror there is no doubt about it i like him but sometimes i wish hed live in the ussr a bit he would probably be more frustrated than the most obnoxious and elitist exaristrocrats and members of the whites and would quickly have nervous breakdown over the herd being everywhere not knowing their place not only he was famously racist his hatred to the working class was palpable
socialism,not_removed,got any links id love to have a listen
socialism,not_removed,the fact that music was heavily controlled in the soviet system is hardly some kind of baseless western myth
socialism,not_removed,who said anything about stalin
socialism,not_removed,im pretty sure its a reference to hoxha calling jazz jungle music
socialism,not_removed,but didnt you know that was all for the greater good of the people besides they were surrounded by enemies and reactionaries and traitors what could they possibly do ya
socialism,not_removed,a government that employed work camps for dissenters mass arbitrary arrest large scale executions and a pretty shit record of censorship fun game time is this about catalonia or the ussr
socialism,not_removed,i see you are continuing your aggressive campaign of trying to liberalize the sub best of luck
socialism,not_removed,formatted in that way because you have literally never read anything about them or
socialism,not_removed,prove my point why dont you if we dont take the ussr and the prc as learning experiences for both positives and negatives we are doing ourselves a disservice dismissing successful revolutions out of hand is a mistake that leaves us only with unfalsifiable notions to dream about ahistorically dismissing people that point out biases is just toxic to discussion and learning
socialism,not_removed,lenin tended to wear the clothes of the common man so i guess thats less bourgeois and more proletarian
socialism,not_removed,oh dear
socialism,not_removed,they seem to work almost exactly as i think any of us would want in a socialist society of course the backend isnt perfect you seem new here so welcome to the sub hilarious
socialism,not_removed,varg id say that is different as it does taint the music you cant remove his disgusting actions from his work
socialism,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomresultssearchquerysovietjazzfunk
socialism,not_removed,they only suppressed everything that wasnt russian classical music s
socialism,not_removed,im not giving a political opinion but i do really like soviet jazz
socialism,not_removed,i mean there were a lot of soviet contemporary not classical in the musical sense really composers my fave is shostakovich but there were many others but that doesnt mean they didnt have jazz or other popular music what point are you trying to make here
socialism,not_removed,i wasnt talking about control of music in general though thats a different discussion i was talking specifically about the claim that jazz music was banned which is pretty much entirely a baseless western myth no matter how you look at it
socialism,not_removed,theres a weird myth that stalin banned jazz in the ussr which youre essentially repeating here as some gotcha to the tankies
socialism,not_removed,there was no reference to hoxha or albania just the ussr so i doubt it
socialism,not_removed,yeah i know and its totally different from what fascists did cause they didnt use literally the exact same excuse they were the communist party what more proof do you need they were building communism
socialism,not_removed,since when does murdering gay people relate to defending from counterrevolution
socialism,not_removed,and is it a coincidence that the soviet union had influence in catalonia and that the worst phase of catalonian authoritarian communism was brought about by the stalinist parties with close relations to the ussr
socialism,not_removed,lol what
socialism,not_removed,but they never even came close to socialism
socialism,not_removed,yeah i was refering to the nazi ones btw they look specially bourgeois no problem with bolshevik fits
socialism,not_removed,he definitely knows what it is watch videos of him from the hes very knowledgeable
socialism,not_removed,i dont think this video alone is enough to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was a socialist at the time he made this speech
socialism,not_removed,implying theres a significant difference between most selfidentifying demsocs and liberals
socialism,not_removed,bill maher is a big propagator of the government ownershipsocialism thing he called florida a socialist place
socialism,not_removed,toothbrushes work the same in socialism and capitalism does that mean they are socialist
socialism,not_removed,why do you keep talking about stalin i never said anything about stalin i criticized the ussr for being a socially conservative state which banned certain music as bourgeois degeneracy whether they banned jazz specifically or not is beside the point saying they didnt ban jazz they banned other music doesnt exactly refute me
socialism,not_removed,the big other has to go
socialism,not_removed,fascists didnt use the same excuse at all though
socialism,not_removed,my point is that catalonia had all those things too lol not whataboutism at all
socialism,not_removed,im actually referring to what the anarchists did not the marxistleninist party or the poum but the cntfai
socialism,not_removed,you keep admonishing people for taking a line against reformism this is not a social democrat sub its an anti capitalist left sub
socialism,not_removed,im a tankie because i said this sub is hostile to the ussr to which you were dismissively hostile to me got it beep beep tank coming through
socialism,not_removed,oh come on im a trot and even i know that mlstalinists arent fascists stop watering down the word by calling fellow comrades fascists they did a whole lot of wrong but they arent fascists
socialism,not_removed,no not the anarcho syndicalist left purist definition where the workers somehow run foreign policy and international large scale trade from a factory floor no that has never been achieved at any scale
socialism,not_removed,i see this thrown at the ussr a lot which i agree it wasnt complete worker control but state socialism but the prc made huge advancements towards socialism with large scale communes democratic worker control of factories etc this danishfrench documentary does a great job of displaying this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxcwafmgvls
socialism,not_removed,oh i see i just think its a really well designed outfit
socialism,not_removed,what bill maher wrong say it isnt so
socialism,not_removed,just because were prorevolutionary doesnt mean we have to discard everything that currently exists and start over from scratch
socialism,not_removed,that was part of an antisemitic campaign but even then this doesnt show any repression besides ideological theres nothing that shows this as being a government suppression either because anticosmopolitanism was part of nationalism in the ussr that was a reaction to us aggression it wasnt banned as another commenter heavily implied it was just frowned upon by society as a whole as for that lenin quote that comes from memoirs of clara zetkin so keep in mind it may be paraphrased slightly however its decontextualized here is what follows we must retain the beautiful take it as an example hold on to it even though it is old why turn away from real beauty and discard it for good and all as a starting point for further development just because it is old why worship the new as the god to be obeyed just because it is the new that is nonsense sheer nonsense there is a great deal of conventional art hypocrisy in it too and respect for the art fashions of the west of course unconscious we are good revolutionaries but we feel obliged to point out that we stand at the height of contemporary culture i have the courage to show myself a barbarian i cannot value the works of expressionism futurism cubism and other isms as the highest expressions of artistic genius i dont understand them they give me no pleasure but lenin continued our opinion on art is not important nor is it important what art gives to a few hundreds or even thousands of a population as great as ours art belongs to the people it must have its deepest roots in the broad mass of workers it must be understood and loved by them it must be rooted in and grow with their feelings thoughts and desires it must arouse and develop the artist in them are we to give cake and sugar to a minority when the mass of workers and peasants still lack black bread i mean that not as you might think only in the literal sense of the word but also figuratively we must keep the workers and peasants always before our eyes we must learn to reckon and to manage for them even in the sphere of art and culture so that art may come to the people and the people to art we must first of all raise the general level of education and culture and how is our country in that respect you are amazed at the tremendous cultural work we have accomplished since the seizure of power without being boastful we can say that we have done much in this respect very much we have not only cut off heads as the mensheviks and their kautskys in all countries accuse us of doing we have also enlightened heads many heads but many only in comparison with the past and the sins of the ruling classes and cliques of those times we are confronted with the gigantic needs of the workers and peasants for education and culture needs awakened and stimulated by us not only in petrograd and moscow in the industrial centers but outside them in the villages and we are a poor nation a mendicant nation whether we like it or not the majority of the old people remain culturally the victims the disinherited of course we are carrying on a vigorous campaign against illiteracy we are setting up libraries and reading huts in the small towns and villages we are organizing educational courses of the most varied nature we arrange good theatrical productions and concerts we send educational tableaux and traveling exhibitions over the country but i repeat what is all that to the many millions who lack the most elementary knowledge the most primitive culture while in moscow today ten thousand – and perhaps tomorrow another ten thousand – are charmed by brilliant theatrical performances millions are crying out to learn the art of spelling of writing their names of counting are crying for culture are anxious to learn for they are beginning to understand that the universe is ruled by natural laws and not by the heavenly father and his witches and wizards
socialism,not_removed,but they didnt ban any type of music thats the point im making they ostracized some of it they looked down upon some of it but they didnt ban any musical styles thats the myth youre repeating whether or not you mention stalin when repeating it is irrelevant
socialism,not_removed,but there are so many o
socialism,not_removed,im sorry i dont follow
socialism,not_removed,whats different about it just a note im not invoking horseshoe theory here there are still considerable differences between the soviet union and fascist governments but they still both said they had to terrible things cause dissidents are traitors trying to destroy the country
socialism,not_removed,i dont know much about that to be honest i was under the impression the anarchists were a bit better
socialism,not_removed,no i was admonishing someone for attacking the reformist this isnt a sub exclusively for us revolutionaries this is a broad tent sub hell even anarchists and communists get along here cant we all just hate capitalism together note i am not a reformist i just dislike it when people take a big old shit on their chest because they the reformist dont want to see a war
socialism,not_removed,some of these comrades wont be long for the left if they cant take mild criticism of their tendency or social groups like adults
socialism,not_removed,executing gay people is not very socialist
socialism,not_removed,the prc committed many acts of imperialism and ethnic cleansing as well as general nastiness
socialism,not_removed,well designed outfit no doubt about that of course
socialism,not_removed,no nobody is saying that nobody is saying libraries cannot exist in a socialist society we or at least im saying that libraries are completely unrelated to socialism in our current system
socialism,not_removed,antisemitic campaign form of nationalism in the ussr ahh yes racism and nationalism the two pillars of marxist thought oh wait that cant be right
socialism,not_removed,comrade is saying its getting fucking old and unproductive to raise the spectre of fascism whenever the failures or perceived failures of the ussr and prc are discussed
socialism,not_removed,thats oversimplifying both scenarios fascists used the argument that imperfections in society jews or noncatholics or nonnationalists or whatever were detrimental to social order and to be cleansed were a plot to destroy the unity of the nation etc this is a long ways away from the ussr saying that fascists were trying to take down their government either internally or externally especially after you consider the historical build up like the anticomintern pact between fascist governments the spanish civil war the assassination of kirov grainhoarding by rich peasants during the famine and numerous instances of industrial sabotage while you can say they spoke of a fifth column that didnt exist its ahistorical to say there wasnt precedent for that fear and when you add on to that the military dissenters and militias that formed in favor of the nazis it seems plausible to say the least
socialism,not_removed,read my other comment on this im not repeating myself more than necessary
socialism,not_removed,ok whatever you say bro lmao
socialism,not_removed,im saying that if the reasons listed above were reasons for the ussr being totalitarian or whatever then catalonia was as well the reason i bring up catalonia is because when antiauthoritarians are bringing up alternatives to the ussr thats often the first that pops up
socialism,not_removed,actually had a bit of antichurch violence that effected some innocent people nuns and clergy that werent involved which sucked even though the catholic church in spain at the time could collectively go suck a huge one for helping the fascists and shitting on the poor for so long
socialism,not_removed,well an anarchist just slandered me for saying people are hostile to anything ussr here so maybe we can all do a little better being solidary
socialism,not_removed,which is a shame because being shat on for your beliefs are a staple of the comrades diet
socialism,not_removed,do i see the rationale yes i do i even think trotsky would have done a lot of the things stalin did the ussr was in a shit situation and the only way the violence and censorship could have been prevented was if the ussr tried to export the revolution which would have ended catastrophically very likely or not which was a gamble the bureaucracy was not willing to make
socialism,not_removed,your katana has no trouble with that straw man nobody is arguing for stalinism here nobody
socialism,not_removed,whered you here this was this during the days of mao
socialism,not_removed,i think its totally reasonable to say that libraries look act and feel almost exactly like we should expect most public institutions to work in a socialist society
socialism,not_removed,i never said the soviet union was perfect marxist paradise im not some utopian lol there were actually good criticisms of antisemitism and analyses of nationalism to come out of the ussr its not like everyone had the same opinion and was some drone of the party or some shit
socialism,not_removed,i agree with you to an extent the ussr was certainly under attack by reactionary forces but the issue i have is that this was used as an excuse to suppress any dissent reactionary or not put down labor movements and centralize power much the same way fascists used fear to crush any opposition they had different end goals but they largely used the same means
socialism,not_removed,i know about that and i find it hard to fault them for attacking the church considering how reactionary and oppressive catholicism was in spain sure some innocents were killed but in a violent revolution thats inevitable
socialism,not_removed,and you just slandered me by saying i am trying to infest the sub with liberalism oh the irony
socialism,not_removed,at least im getting used to being called a brocialist whatever that means seems to change day to day
socialism,not_removed,i even think trotsky would have done a lot of the things stalin did he did do a lot of the things stalin did
socialism,not_removed,youre arguing that we should be learning lessons from stalinism so you kind of are
socialism,not_removed,yes invasion of tibet springs to mind
socialism,not_removed,absolutely but understand what im saying when liberals etc use the argument libraries in a capitalist society are socialism thats wrong
socialism,not_removed,im gonna be honest here this really just reads like horseshoe theory with an anarchist twist like you can argue all those things about the ussr thats fine but i still think its incredibly ahistorical to say they used the same methods unless of course you abstract it to the point where theres hardly room for distinguishing between any methods of state power being exercised is probably the book that does the best job at showing the difference and to be clear im not saying you have to be some tankie or leninist or whatever we have that type of argument often enough on this shitty ass website and this thread is probably the worst place for it lol
socialism,not_removed,no they really didnt lol you cant just replace words and act like youve made a good argument
socialism,not_removed,typically brocialists are all about no war but the class war and are not interested in intersectional oppression of women poc lgbt people or other minorities in a society
socialism,not_removed,the ussr is not synonymous with stalinism if everything is only defined by its worst parts what good is fucking anything how do you learn or progress christ this is close minded
socialism,not_removed,i thought you were done replying to my comments with ahistoric arguments guess not
socialism,not_removed,you cant just whitewash history says the person who is basically just regurgitating reaganitelevel horseshoe theory gotta love this subreddit full of gold like this
socialism,not_removed,im not saying that the soviet union was a fascist regime per se im just saying that it had a lot of similarities horseshoe theory doesnt argue that communist countries were fascist just that there isnt a significant or significant enough difference between communism and fascism so yeah this is horseshoe theory and if you want to defend that but replace communist with stalinist or something thats fine whatever but i already linked a far more in depth response to that argument and i dont think theres much more to add to the discussion here that just wont end up being circular and boring and aggravating if you want to actually keep up a discussion about this and not just respond sarcastically you can message me
socialism,not_removed,all political activity must be joyous and exciting in itself you cannot escape from dreariness with more dreariness to accomplish those first two steps entirely new political approaches and methods must be created the old ones are outdated outmoded perhaps they were never any good and thats why our world is the way it is now what come on politics is not fun and it cant be fun richard seymour had a piece about how a left that comes out for political street parties will languish and a left that insists all politics has to be fun is bizarre when have we ever believed this
socialism,not_removed,hmm i guess no one is in the mood for postleft anarchism
socialism,not_removed,you misunderstand what the point of this article is about sure we cant just go throw parties and hope the bourgeois will just give up power but we cannot use our old tactics because they are proven to be unsuccessful we must relate to the working class in a way that suits them not necessarily in the ways that we think would be best for the working class like bordiga said the ruling class loves it when we go on strike or protest because they know that the gratifications they give us are just token in nature and they can roll back these appeasements at a later date when opinions change while you took joyous and exciting to mean fun street parties what the article writer is trying to convey is that these political approaches we take in order to gain classconsciousness and to organize the proletariat for an eventual revolution must be something the proletariat enjoys and something that they can relate to like pablo iglesias said we cannot go out and spew marx or engels or lenin randomly to workers in hopes that they will suddenly gain classconsciousness and organize instead we must inspire these workers with methods that appeal and relate to them ie by using social media reddit having luncheons in working class parts of town etc we as a collective left in order to further our cause has to admit that our movement has become somewhat elitist and intellectual and the working class has always held reservations about movements that come off as that thats why fascism is on the rise because members of the working class can relate more to someone of their own race and nationality rather than someone like slavoj zizek i hope that rather dismissing the complete article as rubbish because you misunderstood some of the language you actually take into consideration the overall argument the author is trying to make even though it was written for postleft anarchy any and all leftist movements can take something from this have a nice day comrade
socialism,not_removed,alright it just seemed like old ways have failed seemed a bit presumptuous and the suggestion that we cant fight monotony with monotony was unfair the current order is full of death destruction and suffering not just monotony intellectualism and elitism is fair but i dont think there are any easy answers but im not an anarchist so i dont know how you guys see the role of the party and the masses i look forward to seeing the new methods you guys find so we can potentially emulate or at least learn from them
socialism,not_removed,thank you comrade and thank you for not being sectarian im not really an anarchist myself im a bordigist with a lot of individualist stirnerite leanings but i do think that regardless of political philosophy the group that best appeals to the working class will always get the working class support and this article is mainly to critique passed marxist and anarchist tactics to gain the support of the working class
socialism,not_removed,we are all socialist memes
socialism,not_removed,when i first went to rthedonald i thought it was a joke like the poes law but reverse
socialism,not_removed,memes of the world unite
socialism,not_removed,so anybody who knows what the hell is going on care to give a socialist perspective dont really want to go in to the defaults also
socialism,not_removed,this event shows us beside the western view even the some of socialists dont have clear marxist perspective of democracy what we belive is parlamentary democracy or parlamentary majority can rule i dont think so ok maduros venezuela of course not best socialist system actualy we know well that its not a socialist state too but sometimes we must decide who is good and who is bad venezuela chavista is a state who trying to survive with their socialist view almost alone in the continent in ceuntry so if a socialist have to choise i think we must choise between neoliberal conservatives like accion democratica and chavistas the choise is clear we should stand by with venezuela who have lots of enemy specialy in this times saludos desde turquia
socialism,not_removed,in a nutshell members of the national assembly was found to have committed fraud during the parlimentary election and the supreme court had them stripped of their position until new elections could be held the na swore them in regardless and the na was held in contempt all their actions deemed illegal until they comply with the ruling so the imperialist media is using this as a means of building up a case for action against venezuela eg more sanctions military intervention etc as socialists we should stand with venezuela and denounce these attempts to demonize the venezuelan people and destroy the bolivarian revolution
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,so the national assembly has been in contempt of the law because members of parliament have been found to have blatantly committed voter fraud and there are probably even more this appears to be a temporary measure until the parliament abides by the law the opposition has illegally sworn them in and seated them regardless at the same time this national assembly is obstructing everything even the most basic attempts to address the crisis this is because the opposition wants the crisis to go on because they are aligned with those who cause the crisis it is primarily the venezuelan billionairemillionaire class that is aligned with the opposition causing the crisis they have been using their big importing businesses to divert goods bought with preferential dollars to the black market they have been using their food production companies to cut production or divert production to the black market then smaller businesses are also doing this in response creating shortages of subsidized goods while they have been doing this essentially since the beginning of price controls after the failed usback coup of chavez it has only been effective over the last two years since the collapse of the oil market the bolivarian government was importing much more goods when it was making money off of oil now this is not possible and the sabotage of the billionaire class is taking its toll the government has put million people onto the clap program meaning that the poor who rely on subsidized goods are now getting these goods delivered to their homes through community committees this is fighting the hoarding of the average consumer who would buy more than needed of a certain good in stores because the big businesses have created artificial scarcity this wont solve the issue there are two roads collapse of the revolution where goods would return to market price and the poor would not be able to afford them anyway as was the case prior to the revolution or the other option is the radicalization of the revolution with widespread nationalization there is not a public monopoly on production on trade or production in venezuela despite over years of revolution public monopoly of trade and production is crucial for the success of socialist construction because it takes away the power of the bourgeoisie to create economic sabotage as they are doing now maduro and the mainstream psuv want to hold power but they seem to be hesitant to do anything to the national bourgeoisie and instead are intent on trying to negotiate with them this wont work they will continue economic sabotage to defend their interests against the poor and working people of venezuela
socialism,not_removed,yes whats going on does anyone have any good sources on the country for the past few years was chavez a socialist im afraid i dont know too much about the country
socialism,not_removed,probably better at stating this than i am sorry for stalking but this is a pretty good explanation that i will post on the megathread
socialism,not_removed,sure but that is just the ins and outs of the these events broader context a populist came into power on the backs of a mass movement of workers and poor he stumbled his way through government attempting to democratize society and build social programs after a coup attempt and a couple other attempts to bring him down he realized that capitalism cannot be reformed and came out in favour of socialism he tried to build organs of popular power some of which worked others different he learned the lessons of allendes defeat and started finding ways to arm the masses he launched a mass socialist party which numbers in the millions he imposed a whole bunch of price controls and tried to manipulate the market to help the people but he did not nationalize the economy he did not actually build socialism then he got cancer and died and then the oil market crashed everything went to shit and the opposition representing the actual ruling class managed to win a narrow election victory after a decade and a half of bolivarian landslides but maduro chavezs handpicked successor is still in office because the presidential elections dont happen at the same time as the national assembly elections now we have a dual power situation with the country split down the middle weve reached the limits of bourgeois democracy good thing chavez armed the masses shits about to get real
socialism,not_removed,i am very far from being a venezuelan constitutional lawyer but that does seem like an overpowered remedy to three fraudulent local elections what this amounts to is the executive branch saying that they dont like how people voted last time and so arent going to let their representatives try to do their jobs theyre right to not like it but elections should have consequences or they may as well not be had at all
socialism,not_removed,reminder that telesur is paid by the government so it will be on their side
socialism,not_removed,is there anything in english
socialism,not_removed,yes theres a good documentary about chavez free on youtube its hard to watch really graphic scenes but evreyone should search for the revolution should not be televised
socialism,not_removed,no he did not socialize much production at all especially if we mean socialism as worker management of production and a change in managerial relations
socialism,not_removed,so your siding with the reactionary opposition they dont care about any election or amazonia for that matter this is all a farce to paint venezuela as a dictatorship the same thing happened in chile with allende even though he was elected and they would love to see the same thing happen to maduro
socialism,not_removed,the truth must not be only the truthit must also be told fidel castro
socialism,not_removed,what this amounts to is the executive branch saying that they dont like how people voted last time and so arent going to let their representatives try to do their jobs id read the article first before making such a statement
socialism,not_removed,yes
socialism,not_removed,man dude im honestly assuming you arent from around to say those things and no its not siding with anyone but what the government did is really highly illegal and unbalances the different powers im on the side of my country thats it
socialism,not_removed,if you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor desmond tutu
socialism,not_removed,i listened to this earlier today david wong sort of twisted his own logic to fit his liberal view he used anecdotes when it was convenient while criticizing the use of anecdotes he criticized pessimism to back up his point and criticized optimism to back up his point he said you cant only think about the us you have to think globally when it made neoliberalism sound good and said in the us everything is awesome when it made neoliberalism sound good it was a contradictory mixture of you cant just sit and do nothing and be complacent dont worry the greedy billionaires will fix everything that was all just to promote the status quo the myth that capitalist greed is the cause of everything good and all technological advances needs to die asap
socialism,not_removed,not sure what a marxist training camp is though pretty disappointed ive never been invited to one
socialism,not_removed,wasnt this already apparent
socialism,not_removed,secret marxists are no good to the workingclass movement mind even modest proworker reforms in neoliberal society require the backing of mass social resistance and you cant build that with reformsfromabove as much as i respect mcdonnell and his tireless fighting the corner of various workingclass causes expecting him to suddenly create a marxist utopia out of a hat is a hiding to nothing
socialism,not_removed,seriously where do i sign up
socialism,not_removed,union of soviet socialist republics were another failed marxist regime i love how they emboldened socialist its like see dude its in the name that must be what they stand for
socialism,not_removed,yeah i thought he was an open marxist
socialism,not_removed,gotta keep dem juicy moderates on your side
socialism,not_removed,marxist training camp is tory speak for a community meeting of leftleaning citizens
socialism,not_removed,he denied being a marxist on question time last month
socialism,not_removed,thats so weird why would you praise lenin and trotsky and then deny being a marxist which is way less controversial
socialism,not_removed,thank god it seems like every other sub that purports itself to be left of center is filled with delusional hillbots
socialism,not_removed,you got a binary choice choose or dont
socialism,not_removed,well as there are more than two candidates the choice youre referring to must be voting for the right or the left ill choose stein in that case
socialism,not_removed,this comment really adds something to the discussion
socialism,not_removed,there are only two viable candidates thats the reality if you choose stein which is your right and your state is undetermined you may be getting someone who will hurt you into office
socialism,not_removed,think longer than four years voting for hillary will push the dems further to the right further antiworker antiplanetand antiprogress
socialism,not_removed,your imagination is running over hillary will go where the dems in congress go
socialism,not_removed,precisely the dems in congress will only stagnate or slowly slide into having more and more extreme neoliberal views
socialism,not_removed,dear piece of shit corporate shill and spineless liberal fuck off shut up and never post here again you will not earn your paycheck on this sub
socialism,not_removed,signed sealed and delivered knock them out
socialism,not_removed,if that isnt the modern democratic way i dont know what is celebrate the democratic process only to absolutely debase it when it goes contrary to your desired outcomes fucking tired of it when the people speak listen to them
socialism,not_removed,thank you so much comrades if you live in australia i suggest you also post the link on your facebook will help immensely we are going to hit the ground running on monday with a public campaign on the campus to pressure them to rescind the ban but the big social media response that we have had will do wonders here is a more thorough summary of what went on from one of my comrades who has been banned i have been the target of systematic vilification by liberal students and the current arts union committee at uwa i can barely believe how low a bunch of student politicians will sink when they feel that their safeguarded positions in campus institutions are threatened by ordinary students i received of the vote for president of the arts union but the person who only received has been declared the victor the arts union for those of you who dont know is an important institution at uwa it claims to represent all arts students but like most official bodies on the campus it is dominated by a privileged little clique of student politicians and private school head boys and girls it operates as an exclusive personal party planning committee for those who control it usually elected by a handful of their friends each year science union for example had little over votes cast in its recent election the arts unions record on campus issues is even worse last years president openly supported the cuts to gender studies and other majors this year the union has done nothing to fight against the cuts to staff which have hit the arts worse than most faculties but a group of activists myself included have been campaigning for the past two years against what we see as the constant erosion of education quality at uwa we thought that arts students had a right to expect their union to support them not suck up to the people cutting their courses and so we decided to put an argument to students that it was time for a different kind of arts union such a move is apparently unacceptable to uwas cabal of student aristocrats they responded to this challenge not with rational argument but with undemocratic and bullying behaviour heres a nonexhaustive list of some of their attempts to keep activists out of the arts union this year they banned all campaigning in an attempt to disenfranchise hundreds of students who would never even find out about the elections all talk of the elections in the arts building or libraries was banned only one facebook post and unlimited texting was allowed clearly turning the elections into a popularity contest the arts union executive unconstitutionally appointed two ros one of whom is a liberal student who ran against myself and other candidates in the most recent guild election liberal students and members of the au executive stalked and harassed me around campus over the past week a particularly nasty liberal spent a few minutes filming my arse without my knowledge and shared it with his friends which would generally constitute sexual harassment the ros then tried to use this footage as evidence in their attempt to ban me i and three other candidates were sent identical emails with no details or evidence informing us that we would be struck from the ballot in a vengeful rage about losing their arts union the liberal students and indiestar people on guild council have begun the process of trying to disaffiliate the socialist alternative club of which i am the campus president not satisfied with all this they may go one step further rumours have already reached me that an army of people are going to try and expel me from my degree at uwa i presume this army consists of rich dummyspitting liberals who cant handle losing threats of expulsion abounded in last nights guild council meeting as the au results were counted and the aristocrats descended into a collective tantrum these complaints and threats emanated from indies and liberals alike if youve read this far thank you but id like to ask a favour of everyone please dont let these privileged brats win despite the outrageous behaviour listed above an overwhelming number of students just voted for a democratic inclusive union which will represent all of us i think this proves that the people whove crowned themselves royalty at uwa are actually an unpopular minority out of touch with normal students like any monarchy they can be overthrown
socialism,not_removed,fucking young liberals are the worst slimy little daddys boys the lot of em
socialism,not_removed,aussies should sign it primarily petitions lose their reliability when theyre signed by people outside of country its set in
socialism,not_removed,what uni is the uwa what country is it in
socialism,not_removed,gotchu comrade give em the hell they deserve
socialism,not_removed,me and josh over at black banter party podcast will mention your petition we both signed it cant promise well get the episode up in time but well try
socialism,not_removed,signed
socialism,not_removed,theres no need to be so vitriolic many liberals potentially even some of those that op mentioned have been misled by the system i dont know too much about the political atmosphere in australia but from my experience there is a pretty strong boogeyman figure associated with anything that is even remotely related to marxs ideas or pretty much anything that can be thought of as related to communism by any stretch of the imagination in some cases not necessarily ops case it can be a good idea to try and reason with them
socialism,not_removed,i reckon its fine if nonaustralians sign it will scare the shit out of them that people overseas have even heard about it
socialism,not_removed,i assume university of western australia
socialism,not_removed,awesome thanks comrade
socialism,not_removed,the liberal party in australia are the governing party of the bourgeoisie and the right the only parties to their right in australia are farright lunatics like pauline hanson back in the day they were borderline fascist look up menziess love for the third reich and now they supervise over an immigration system which is the envy of neonazis the world over they arent liberals in the way you would talk about them in the united states or europe those people we call small l liberals in australia the youth wing of their party the young liberals are particularly notorious for being absolute scum they represent the most homophobic sexist racist and wealthy elements of the student population at australian universities and are generally despised by most ordinary people at my university in specific it is public knowledge that a bunch of leading young liberals are mens rights activists and have been protagonists in rape scandals its safe to say they cant be reasoned with only crushed and driven to the margins of political life hopefully this clears up the misunderstanding
socialism,not_removed,on that note why not mention some of them by name thatll give you leverage id imagine since they wouldnt want election rigging to follow them around into the future if theyre looking to be politicians
socialism,not_removed,ah ok
socialism,not_removed,that was very informative still cant hurt to try to reason with them
socialism,not_removed,i went through a phase about a year back where i spent a lot of time reading about the cult so ill give some of my thoughts scientology is basically an elaborate tax scam they reobtained church status by filing thousands of lawsuits against the government and probably blackmailing and threatening people too they use their taxfree status to buy up large expensive properties all around the world they have lots of front operations like a book publishing business that they use to make profit if you look up david miscaviges speeches on youtube you can see that the cult employs a lot of creepy fascistic imagery too not surprising considering the capitalist strictly toptobottom structure of the cult the cult has mostly survived from donations esp now that their numbers are dwindling from rich capitalist and celebrity members around the world but they also take advantage of a lot of less welloff people too they are very good at manipulating people who are weak or at a low point in their lives for profit they use nearslave labor in many of their orgs im convinced they violate human rights on a regular basis and somehow they continue to get away with it theyre the disturbing visage of the intersection of capitalist exploitation and new agey pseudoreligion i dont understand why the government hasnt cracked down on them hard unless theyre more closely tied than it appears
socialism,not_removed,its a bourgeois cult
socialism,not_removed,the cult has mostly survived from donations esp now that their numbers are dwindling from rich capitalist and celebrity members around the world speaking of celebrities why is it that there are so many celebrities in the church of scientology
socialism,not_removed,yeah ive noticed some of these same parallels too although just based off of skimming articles and threads any good books or longform articles you remember id love to take some time one day to dive into researching scientology and its political economy it does seem like it might be much more integrated with the state than people might assume its utterly baffling why they havent gotten shut down yet but then again the catholic church has been covering up rampant pedophilia for decades so who knows
socialism,not_removed,scientology specifically targets actors they have lots of acting courses around hollywood that are basically schemes to rope actors into the cult with promises of acting work im sure theres probably stuff in dianetics that appeals to the egos of richfamous people too
socialism,not_removed,going clear a piece of blue sky and barefaced messiah are usually the three books everyone recommends mark bunkers httpswwwyoutubecomuserxenutv is an invaluable resource as well tons of really good interviews and footage there
socialism,not_removed,the eighthour work day is not as effective as one would think linus feldt the companys ceo told fast company to stay focused on a specific work task for eight hours is a huge challenge in order to cope we mix in things and pauses to make the work day more endurable at the same time we are having it hard to manage our private life outside of work thatmakes a great deal of sense actually but if anything american companies seem to be moving in the opposite direction with work intruding more and more into your personal life and on job perks intended to keep you in the office longer
socialism,not_removed,a bit sensationalized its only being introduced in a select few places hardly a national thing yet i hope it does become national tho
socialism,not_removed,interesting how the only way we can get leisure is by being more productive i wonder if these companies actually would give them hour work days if it wasnt more productive
socialism,not_removed,to increase productivity and make people happier fuck i wish my government cared about my happiness and actively attempted to increase it
socialism,not_removed,i wasnt aware
socialism,not_removed,swede here we generally dont have a hour work day its unheard of here
socialism,not_removed,see swedish socialism is best socialism s
socialism,not_removed,edit for whoevers asking in and around the era of neoliberalism started with the nixon shock signaling the end of the bretton woods system
socialism,not_removed,this is a urban legend circling the internet for years even some swedes belive it yes the discussion has been up and yes there are political parties who is pushing the argument but it is no official general rule that has gone trough and no it is not the talk of the day over here ps im a swede living in the very kingdom i speak of
socialism,not_removed,this is only implemented by certain companies its not a nationwide law
socialism,not_removed,a shorter work hrs combined with a shorter work days and basic income and socialized profits and strong unions could solve a lot of the problems
socialism,not_removed,people in this sub seem to frown on social democracy corbyn sanders etc yet the victories of social democracy keep getting upvoted and commended like this post can someone explain this apparent contradiction genuine question not trying to troll
socialism,not_removed,sweden does not have a hour work day
socialism,not_removed,so what kind of military does sweden have what do they have for a defense against any possible attacker what did they have when the soviet union was in full power
socialism,not_removed,as a swede wat
socialism,not_removed,shouldnt people be allowed to work whatever hours they want
socialism,not_removed,unrelated but i have a of the streetscape in the thumbnail
socialism,not_removed,and here i am feeling guilty that i only worked hours this week
socialism,not_removed,cool i wonder when we swedes in sweden will be warned about this politicians have been talking about this for years and nothing happens because it is only like small parties that wants this at the moment
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately the nazi party and the right wing alliance coalition are trying to gut this program
socialism,not_removed,so how sweden is going to pay for all of those refugees when producing even roughtly less of goods i cannot see how that will work
socialism,not_removed,fastest growing company in silicon valley uses the method
socialism,not_removed,i work hour days five days a week and i love it i used to work hours per week doing it if i went in at i would be ready to die by now i work hours a week doing data analysis making the same money i dont mind going to work i leave by instead of wanting to die and continuing to work if i worked more than i do now i probably wouldnt get any more done im shot by the time i leave work
socialism,not_removed,ha i only do hours of actual work in the office as is
socialism,not_removed,another reason to love sweden
socialism,not_removed,funny most people believe that americans work insanely hard when in reality most are employed for eight hour but barely work four
socialism,not_removed,there is mounting evidence that for intellectual work a shorter work day actually boosts productivity this is of no interest to anyone in my industry
socialism,not_removed,i work in the filmtv industry i know that everyday when i leave my house that i wont be back for hours at the least ive worked multiple days that were over hours and my longest is i have been doing this years i would not know what to do with myself if i only worked hours haha
socialism,not_removed,i dont think anyone read the article a select few workplaces in sweden are giving a workday a trial run im a laborer in sweden and i know that my employer would rather grind me into dog food than lessen my stresswork load
socialism,not_removed,it was an experiment by the left party to see the effects of a shorter workday but despite positive results the moderate party liberal conservatives are cancelling the experiment
socialism,not_removed,i also wonder about the lunch break whether they are moving from to to a true six hour to or if its just a to to a to that extra hour makes a big difference to the worker
socialism,not_removed,they dont care about their happiness this is just capitalisms way of overcoming the crisis of developing technology and thus less required labour
socialism,not_removed,isnt that the point of the article that they are introducing it mind you i didnt read anywhere that it was going to start just the year old story up the toyota company thats done this already
socialism,not_removed,even if its not socialist using socialist ideas is a good thing no
socialism,not_removed,we made them more productive every capitalist today
socialism,not_removed,could you source the data not cause i dont believe you but because i want to show people
socialism,not_removed,sorry i might be exposing my us history ignorance here wtf happened in
socialism,not_removed,a lot of the national bourgeoisies problems sure
socialism,not_removed,came here from all and i have a question not trying to be an ass this is an honest attempt to understand this we are so far in debt as a country its not funny how could we afford a basic income for everyone as a country when we cant afford to spend money on things like infrastructure upkeep
socialism,not_removed,its just the nature of reddit the people who vote and the people who comment are usually not the same people for instance i comment all the time but i rarely ever upvote or downvote
socialism,not_removed,im confused i keep seeing people flipflop between saying corbyn is a demsoc and a socdem
socialism,not_removed,i can confirm this anecdotally hour work days mean getting paid to browse reddit for at least a quarter of the time i cant stare at excel or google scholar for a full hours
socialism,not_removed,hours actually sounds about right for how much time i actually spend in the lab working on stuff much longer and i get boreddepressed and my productivity goes way down also its not super safe to get bored when working with radioactive material so i typically peace out when it happens
socialism,not_removed,you would probably have time for a hobby or maybe a second to relax perhaps its amazing not dedicating all of your time to work moderation is important in all things
socialism,not_removed,why do you even bother with a house
socialism,not_removed,im the only developer at my work i worked at the office went home and coded from in bed went back to work and didnt leave till my boss told me to go home at thats super rare though and was hugely appreciated
socialism,not_removed,days longer than hours wat
socialism,not_removed,whelp guess well have to make it four hours then then we could also halve the pay and double the workforce how many are unemployed now again
socialism,not_removed,im heading for a shift right now in sweden
socialism,not_removed,probably true but i would be happier with hours less work even if it isnt meant for that reason
socialism,not_removed,hey if it makes people better off in the short term im down maybe with that extra time people can find the time to read some marx
socialism,not_removed,id see if these positions are salaried before saying that there are some good companies out there that actually read federal labor studies and use them to have a happier and better workforce
socialism,not_removed,the first thing i thought about was wages everyone was so concerned with how awesome it sounded and your reply is the first comment challenging the reasoning im concerned with how it would effect the economy
socialism,not_removed,my mother is working hours and my father is pretty close to that teachers have hour weeks etc etc this wont change sweden is in many areas severely understaffed they literally cannot introduce days only a few private ventures do it
socialism,not_removed,theres only like a few local workplaces that are trying it out so its not a big thing yet really
socialism,not_removed,exactly this shit has been circulating forever but ive never met a person on it
socialism,not_removed,weve had some trial projects here in norway though where a few nursing homes and the like have introduced hour days and had tremendous results theres less sick leave workers are happier more employees get full employment rather than part time and the increase in productivity from these factors make it all round more economical some labour organisations campaign with these as examples and the hour day is normally the head parole on every single may day march i wouldnt say were close to implementing it as the standard but progress is made at least
socialism,not_removed,wage labour isnt a socialist idea
socialism,not_removed,it means that in the production compared to doubled by it was higer than in basically is the starting point thats all
socialism,not_removed,are you of the belief that the advancement of the assembly and technology line didnt make them more productive
socialism,not_removed,when you go to inequalityorg and httpinequalityorgincomeinequality their source is source httpwwwepiorgpublicationchartingwagestagnation analysis of bureau of labor statistics and bureau of economic analysis data january following that link shows a less pretty but more professional looking graph that has the same source but has additional information updated from figure a in httpwwwepiorgpublicationraisingamericaspay following that link shows another graph but mentions a source paper and tables in the paper source authors analysis of data from bls labor productivity and costs program bureau of labor statistics current employment statistics public data series and employer costs for employee compensation and bureau of economic analysis national income and product accounts tables and updated from figure in the state of working america edition an economic policy institute book published by cornell university press in however that source doesnt have a link and im doing this on my phone so i dont feel like searching anymore since this takes a while though you now have the source papers names and which tables were used in one paper so you can probably do this from here tell me what you find
socialism,not_removed,would you say this doesnt help workers at all
socialism,not_removed,of course
socialism,not_removed,the premise of your question is flawed there are enough resources to do all of this but those resources are mostly controlled by a tiny minority at the top this is purely a political problem and not an economic one
socialism,not_removed,im no expert but my best answer is that money isnt what you think it is money is printed freely as needed and by demanding with force a taxation paid in us dollars the government forces us dollars to be valuable giving dollars to large banks to give back out as loans and demanding again with force that all debtors repay these loans also makes dollars valuable so you see our federal money is just a means of control and its foundation is the governments ability to exercise force with police courts prisons etc now you can see why the government could easily direct money to go wherever it wants it controls the largescale resource allocation of society for example we have a lot of labor thats wasted on needless bureaucracy rentseeking behaviors like speculation etc and useless bullshit jobs the government could restrict these activities if it wanted to with regulations and then fund infrastructure by simply paying workers to do the jobs it doesnt do this because the alternative what we currently have is hugely profitable to private interests who have been influencing legislation for many decades
socialism,not_removed,first of all welcome thank you for asking a question it seems it has already been answered but to add to it if we reduce the parts of our defense budget the wasteful parts that only serve in making rich capitalists richer causing death and destruction in other countries and those that actually decrease our national security by breeding contempt for our country no one hates us because were free and prosperous and close current tax loopholes while also cutting out multimillion and billion dollar rebates for corporations that abuse these loopholes we would have quite a bit more money to invest back into infrastructure healthcare and a basic income
socialism,not_removed,corbyn is a demsoc labour is socdem
socialism,not_removed,hes antieu so he is at the very least not a social democrat there was also that time he quoted enver hoxha in a speech
socialism,not_removed,every proponent of social democracy like corbyn or sanders gets us a little closer to the ideal society did we also get closer to socialism when the swedish social democratic party enacted eugenics in sweden did my relatives just take one for the team when they were forced sterilized
socialism,not_removed,ive gotten into a spirited debate on here with someone arguing that steps towards socialism are not a good thing or are not important tellign me this isnt about steps some want a socialist shift completely on their own terms and anything that is not promoting workers owning the means of production is not helpful and in fact could be harmful thats part of the general disdain for bernie youre absolutely correct its very immature
socialism,not_removed,do you do research for the cia
socialism,not_removed,also its not super safe to get bored when working with radioactive material didnt think that was something possible
socialism,not_removed,i do have many small quick hobbies ill never get to those birch strip canoe plans tho
socialism,not_removed,i ask myself the same question this year i may be moving to atlanta where they have years of work coming no matter what ive debated doing some vandwellingrvandwelling shoutout and trying to stay on the lot as long as possible shower at the y my main unwind after work is gaming so that can be accomplished in a van relationships are tough to start in our business but when your significant other figures out your passion love for your job they become more understanding you facetime at lunch or have them stop by if allowed whenever possible i wouldnt change it for the world i love what i do i make a product that no one needs and thats the crazy part about how ive made my living a big thank you to all that dont pirate media its allowed me to live a dream life
socialism,not_removed,nice im actually have an it related aa as a step towards a programming ba that im going to finish if we have a slump in work im just starting to mess with now i made a raspberry pi apache server in a paint can i serve files related to the paint shop that i work in locations info paint kit infoaging things uses certain items wall covering use others etc paint swatch library locations using google maps smds info etc its been exciting to have an idea and work it through ultimately id like to add rfid to the mix to track ladders compressors etc this is what ive been doing nights after work lately ha
socialism,not_removed,one continuous shift lasting hours
socialism,not_removed,i know right you should see the look i give my friends when they whine about going to work for hours ive worked one hour day in the last or years and that is on the httpsenwikipediaorgwikimindhuntertvseries that i am currently on hour workday downvote train toot toot
socialism,not_removed,iww has always advocated a hour work day i believe
socialism,not_removed,who wouldnt want to work less work is hell
socialism,not_removed,they do this because the motivation behind it is usually to maximise productivity and thus their profits which is the primary motivation behind all capitalist industry
socialism,not_removed,what are you on about thats completely irrelevant and im not american this is absolutely capitalism and its need to adapt to survive its internal contradictions
socialism,not_removed,but reddit loves to post this every other week and believe the whole country is doing it
socialism,not_removed,which is not enforced btw
socialism,not_removed,well unfortunately were living in that world at the moment any reduction of wage labour is an improvement that comes from a leftist point of view would that be a better way to think of it
socialism,not_removed,not doing more than what your abilities are is a socialist idea we are usually not able to work hours and have time for things that are important to us
socialism,not_removed,worker ownership needs a ton of regulations why
socialism,not_removed,of course it did it likely was thought up by workers and definitely implemented by workers the capitalist steals the increased productivity
socialism,not_removed,sure swedish workers will have increased leisure time though only ensured through the extreme exploitation of the proletariat of developing nations which is a benefit to them it draws out the horrid existence of capitalism though as it overcomes yet another of its crisis with the haunting knowledge that another crisis is only a few years down the line
socialism,not_removed,the question is not flawed and it is a question asked by many people regarding basic income how can we afford it when we can can barely afford the social programs we have now
socialism,not_removed,that could cut out billions but it still wouldnt come close to covering basic income for everyone there are adults in the us the poverty line for a household of is that is trillion a year which is of the total yearly budget in contrast the defense budget for is at billion or of the national budget yes there is a lot of over spending especially to suppliers but in reality you can only cut about from that budget and still maintain a ready defense force all those cuts would have to be at the supplier level take the money away from the personnel and we wont have a force big enough to protect the country if needed not to mention half of the defense departments budget goes directly to the benefits and salaries of those in uniform even though our army hasnt been this small since before you cut much more out and we are at risk in fact the us currently spends more of its budget on health care than defense httpsenwikipediaorgwikiunitedstatesfederalbudgetmediafileusfederalspendingpng all that said nothing you mentioned will help us over come a program that would literally cost of our yearly budget which is in no way feasible no one hates us because were free and prosperous doesnt matter why they hate us i will agree the us fucked up in the past with the middle east but they are not going to get over their hatred because we have a basic income and take money from the dod they already hate us they will continue to hate us so we need a ready force to protect ourselves when needed
socialism,not_removed,i think his flair is a statement about the cpusa like mine is about corbyn
socialism,not_removed,welcome soonmaybe to atlanta the traffic isnt as bad here as they all say i think it stems from people being outwardly friendly and an easy way to strike up conversations with strangers is to bring up traffic to complain about pm me if you want to know about the local areas or whatever
socialism,not_removed,firefighter i guess
socialism,not_removed,workaholics who live for their work or use it a an excuse to not face their actual life
socialism,not_removed,sure id like some free universal income and less time to work for more money but that has nothing to do with socialism and in fact its a method of prolonging capitalisms existence not to mention it comes of the backs of those in the developing world who are being exploited at obscene levels that allows developed countries to have these systems in place
socialism,not_removed,or it could just be a form of bread and circuses for instance otto von bismarck was the one who created the first modern welfare state to quell working class support for socialism
socialism,not_removed,someone tells you this isnt about steps
socialism,not_removed,the bourgeoisie saw an opportunity to increase productivity by implementing technology into their assembly line so they contract out to an engineering firm to have them solve problems and streamline effects of the line the workers at the assembly line are only able to implement it because the bourgeoisie contracted it they certainly didnt invent it and if they did they sold themselves short the workers at the engineering firm saw increased productivity due to technology as well with the advent of the computer they no longer had to rely on archaic time consuming methods of course the only reason they didnt have to rely on those methods anymore was because the bourgeoisie of the engineering firm saw an opportunity to increase productivity with technology the capitalist creates the productivity because productivity is time and money
socialism,not_removed,agreed ultimately only the abolishment of wage labor classes states and money can fix it all the current problems
socialism,not_removed,again economically of course thats all affordable the wealth exists the problem is that most of that wealth is in the hands of a tiny minority of people
socialism,not_removed,fuck off social fascist their eugenics program was aimed at all nonnormal people including lgbtqiapeople women were also sterilized in much higher numbers than men also just sterilizing criminals is fucked up that even strays away from the social democratic line of rehabilitation is someone not going to be allowed to have children because they were caught carrying weed
socialism,not_removed,hey thanks appreciate that i have some friends down there working now and just figured id crash with one of them til i figure it out saving your comment in case d
socialism,not_removed,friends department does occasionally can go
socialism,not_removed,why are you even on this subreddit i know you dont start the grade for a few more weeks but cant you find something better to do than hating on muslims and posting stupid shit like this on an explicitly socialist subreddit
socialism,not_removed,i draw a distinction as most socialists do between work and labour work is the specific phenomenon that occurs under class society in which an individual is forced to exchange their labour to a member of a higher class in order to secure their well being labour is instead the act in itself in which individuals can find meaning or accomplish set tasks it can be very fulfilling but this is not often the case under capitalism because most labour is done as work labour would occur under socialism but work would be abolished
socialism,not_removed,im a workaholicavoidlifer but i still would really appreciate hours off i can just find more work on the side or more chance to improve my skills work on my own projects
socialism,not_removed,god damnit could you be a bit less incisive d
socialism,not_removed,im torn on the one hand it makes people more complacent on the other hand it makes life objectively better for the workers or at least the workers in first world countries
socialism,not_removed,so we should all work hours a day again until the revolution were unions just bread and circuses too any progress is progress even if it isnt a huge one this change is a good one even if it isnt halfway to a socialist society
socialism,not_removed,contract out to an engineering firm so their workers hey certainly didnt invent it and if they did they sold themselves short so you dont know capitalists always steal whatever the workers create its in law because the bourgeoisie of the engineering firm saw an opportunity to increase productivity with technology doubtful the workers are right in there the capitalist the productivity because productivity is time and money sure the workers create for autonomy mastery and purpose ease of work
socialism,not_removed,doesnt matter who controls the money its still a finite resource a basic income of a year to all adults would cost of our current budget with those numbers how would it work even if a majority of people controlled the cash
socialism,not_removed,i work to live but i live to labour
socialism,not_removed,its just a functioning of capitalism you dont have to support or oppose it specifically capital requires it and so the ruling class will continue to put it into action id be happy if it came to my country but id be happier if a revolutionary wave swept through the proletariat
socialism,not_removed,false equivalence unions used to be at least actual revolutionary organisations such as the iww none of these capitalists fit this description and will only give ground to further their own interests in the article feldt actually says that the regulations will make workers focus more intensely on their jobs for example
socialism,not_removed,theyre not the manufacturing plants workers the manufacturing plant is paying for access to the engineering firms workers the manufacturing plant cant point at someone working for the engineering firm and say youre fired only the engineering firm can make that decision capitalists always steal whatever the workers create its in law source doubtful the workers are right in there yes the workers on the assembly line created the software that theyre now reading on their displays as to which things have been packed and where s who am i kidding they created the displays first then the computer then the code for the software that theyre now reading off of if theyre that skilled they wouldnt be working on an assembly line unless it was their choice to do so the capitalist creates the productivity because productivity is time and money exchanging service for payment even if that service is collaboration on a project that will enhance productivity is not stealing you entered willingly you gave your service willingly
socialism,not_removed,i mean im personally not a huge advocate for ubi as i believe we should instead transition to a socialist economy but it goes without saying that taxes for the wealthy would have to be increased accordingly ubi under the current budget seems like a total strawman to me and is surely not what ubi advocates are proposing
socialism,not_removed,most people do use them to mean the same thing but its just within this context that we tend to try and distinguish a difference
socialism,not_removed,the manufacturing plant cant point at someone working for the engineering firm and say youre fired only the engineering firm can make that decision i disagree but what does this have to do with anything source you need a source isnt it common knowledge that the owner owns everything created during the workday if theyre that skilled they wouldnt be working on an assembly line unless it was their choice to do so arent we talking about the earliest assembly lines of course the workers figured it out i realize you must be some sort of elitist but youre not very smart you entered willingly you gave your service willingly there is nothing voluntary in the capitalist model for the worker everything is done under threat
socialism,not_removed,steal a liberals toothbrush of course
socialism,not_removed,probably have a nap abolishing the present state of things is tiring work labour
socialism,not_removed,ride my piebald cob around the roads waving a flag declaring it and trying to get some sort of random party started up in the town
socialism,not_removed,continue the fight against procapitalist reformist and revisionist
socialism,not_removed,get laid then take a nap
socialism,not_removed,hopefully not much diffrent likely get super excited about trying to get more people interested in fully automating production now that employment isnt needed also lobby to get marxist theory taught in schools as its important to understand the basis of society and currently capitalism is taught in schools anyway
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,furiously masturbate
socialism,not_removed,first thing sleep god i need sleep
socialism,not_removed,goes communist what does that mean everyone is suddenly a communist does the entire world turn into a perfect communist society postscarcity anarchy no work no bosses everyone spends their lives doing whatever they want i would start asking a lot of questions about their customs fancy tech and worldview
socialism,not_removed,i would travel the world and work it would be amazing to experience different countries meet new people and i would find an assortment of work country to country
socialism,not_removed,i would begin singing as if it were the highpoint of a musical a la singing in the rain
socialism,not_removed,catch up on sleep
socialism,not_removed,trolling people in public by going to multiple cities on earth and then to mars all in one dayassuming we have the technology to do that
socialism,not_removed,without being a hunter a fisherman a cattle rearer or a critic
socialism,not_removed,thats the spirit i hear youre doing pretty well with your irish socialist revolution tell me all about it mate
socialism,not_removed,you also will have to furiously brush your teeth
socialism,not_removed,alas many new toothbrushes will be stolen from the liberal forces
socialism,not_removed,heres mussolini nsfw edit tagged
socialism,not_removed,i appreciate dead fascist dictators as much as the next guy but you should put a warning on thatfor people who are sensitivethose who are at work
socialism,not_removed,is this available in poster form
socialism,not_removed,this sounds pretty great im curious how youre planning on approaching the idea of black nationalism also im sure that a bunch of pseudoleftists will be angrily throwing settlers at you so be prepared for that and it would probably be worthwhile to respond to the thirdworldist argument as well as the reactionary and liberal ones
socialism,not_removed,what exactly is settlers ive seen it mentioned before
socialism,not_removed,it is a book that tries to make the case that there are no white proletarians in the us it really is just pure liberalism disguised by leftistsounding language
socialism,not_removed,thats not what settlers claims at all thats just what mtws claim
socialism,not_removed,labor leaders betrayal of those they represent to throw in their lot with hillary is some of the most despicable shit ive seen this election talking about the election here not the warmongering and sexual assault that preceded the election whats worse is that it was so fucking obvious that she didnt give a shit she didnt have unions share her spotlight she didnt talk about the strides the unions have made she didnt and hasnt and wont do shit for the unions in return as the article points out and none of them will face consequences for it
socialism,not_removed,if you want change in the endorsement you cant neglect the internal union elections
socialism,not_removed,yeah ok im mad
socialism,not_removed,think about it another way what choice do they have they cant stand with the gop because they will get nothing whatsoever from the hyperindividualist right plus trump will lose and then hillary wont be beholden to them they cant stand with stein or a dedicated labor candidate because americas democracy system only allows two parties and one winner and its not going to be stein stein will lose and so hillary wont be beholden to them there is literally no way for them to make hillary need their support because the republicans have elected not to run a candidate for president however by standing with democrats as they always do they at least have the possibility of mattering in state and municipal elections and so having those candidates be beholden to them those democratic candidates are ostensibly the party which most aligns with their beliefs unless there are good labor candidates at the local level which is the only level where third parties matter their choices are to break in any direction and be irrelevant or to support democrats as they usually do and be not quite irrelevant
socialism,not_removed,meh the afl and cio leadership have always been pretty reactionary what we need are more unions like the iww
socialism,not_removed,theres a lot they could be doing the aflcio in particular has basically given up on organizing their plan seems to be just to minimize membership losses as time goes on its a game of attrition that they are slowly losing labor has all the power in the world if they actually do something think of the millions they waste on democrats that get elected and sabotage unions my own union a teachers union spends millions on the democratic party that has support for charter schools and privatization in their platform the choice that unions face is not endorse hillary or do nothing and frankly if it was just about endorsements and elections they could have endorsed sanders the only actually prounion democrat in decades but which unions did that nnu and seiu i think maybe the longshoreman union not a whole lot is what im getting at but the ones that did are the ones actively organizing and using more militant tactics to achieve their goals what would have happened if in january labor leaders used all their power to get sanders the nomination maybe nothing would have changed but at least they could have fought for someone that maybe just maybe would work to advance their goals because we know hillary wont but they couldnt even do that they couldnt even work to elect the other democrat if they cant even get behind a liberal democrat then i guess were all just fucked and what exactly is trumkas long term plan what will he do when us union membership dips to below i guess the joke is that he has no goals and no plan because he doesnt give a shit and is a willing pawn for the state just like the other bosses
socialism,not_removed,unions could have at least gone all in with bernie in the primary rather than endorsing hillary prematurely imagine if the aflcio and seiu had both thrown their weight money resources volunteers etc behind bernie from the beginning could have actually made a difference
socialism,not_removed,but which unions did that nnu and seiu i think maybe the longshoreman union not a whole lot is what seiu ha ones that did go bernie communications workers largest union one of the most progressive national nurses united national union of health care workers ilwu ila went hillary american postal workers union amalgamated transit union united electrical workers leftwing union
socialism,not_removed,i hope that she goes but whoever replaces her will be tied to the same system cutting off the head doesnt work
socialism,not_removed,who would have guessed that big money interests control a whole country i am shocked guys shockeds
socialism,not_removed,i get the sense that the existence of north korea makes red scare massive in sk effectively preventing any kind of marxismleft movement can any comrade confirm if this is the case

socialism,not_removed,this article doesnt say the half of it that choi is a cult leader and park is part of her cult and was essentially letting choi run the entire government plus that park is the daughter of koreas former dictator who was in the thrall of chois cultleader father
socialism,not_removed,im afraid that very bad things will happen to the people in south korea theres no way any significant transfer of power will be allowed the fascist government will just start killing people and the west will support it
socialism,not_removed,its not even like cutting off the head its more like cutting off one of the hands
socialism,not_removed,its called a figurehead for a reason
socialism,not_removed,that was my exact reaction reading the comments at rworldnews we told you the whole time bourgeois democracy is no democracy at all its nice to see the naiveté of liberals fading away little by little
socialism,not_removed,especially countries as liberal as south korea i mean theres liber in the name that must mean theyre more free right right actual liberistliberal logic s obviously
socialism,not_removed,yeah fair enough but fucking psychics wtf
socialism,not_removed,what is the evidence that its big money interests
socialism,not_removed,historically theres been mass extrajudicial executions of people suspected to support the north ie communists that legacy is still likely felt today though i cant say personally
socialism,not_removed,read up on the jeju uprising if you havent already pretty horrifying stuff
socialism,not_removed,yeah its kind of like permanent fascism
socialism,not_removed,the fact that people actually believe that south korea is a true democracy thats just as free as any western country amazes me all true opposition to the government is banned and freedom of speech and press is extremely limited the support that america and other countries is giving south korea is disgusting
socialism,not_removed,it happens with a lot of translations where smaller words have larger meanings that cant be adequately translated properly particularly if they work together to make a broader meaning
socialism,not_removed,nothing so dramatic is likely other people in parks saenuri party will push her out or marginalize her in practical terms and life will go on
socialism,not_removed,a hand that grows back
socialism,not_removed,getting a hair cut lol a new image but it all grows back and doesnt even harm the system propping it up
socialism,not_removed,naiveté
socialism,not_removed,its nice to see the naiveté of liberals fading away little by little i wish i had your optimism
socialism,not_removed,did you read the article or even the title of the posts about it on rworldnews
socialism,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikijejuuprising
socialism,not_removed,the sad thing is north korea isnt even a socialist certainly not communist country they just use the label to try and gain some legitimacy in terms of wealth gaps and crushing poverty north korea is one of the worst in the world even worse than those that are openly capitalist i would have said they are the worst but there are countries that are currently overrun by warlords somalia and the like
socialism,not_removed,holy fuck
socialism,not_removed,but but the north
socialism,not_removed,neither seoul nor pyongyang
socialism,not_removed,thanks i was relying on swype
socialism,not_removed,when i have seen my friends radicalize on their own and become better friends with me as a result then it becomes much easier for me to be optimistic we have a lot of liberal and dissatisfied friends ready to radicalize and i work to educate them everyday
socialism,not_removed,the articles seem to describe more of a creepy cult leader exploiting his influence over the dictators daughter to get rich and then the cult leaders daughter using the nowpresident daughter of the dictator in the same way nowhere does it seem like they got influence through being rich rather than got rich through influence the influence is said to have come from the cult leader claiming to be able to speak with the dead mother of the nowpresident also look at the people listed in the cabal a personal trainer and a guy who designs handbags thats not big money
socialism,not_removed,did you because it doesnt seem like it

socialism,not_removed,the dprk is preferable at this point
socialism,not_removed,nice
socialism,not_removed,well at least theyre making fewer false pretenses about their intentions
socialism,not_removed,nah capitalist democracy is preferable to a hereditary monarchy
socialism,not_removed,in what possible way
socialism,not_removed,you could just look how it changed in actually existing socialist countries
socialism,not_removed,rsocialism is plagued by liberalism defend the dprk
socialism,not_removed,in the way that they are guaranteed food education and healthcare that is the envy of the developing world according to the world health organisation obviously the economic blockade has made life very difficult but i bet you dont know as much about roks current levels of poverty with almost of retired people living in poverty propaganda is a powerful tool
socialism,not_removed,do tell
socialism,not_removed,i dont know what kind of effect it had i just meant that it is possible to know and not just a hypothetical situation since socialist revolutions have happened in christian countries
socialism,not_removed,when you are referencing the left are we speaking of the left in predominately western nations if you are then i think we should look at what the expectations of the western left and their limitations local organizing is infinitely more valuable than foreign organizing when the western left gets involved in foreign causes it inevitably becomes corrupted by competing influences ex i would like to think that foreign aid was largely used to support other nations and improve their quality of life unfortunately this money usually serves geopolitical purposes and the money goes to supporting regimes through their own initiatives continuing from above i would be much happier with a western left that simply did not harm progressive movements in foreign countries ex as a canadian the liberal party is continuing a large sale of military vehicles to saudi arabia instead of cancelling this deal trudeau has allowed it to continue despite human rights abuses something much more achievable would be the forgiveness of world debt this would be a simple action that i believe would unchain foreign governments from poverty and allow them to exists on a similar footing to other nations climate change will be devastating for developing nations the western left must be much more proactive in order to not cripple the developing worlds future the worst impact of climate change will be felt in the developing world and they the least prepared to handle it worse the developed world has disproportionately contributed to climate change there is a cost to this and we must pay it rather simple but the developed world needs to stop killing people who oppose our national interest i am glad that castro made it to the end of his natural life it is unfortunate for all the other nations who we freed and as a result left the region in disarray i am certain that we could find more examples for my to point but i think the gist of them is harm reduction different avenues i think we could pursue are economic environmental and political means once we free the developing world from our oppression then they can guide themselves and work with us as equals as long as they are at our mercy i dont think we will be able to provide proper and lasting support if we are speaking of the left from the developing world then i think all we need to do is look for them and acknowledge their struggle there are progressive movements everywhere looking for recognition and support i do not think we need to intervene or finance them lest they become corrupted by our influence
socialism,not_removed,how do you define the left generally its true that no westerner pays enough attention to those issues its incumbent upon socialists to do so if they wish to maintain a coherent political ideology although many socialist groups could certainly improve in that area
socialism,not_removed,they have a nice way around that they call it tribal socialism and claim that people helped each other but only within their own tribal group which is utter bullshit
socialism,not_removed,i once had someone tell me markets are natural because if they fix a door for a little old lady neighbor and then she gives them cookies thats a market exchange and isnt that beautiful to which i was like yes its beautiful but unless she promised you x number of cookies beforehand theres no contract and thats a gift economy this was a not a concept they seemed able to grasp
socialism,not_removed,i always do its not that they refute it or get angry but they do what everyone tends to do assume anyone born before is a fairy tale and was a backwards bumpkin people call each other cavemen even though cavemen didnt live in caves and they werent dumb
socialism,not_removed,because its not a tradition
socialism,not_removed,do not be alarmed citizen there is nothing to worry about there are peacekeepers being dispatched to your location
socialism,not_removed,have they tried not being a piece of shit
socialism,not_removed,pick up that can
socialism,not_removed,❄ 🍑
socialism,not_removed,maybe they shouldnt be a piece of shit then
socialism,not_removed,its not censoring when the mods do it its loving guidance from the vanguard of socialism
socialism,not_removed,dont you know the moderation team at rsocialism is under the ironfisted rule of a shrill sjw and her string of beta white knights its part of the international cuckspiracy to suppress the free speech of brave upholders of reactionary shitheadism individual liberty such as yourself the reign of terror must cease least we all find ourselves under the crushing oppression of the gynocracy s
socialism,not_removed,same reason why dissenters are banned from rthedonald

socialism,not_removed,i have no idea whats going on in this post
socialism,not_removed,socialism is the leftwing of fascism edit leftcom joke thought i wouldnt have to put the s oh well i tried
socialism,not_removed,we dont tell people that the proles cant know the secrets of socialism or else they will know that it only works on paper because of human nature
socialism,not_removed,jesus camp was such an uncomfortable film to watch
socialism,not_removed,yes same what makes somone a peice of shit i know the people who were censored and i dont think they are a peice of shit can a mod please explain what a peice of shit is posting in multiple reactionary subreddits such as rtumblrinaction and rthedonald among others nice sockpuppet account by the way

socialism,not_removed,i watched one of my friends go from semiliberal to full on globalistrothbardsdidit alex jones fanboy if anything youtube was the tipping point shits fucked up
socialism,not_removed,im in the same boat i have a best friend who openly acknowledges and admits to not caring about the economic inequality oppression exploitation suffering death etc capitalism causes he admits hes selfish and rather enjoys the luxuries capitalism has to offer and aims for a wealthy lifestyle i have no idea how you challenge that kind of mentality and just goes to show that even people who are fully conscious and aware dont give a shit
socialism,not_removed,hes not a libertarian hes an authoritarian twat taking on the cloaks of libertarianism because youd rather not think that ill of him
socialism,not_removed,do his views affect your friendship if you cant stand being friends with someone with differing views then you should should just stop being friends with him because trying to change him is selfish imo however youve known him for ten years and i assume gotten close with him and you know that hes a good person so id look past any disagreements and continue to be friends
socialism,not_removed,it seems like youtube is a breeding ground for captialist libertarian weirdness leftie youtube really needs to up its game so a few random kids stumble upon class consciousness instead id try if i knew more about both socialism and youtube at this point glad for the few who exist though
socialism,not_removed,this is my experience as well i dont think cops are bad people generally but boy does it seem like being in the police force brainwashed you to be a fascist which makes sense when you consider their daily experience they see the effects of capitalism on people and deal with the people that capitalism has damaged every day its easy to ascribe their criminality to personal failings if you dont already have a solid understanding of what causes people to be the way they are combine that with the authoritarian hierarchical and mikitaristic nature of policing being forced to uphold unjust laws an atmosphere that shuns and mocks leftist views without understanding them some toxic masculinity and you got yourself a fascist stew cookin
socialism,not_removed,hes always been more conservariveright leaning then myself when we met in college so i figured it wouldve been a long shot to talk him otherwise he scoffs at the term class traitors in reference to my coworker throwing me under the bus on a recent job or really anything having to do with comsocial values everyone worked hard for what they have and its theirs blah blah im not in the mindset to fix him or anything but more so upset that a good friend of mine would be so anciently feudal minded
socialism,not_removed,man i feel you its weird especially that it makes me question the friendship entirely i mean ethics and the like are serious judgements of character but the guys been a really good friend it baffles me how a person can be both at the same time
socialism,not_removed,such people feel secure in the belief that it will never happen to them it being the general losing control of ones life that happens so easily under capitalism or else worse actually wanting something more than selfish materialism can offer i think we as socialists have to accept that there are some people who we will not be able to convince these are the ones we will simply have to fight if someone straightup doesnt value human life and dignity then theres nothing to say what matters at that point is keeping them away from the levers of power by any means necessary
socialism,not_removed,the only reason i called him a libertarian is he defined himself as one but hes very much more pro private property and ownership then social equality
socialism,not_removed,weve definitely gotten pretty close to it and decided to absolutely not speak of politics ever it just bothers me the two different paths were on and how opposite our world views are
socialism,not_removed,i know see i may have painted a terrible picture of my friend but i can say hes honestly a great man and a best friend in so many regards i too have questioned the friendship and him as a person because of political beliefs how cant you yknow it makes me think of the dark side of revolution and radical change i cant imagine family members close friends and loved ones being torn away or even killed over it
socialism,not_removed,explain to him the real definition of libertarian and that what he believes in is the exact opposite of what the word means
socialism,not_removed,libertarians are on the social equity side not social equality theres s fundamental difference
socialism,not_removed,ive had the same thoughts especially after him joining the force is there going to be a time when peoples loyalties will be tested and to which side will they ultimately migrate to i mean this last election was a pretty low key but introductory example my thoughts on certain family members changed significantly this past year on that alone
socialism,not_removed,exactly its hard to not judge someone on their political beliefs it really is and even enough to cause serious damage and fighting it says so much about you your ignorance empathy openmindedness etc thats why i fell in love with this movement more then any it just wants to reward empower and provide for the people to the people who tell me not to judge someone for political beliefs explain to me how im suppose to just accept a fascist or a nazi how can i coexist and respect the freedom to those seeking to oppress and do the opposite of coexist its a sad reality and why i just want to enter more relationships with people likeminded
socialism,not_removed,i never understood the idea of dont let politics get in the way of a friendship honestly as if your idea of how people should live doesnt define some major aspects of your character to me it sounds like liberal nonsense coming from people who dont have much to lose who dont perceive that any change in policy would affect them much for whom politics are just theoretical ideas to be entertained i can be friends with liberalsdemocrats because most of them still actually care about other people fundamentally would like some more leftie friends tho too but im hardpressed to tolerate rightlibertarians for much longer than minutes i tried it once but then the guy went full might makes right when i brought up colonialism nope cant do it not enough hours in the daaaay
socialism,not_removed,iceland has a pretty young populace willing to learn new things although we like the americans generally for the chocolate they brought during the second world war
socialism,not_removed,you should put your focus right where you are revolution is going to happen everywhere so theres no point saying it seems closest hear so lets put all our eggs in this basket the best thing you can do for building socialism is work in your cityareacountry
socialism,not_removed,the us might be more sympathetic than you think but it wont happen anytime soon due to the massive corporations who would never allow it
socialism,not_removed,i think least sympathetic to leftism would probably be south korea considering they seem to think from a thread ages ago in the korean subreddit anything left of thatcher is kim jong il
socialism,not_removed,least any nation like taiwansouth korea that has a rival that claims to be communist these nations are very hostile to it simply because they see their enemy and merge communism with it they also have corporations with far too much power exiled populations groups that have grievances with communist in name at least states are also very hostile to leftism in general unlikely nations like the usa that are practically oligarchies with corporations having heavy influence on the media and the population people from these nations may not be hostile to socialism but tend to be very ignorant of it kinda nationspeople being oppressed such as the palestinekurdish people since capital doesnt reach this places they tend to simply just use a socialist or atleast social democracy philosophy to run the country hostile neighbors could wipe them out however most nations like icelandnepal where there is no real tension between neighbors and capital has limited presence or the population is hostile to capital for historical reasons nepal communist party recently won a election and i have heard the icelandic people are paying for the crimes of the rich mostly connected to the crash icelands connections to the eu may prevent to much change however
socialism,not_removed,italy spain greece seem pretty red to me long socialistcommunist histories in all three of them
socialism,not_removed,mexico is overall a conservative nation quite religious in full neoliberalism for the last years within it northern mexico is full of protofascists classism and adoration of the us and the mighty job creators central méxico méxico city etc are more akin to your typical liberals with their trust in social democracy as the great bringer of change as always those social democrats are hypocrites and opportunists protecting the system the mexican deep south is poorer and has quite a revolutionary history so theres quite a prevalence of socialist ideologies and indigenous empowerment there colombia and chile are interesting cases both have been the closest american allies in southamerica although the young chilean population is starting to protest the legacy of pinochet and the chicago boys
socialism,not_removed,most probably southeast asia least probably the uscanada
socialism,not_removed,for north american standards québec in many ways we are more liberal read leftist than states like vermont and shit huge student population in montréal tradition of agitating successfully for social democratic reforms huge protests also the wsf just ended here lot of immigrants but comparatively much less islamophobia compared to other western countries also maybe the fact that french canada was historically a lesser settler nation compared to the anglos has created some type of consciousness as well
socialism,not_removed,due to their economic situation and the preponderance of wahhabis the gulf arab states are probably the least receptive to socialism
socialism,not_removed,i think norway has quite a lot of potential for a leftistsocialist future but the problem is so many norwegians already think this is a socialist country i think if a truly demsoc or marxist parties gets in or wins there could be some serious potential but it seems that social democracy has done what liberalism did in north america convince people their ideology is the finest and the ultimate and the new socialism so they believe theyve already achieved socialism over all though socialist ideas are met with warmth and understanding and i get taken much more seriously here than in canada
socialism,not_removed,to be honest i would place the uk where i live nearer the top of the list the labour party is our left leaning party and has been one of the two dominant political parties here for the most part of the century tony blair changed the face of the party recently but the previous leaders were self described socialists ed milliband and jeremy corbyn as well as many previous leadershigh ranking members were by many estimates to the left of socialism ken livingston who was mayor of london and tony benn there was even interest from trotskyists in the and which is pretty remarkable considering how popular and dominant a political party it is here in britain
socialism,not_removed,in us major cities in northeast and west coast are usually center left but most other places are far right labor relations and general knowledge are increasingly worse and i dont see it improving will probably move soon as i can sad but predictable outcome will likely be a few hyper futuristic areas with vast slums
socialism,not_removed,county limerick isnt bad you have some serious depravation and lack of education in vast parts of the city though so its difficult to communicate some things but most seem to be up for the general idea you have a lot of conservitives in the south and east of the county but the west of the county are fairly dissatisfied with the status quo if you exclude adare a lot of the property in the city is owned by people in the east and south of the county and adare which i believe is the main difference in such a small area the aaa are doing great work in parts of the city but we have no socialist representative in our electoral area so i couldnt vote for them im in the eastern side of the county
socialism,not_removed,id guess that the united states is generally the least sympathetic
socialism,not_removed,easily catalonia you cant step feet inside of it without seeing some kind of leftist graffiti i am particularly familiar with this since my family was staying right outside of the city and we saw tons of signs for arran
socialism,not_removed,the pirate party gets a lot of support there and they seem decent
socialism,not_removed,how hard is it to move out there
socialism,not_removed,parts of the us working class are very sympathetic to socialism especially if you dont mention the words marxism or socialism hell many people under dont care if you do mention marx or socialism so things are definitely on the upswing even though opposition is still strong here
socialism,not_removed,the us might be more sympathetic than you think right frame class war in populist terms and youve often got lots of conservative white rural people on your side in no time in my experience
socialism,not_removed,plus the us probably has the greatest percentage of oppressed peoples who would benefit most from socialism
socialism,not_removed,especially the anarchism in athens
socialism,not_removed,many selfdescribed socialists in the labour party are very far from it including ed for example jim murphy former leader of labour in scotland often said he was a socialist in reality he was probably more right wing than blair
socialism,not_removed,what not cuba or india or kurdistan or mexico or southeast asia or scandinavia corbyn is just a social democrat though more radical than other social democrats he really isnt calling for anything socialist and miliband was barely even left of center
socialism,not_removed,to be honest i would place the uk where i live nearer the top of the list so a country in wich the conservatives won the last electionseven to the point that they dont need a partner anymore in wich austerity is the standart and in wich the poor are in dire times should be near the top of the list for most leftwing countries because of are you even for real
socialism,not_removed,i dont even know where to begin with this the labour party is our left leaning party and has been one of the two dominant political parties here for the most part of the century the labour party is left leaning in the same way that the democrats are left leaning tony blair changed the face of the party recently blair is only one person and as we have seen following the election of jeremy corbyn to labour leader one person cannot change the entire nature of a political party blair is not responsible for transforming the labour party from a socialist party into an antiworking class neoliberal party the labour party was never a socialist party blair was merely a symptom of the ongoing degeneration of the labour party from a traditional social democratic party into a neoliberal one but the previous leaders were self described socialists ed milliband and jeremy corbyn neither of those people are socialists being a self described socialist means nothing especially when you consider that tony blair said in a letter to michael foot like many middle class people i came to socialism through marxism to be more specific through deutschers biography of trotsky there was even interest from trotskyists in the and which is pretty remarkable considering how popular and dominant a political party it is here in britain trotskyists have a tendency to join social democratic parties its not something thats unique to labour of the uk the militant tendency that youre referring to were quite influential in the labour party until they were expelled in the just goes to show how socialist our precious labour party really is recommended reading
socialism,not_removed,yeah youre probably right i lived there when i was little and through familyfriends know many anticapitalist brits irl
socialism,not_removed,pirate politics are also a potential gateway into socialist politics copyright and patents are essentially a crutch for capitalism in the information era they are understood to be a social burden but how would individuals be compensated for intellectual work without them the answer is socialism
socialism,not_removed,the younger generation is a goldmind of good thoughts i say give iceland time and see what comes if any theres any western european country id say something socialist could happen in itd be there my real father is from reykjavik and lives there now he isnt a leftist by any means but he sees the influence i do worry that they are becoming a standard social democracy though the pirates and leftgreen are rising in popularity to fight the independence party their only rightwing party with any meaningful representation but their liberal party is now revived and polling in range to get spots and slowly rising i just hope it doesnt turn into an fdrlike saving capitalism so socialism doesnt come to the forefront currently the pirates and independence party swap back and forth from most support in polls but if the pirates and leftgreens form an alliance with someone else they can take the majority i think the independence party are aligned with the progressives the ones the panama papers outed as the majority coalition the progressives have dropped like a rock in support since but since independence are the only real rightwing party for rightwingers to support theyve been unhurt in polls i just hope it means no one will want to work with them to form their coalition because of their alliance with the progressives i dont live there only my dad does so i dont know whats buzzing around personally as far as support i just get what i know from online and what he tells me i dont know really anything about any socialist parties in iceland however they love to protest there so please correct me if im wrong on anything
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,at the time marx lived russia was essentially a feudal society with hardly any modern industry so while obviously there were massive class struggles and poverty it wasnt the same per se
socialism,not_removed,marx was speaking from a time when capitalism hadnt fully superseded all other modes of production
socialism,not_removed,makes for an interesting read
socialism,not_removed,i dont recall him specifically saying russia would be the last country but there was an implication that russia was the last european country marx thought that the most industrious countries would revolt firstie germany france england america also the russian revolution wasnt socialist it was more a socialist by name progressive revolution the soviet union was just a state capitalist country the class structure didnt change the private capitalist was thrown out to be replaced by a party or government bureaucrat this is what led to the collapse of the union in the early
socialism,not_removed,hell many people under dont care if you do mention marx or socialism yeah it turns out people who werent subjected to mccarthy era propaganda are more open to the concept of socialism
socialism,not_removed,anarchism is huge in spain
socialism,not_removed,here in the states every time someone comments on obama or clinton being marxist i cry inside
socialism,not_removed,i think canada still hasnt moved past being a dominion we export mostly resources and so its natural for us to ask how high when an exploiter asks us to jump
socialism,not_removed,jim murphy is a disaster
socialism,not_removed,just as a sidenote it should say rojava and bakur not kurdistan in general iraqi kurdistan is to a large part deeply patriachal and feudalistic
socialism,not_removed,conservatives got of the vote at the last election and i feel certain in saying that if labour hadnt lost so many votes to ukip and the snp because of blairs ruination of the party then they would have a solid majority now people are sick of centrist politics so a rise in support of socialist candidates like corbyn alongside fascists like farage is expected
socialism,not_removed,in fact many americans are hostile to their own class interest yep the fact that so many americans fall for the nonsense of the libertarians for example just baffles me when everything he advocates for is going to make quality of life worse
socialism,not_removed,exactly they hold delusions that reform would come from either a free market or essentially welfare state capitalism unaware of the class conflict both situations would share most people seem deluded in general it can never happen here were still number one the system is still fair religious rambling about it all working out etc i think youre spot on brazil light if were lucky i think some of the more progressive cities will attempt drastic reforms comparatively but the class conflict between the cities suburbs and rural fringes will ultimately collapse it all since they wont be on the same page
socialism,not_removed,not to mention that intellectual work is better without the oppression of capital as weve discovered with verifiable and repeated scientific studies over the past years
socialism,not_removed,sounds promising at the very least also goldmind of good thoughts was that intentional
socialism,not_removed,hello this is your not automated reminder uinternationalism should answer your question
socialism,not_removed,regardless of whether you think the ussr was socialist or not the october revolution absolutely was
socialism,not_removed,but muh truth dollars
socialism,not_removed,do you live there i spent a week in barcelona partly with a historian of the civil war its seemed to me anarchists were killed and marginalized so much during the dictatorship that not many people talk about it now but i did meet some and visited anarchist bookstores and cafes too
socialism,not_removed,thats probably helping to some extent republicans saying obama was a socialist when he wasnt has stripped a lot of that words power from most liberals and probably laid the groundwork for bernie sanders to run as a selfproclaimed socialist and not get laughed out of the room
socialism,not_removed,but really once we get independence i feel scotland could be near the top of the list of countries sympathetic to leftism we were at the centre of old school labour and as independence is supported mostly by the left once we achieve that hopefully the passion wil be moved onto real socialist ideas
socialism,not_removed,their thinking roughly equates to socialismmore taxes more taxesmore government socialismmore government not even remotely true by the very definition of a stateless or classless society but thats roughly what it comes down to since the phrase has been hijacked i find if i explain to them the necessity of delegating basic needs and wants separately they tend to understand it better the concept of shared resources is foreign to them because the nature of the society itself is based on selfserving and because of that they automatically think anything public is stateowned and therefore bad im really not sure how to explain it in different terms at this point either most will understand the necessity of safety nets for a stable society for instance but will scoff at the idea of providing food to the poor because it destroys their incentive to better their situation as if starving people somehow become more productive
socialism,not_removed,yeah icelandic politics are some of my favorite to follow even if i wasnt bias due to my relation to the country no no it wasnt lol
socialism,not_removed,im not trying to take away from anyone who is sympathetic to socialism but i want to make the point that being sympathetic doesnt mean actuality people who are sympathetic to the left or socialism specifically doesnt define them as the left or socialists they can just as easily be against us as for us for example social democrats were sympathetic to the social and economic conditions of the working class socialism and social welfare programs in germany during the uprisings after world war one the social democrats went on to betray the working class people snitched on the whereabouts of rosa luxemburg a comrade and became collaborates with the freikorps a pangerman reactionary force they continued capitalism only to have the great depression occur within a decade spawning the nazis and judenhass we all know the story from there
socialism,not_removed,my mother is from there and considers herself one from time to time i go for extended stays almost every year
socialism,not_removed,scottish socialism is usually whitewashed quite a bit by british labour they say the first socialist mp was keir hardie but leave out the facts that keir was a staunch supported of scottish home rule and that the first actual socialist mp was rc graham and of the nsp precursor to the snp they also never talk about john maclean or jimmy reid because they want to conveniently ignore their support for scottish independence
socialism,not_removed,it was william mackenzie king who made reforms btw not bennet
socialism,not_removed,problem with scottish independence is it is just filled with petty nationalism and have slimy parties like the snp leading it
socialism,not_removed,in what way is it filled with petty nationalism
socialism,not_removed,the nationalism of the independence movement is no more petty than the nationalism of the unionists opposing independence because nationalism is bad is perhaps the most ridiculous case for the union ive ever heard
socialism,not_removed,not sure i know any movies that would convert a liberal but there are a few with leftist themes try che parts and or edit you can also search try httpswwwredditcomrsocialismsearchqsocialistmoviesrestrictsronsortrelevancetall as this has been asked before
socialism,not_removed,the grapes of wrath is a classic
socialism,not_removed,chomsky has a documentary on netflix thats called requiem for the american dream the take documentary mad max fury road
socialism,not_removed,the big short was not anticapitalist per se but it shows the horror and stupid greed of wall street and banking in general plus its a great movie in terms of being enjoyable to watch
socialism,not_removed,check out the director ken loach ive only seen his movie bread and roses about janitors striking in la but he also made a movie about the spanish civil war and is a socialist himself so im sure hes made more films with socialist themes there is also this old italian film titled the organizer i remember liking my brother recently watched pans labyrinth and he told me it took place near the end of the spanish civil war and the protagonist might have been a republican fighter check that out maybe though it might not be very socialist
socialism,not_removed,watch the motorcycle diaries as soon as possible
socialism,not_removed,society of the spectacle its a classic
socialism,not_removed,ill check these films out thanks comrades
socialism,not_removed,fight club to me it was more of a nihilistprimmy film there seems to be a lot more rightwing bro fans of the film than socialists matewan httpsenwikipediaorgwikimatewan would probably be a good film
socialism,not_removed,snowpiercer seems to have an antisocialist message i just wrote up an analysis on it
socialism,not_removed,if anyone needs access to the take pm me
socialism,not_removed,oh fuck i forgot they live the greatest movie ever made
socialism,not_removed,accelerationism does not work trump will only slow us down and empower fascistseven if trump cant employ the worst of what he wants he will still enact terrible policies that will have drastic consequences he will only serve to legitimize the rise of the far rightnot start a socialist revolution
socialism,not_removed,if youre a straight cis white guy who can blend in with rightists accelerationism sort of makes sense
socialism,not_removed,i dont really understand how accelerationism is supposed to work will the proletariat revolt against fascism fascism gives people jobs a strong and prideful identity and clearly defines the root cause of their struggle to those whom it enthralls it is a blessing not a curse and they have little reason to turn against it i doubt trump or other modern neofascists will deliver but they are successfully delivering and it will only result in seeping further and further into fascism not revolution
socialism,not_removed,accelerationists are probably correct in the sense that a crisis situation is needed for revolution to have a chance but heres the thing capitalism produces crises on its own all the time why waste time effort and the goodwill of the people working to create something that will happen whether we want it to or not crisis isnt enough if it were wed have had major revolutions in the us after the great depression or the crash we also need an organized revolutionary classparty to take advantage of that crisis and the best way to organize and radicalize people is to work with them which means doing what we can to make peoples lives a little bit better even though we know capitalism will be right behind us tearing down what little we manage to build which isnt saying vote for democrats i dont think a trump presidency necessarily constitutes a crisis weve had plenty of terrible republican presidents before but whoever the president is socialists need to be on the ground resisting the evil shit they do
socialism,not_removed,it is both a great way for organised socialist groups to appear ineffectual or uncaring and a great way for fascism to take root as a group we should be the first to stand up for the rights of the proletariat not sabotaging them
socialism,not_removed,dumb
socialism,not_removed,as uncomfortable as it is to admit would the revolutions in russia china and even catalonia happen if civilizations was not in chaos even if a trump presidency caused a successful leftwing fightback in the usa im afraid russia and china are just waiting to takeover as the new hegemonic capitalistimperialist powers
socialism,not_removed,the last consolation of someone who has given up that it offers a tiny bit of comfort is the best thing i can say for it
socialism,not_removed,its working out fine in britian right now s
socialism,not_removed,how do you know it doesnt work as far as i know it hasnt really been tried anywhere and if fascists take control would class consciousness not rise why would the likelihood of a revolution not increase someone else in this thread fairly mentioned that russia and china had to fall into absolute chaos before revolution i feel like the us would too
socialism,not_removed,after the great depression the only thing that actually stopped revolution was social security robert mcnamara even if it was before his time said as much in fog of war we were on the brink of serious shit the only reason we didnt have one and we havent yet is because the fact that welfare is pretty much made to give the poor and working class just enough money that theyre not literally dying but they cant live on it either but they feel mildly content with whats being received at least enough to not revolt i know me and my family have experienced this and i dont think its limited to only me cause ive heard similar things from others
socialism,not_removed,care to explain
socialism,not_removed,but they also had a militant movement before the revolutioncrisis its not like franco started his revolution and all of the sudden there was a massive militant labor movement there was several general strikes in russia which led to the organizing of the working class before world war one started
socialism,not_removed,if fascists take control they just murder people class consciousness doesnt rise nothing does
socialism,not_removed,can you explain to me how destitution would translate into class consciousness and not further goddamn these mexican and muslims theyve ruined the american way let alone the other groups usually targeted
socialism,not_removed,well that was depressing true but depressing
socialism,not_removed,i know that in germany the kids are taught about the holocaust and i was wondering if the same happens in british schools about the indian holocaust or any other story of colonization by their nation
socialism,not_removed,not really id say the first i learnt in any detail about the british empire was at alevel when i learnt about the indian national movement alevels are the last thing we do before university and people generally take only or subjects so only those particularly interested in history learn this before that id learnt a lot about the world wars and the interwar period so the british empire was regularly mentioned but there was never any detail about the conditions under british rule or much like that when i learnt about india british rule was definitely portrayed as negative but i dont remember ever specifically learning about the extent of the famine and such i didnt take history further than that so i cant say anything about degreelevel history
socialism,not_removed,update an old friend came through in the end my pup has a safe spot to be for a day maybe two so next i guess ill be looking at pet friendly rooms for rent that should be fun thanks for the comments
socialism,not_removed,puget sound area or portland area i feel you comrade alas we already have a foster dog besides our own in our studio apartment from a tenant that was evicted in our building we are holding her while her owner is looking for housing are you working directly for the warehouse or are you going the permatemp route pm me if there are any questions i can answer for you
socialism,not_removed,i dont know about where you are in the nw but some homeless shelters will keep pets
socialism,not_removed,its a full time schedule trial period then benefits and pay increase after a while im actually looking forward to be working again but this typical corporate min wage laborer work is the antithesis of what i was looking for but friends offered it and i didnt have any alternatives so its full time min wage for me
socialism,not_removed,portland metro area
socialism,not_removed,actually warehouses are where you want to be organize the supply chain stay out of the ngos
socialism,not_removed,theres always the coast guard in summers youll be retired
socialism,not_removed,you should find fellow comrades have you visited the portland branch of the iww they could help
socialism,not_removed,good thing they have million job openings
socialism,not_removed,i agree unionize
socialism,not_removed,most of them are but theres some that still hold on to some socialist tendencies although theyre few and far between
socialism,not_removed,over time many of the mainstream socialist and communist parties in the west have gone down the path of revisionism its a sad thing to see but we must struggle against this by joining into actual socialist parties which now exist
socialism,not_removed,we end their exploitation i mean the selfemployed as a category is not really all that straightforward because most of the selfemployed are technically selfemployed but operate in roles like uber drivers where they in fact are working for an exploitative institution but the employment structures of that institution are just built around atomizing their workforce for a variety of reasons taxes preventing organization etc for the few that actually own the means of production for their own purposes well what about them they do still engage in selfexploitation in order to compete and often do employ and exploit others much of the petty bourgeoisie fall into the selfemployed category we have no particular problem with them but they are useless as a revolutionary class because they dont share the conditions of the proletariat
socialism,not_removed,well who are they exploiting im pro small scale production that is to say private ownership of means of production but not employment we live in an age of printers home workshops home breweries and many other forms of single person labour i like the idea where small ideas like these could spread into cooperatives if more people are interested and can add something to the project ultimately there is an arguement for calling it personnel property over private property as the owner is the sole user
socialism,not_removed,they are workers and own their own means of production forcing them into a union and making them share their personal property would violate their freedom of association
socialism,not_removed,whats the goal society were talking about here otherwise if were just cooperativizing all business the status of the selfemployed would presumably remain the same a cooperative enterprise with only one employeeowner theyd just presumably have access to a lot more social services and security than currently maybe it would make sense to have some kind of elected council for any category of selfemployed workers who can act on things that are in all of their interest or organize agreements and standards among members
socialism,not_removed,they dont share the conditions of the proletariat that varies though the likes of me my friends boyfriend and his family and near half the population of my locality have no employees but may own tools small machines and work shops or farm our exploiters are those we supply but we enjoy none of the security of standard employment i dont make minim wage a lot of the time some of the farmers never have unless they have outside employment or a larger farm better equipment i think the identifying factor is weither or not some one has employees
socialism,not_removed,ultimately there is an arguement for calling it personnel property over private property as the owner is the sole user its not much of an argument its a fact private property doesnt exist unless there is another person involved in the relationship with the property like an employee
socialism,not_removed,they are exploiting themself or maybe a better way of putting it is that their capital exploits them the proceeds from their labor are reinvested into their business expanding their investment in capital to keep up with the competition capital doesnt valorize itself it must expand via the selling of labor power whether it is the labor power of the owner or the labor power the owner hires fundamentally they work the same way capital is dead labor which vampirelike lives only by sucking living labor and lives the more the more labor it sucks
socialism,not_removed,what is this liberalism why are we worried about the rights of the petty bourgeoisie
socialism,not_removed,a business owner with out employees and with out private property is a union of one person why shouldnt this person have the rig ht to freely associate with whoever they please how can they possibly be classified as petty bourgeoisie if they dont own private property
socialism,not_removed,i would like to know this as well how is what woahgeez just stated in anyway relevant to the petitebourgeois
socialism,not_removed,they do own private property their business i explain further in my above comment
socialism,not_removed,tell me what kind of business doesnt involve the ownership of private property not to mention that the natural rights model is extraordinarily flawed being antimaterialist
socialism,not_removed,a business ran by one person or a business equally owned by everyone the business is their personal property in a capitalist society it is also considered private property because capitalism doesnt recognize a difference between personal and private property
socialism,not_removed,the revolution betrayed
socialism,not_removed,
socialism,not_removed,im curious about this too
socialism,not_removed,idk much about laos i think it followed a similar line as vietnam though for vietnam by a vietnamese communist
socialism,not_removed,you are correct laos is vietnam but it has an international policy of isolationism as apposed to vietnam looking for foreign connection
socialism,not_removed,north shore antifa is the established antifa group for that region thank you for the headsup comrade uncle ho
socialism,not_removed,it is incredibly outstanding of jacobin to release this for free its a great resource and it shows that very highquality products dont necessarily have to come out of a profitcentered system
socialism,not_removed,wasnt this always available
socialism,not_removed,is there a way that i can get a bulk number of paper or hard copies of this for a cheaper price than they are currently being marketed at like if i could get somewhere in the ballpark of a hundred of them for a decent price that would be amazing
socialism,not_removed,this is awesome
socialism,not_removed,looks great there really needs to be more introductory content like this out there directing newcomers to literature written years ago is probably overwhelming for a lot of them
socialism,not_removed,between this and das capital comic ill have to sell my kidney to afford to print them
socialism,not_removed,just look it up as a pdf file its a wonderful symbol but the book has been free all along
socialism,not_removed,just read this a week or two ago im a newbie to socialism but it wad a great first read for me edit typo
socialism,not_removed,last time i saw it for free was on valentines day idk if its always been free though
socialism,not_removed,yeah i thought the same thing i got my copy for free a while ago and it wasnt a holiday or anything
socialism,not_removed,i feel like it was too this is like the top three things i tell people to read when getting to know socialism and i feel like ive linked the pdf numerous times throughout the last year
socialism,not_removed,for an order like that id contact jacobin directly they offer for and id be willing to bet that theyd work something out for an order of you can reach them at editorjacobinmagcom
socialism,not_removed,not that its at all the same thing but crimethinc has stickers and pamphlets they will send for the cost of shipping
socialism,not_removed,the pdf is available for free today itll be available for free tomorrow and it was free yesterday but still
socialism,not_removed,my point exactly i didnt come to read this for info ive been on board since the but im always looking for something to give to someone to teach them and this is terrible i couldnt make it more than a few paragraphs through the red text on white in small columns with no explanation of its structure
socialism,not_removed,it was discounted on valentines day
socialism,not_removed,exactly my thoughts when i saw this post
socialism,not_removed,can you really get for their httpswwwjacobinmagcomtheabcsofsocialism is for maybe they have wholesale rates for nonprofit use or something
socialism,not_removed,httpswwwjacobinmagcomstore scroll to the bottom it says bulk rate is for copies
socialism,not_removed,it also says the price for one is sh discount at the moment
socialism,not_removed,i did get an email from them a while ago about them being discounted but it was only for that specific day maybe they extended it
socialism,not_removed,absolutely not if someone tells you that they do run far away and fast
socialism,not_removed,some probably do but tbh i find them counterproductive and antithetical to advancing towards communism if communism is a mode of production where labor is lifes prime want does it make sense to punish people with forced labor which reinforces the bourgeois idea that labor is a punishment and to be despised the fact is communism cannot be reached through a generalized coercion of the masses of intermediate elements only through long ideological and class struggle struggleunitytransformation can social relations be transformed not by breaking stone in a camp reason why im a mlm most mls do not understand this and wish to mechanically transpose and fetishize mistakes of the past instead of learning from them oh and also its probably just edgy mls thinking theyre being funny by saying hahahahahaha go to
socialism,not_removed,rehabilitation over punishment
socialism,not_removed,ive worked over hours a day in a hot cramped cruise ship galley getting fed hot dogs and unused buffet crap and sharing a sq foot room with other workers i wasnt protected by any labor laws at least none that would be enforced and got paid a day i lived under constant threat of being abandoned at the next port if i was fired i took this horrid abuse because i was homeless and knew that a young man on the streets of baltimore will end up in prison one way or another would i send the old white people who profited from and enjoyed these cruises to a gulag absolutely
socialism,not_removed,correct me if im wrong but didnt the vast majority of gulag prisoners leave alive i mean prison labour isnt exactly uncommon
socialism,not_removed,no socialist should be in favor of horrific death camps stalin is a traitor to the entire socialist movement for imprisoning gays
socialism,not_removed,im not gonna lie id send most reactionaries and exploiters to a gulag without question that said i think itd be better for society and criminals to spend their time doing useful and reparative work as in giving back whatever hurt they might have done within a rehabilitation program that reintroduces people into the socialist societies and ideologies of cooperation and equality etc
socialism,not_removed,well i believe its a good idea for certain people to be temporarily removed from mainstream society and i believe that certain activities including work but also therapy and recreation should be mandatory in that facility i probably wont use a russian word to describe it because that makes no sense but call it what you want
socialism,not_removed,only when there is a fascist threat not too far away stalins dickery was in reaction to the rise of fascism leading to his paranoia and crackdowns i dont exactly approve of them but when theres multiple states that desire to exterminate bolshevism and slavs i dont blame stalin really for being so paranoid dissenters couldve been nazi spies and party revisionists would only create more vulnerability
socialism,not_removed,gulags didnt exist because of lenin pretty much every country had work camps
socialism,not_removed,ultimately prisons are needed to deal with some elements of society call them gulags if you want to but giving free classes and putting up peace signs will not deal with fascists and reactionaries the idea of the gulag death camp is propaganda there where extremely hard conditions and poor treatment of prisoners but the purpose of the gulags wasnt to kill
socialism,not_removed,fascists and ancaps need a place to stay
socialism,not_removed,the world that tolerated prison labor has long since died
socialism,not_removed,no gulags as they were were horrible awful camps with inhumane living standards they may have not been concentration camps but i think any treatment that inhumane on such a mass scale is unacceptable reactionaries counterrevolutionaries criminals etc should be rehabilitated and put in a sort of prison system with no cruelty just where they cannot interfere with the revolutiontransition of capitalism to socialism i think through showing the benefits of mutual aid cooperation and using positive reinforcement we can show people that socialism is a viable way forward i guess im a revisionist gulager of sorts
socialism,not_removed,the gulag system was first and foremost an incredibly abusive prison system most prisoners werent political prisoners they were random criminals stalin also oversaw the mass imprisonment of gay men in the gulag system if someone calls themself a socialist but has no issue with slave labor in prisons or locking up gay people steer clear of them edit im all for imprisoning altright militia members and wall street types i just dont think that subarctic prison camps for gay people are a cool idea
socialism,not_removed,we should ask instead if neoliberals believe in them given that there actually is forced labor in usa
socialism,not_removed,um i do but not in the strict sense of what stalin implemented more like a temporary thing for people like reactionaries like fasicsts and the other violent types stalin took it way too far even killing many otherwise valuable comrades in his quest for concentration of his power i suppose its more of a prison than a gulag in the way i think of it though real gulags were quite horrific so run far away from me i guess im in nj usa if that helps
socialism,not_removed,omg brainwashing labor camps
socialism,not_removed,thats what im thinking petty criminals will be rehabilitated capitalists and racistreactionary elements are getting sent to somewhere where they cant fuck with other people
socialism,not_removed,have you seen us prisons they seem to be just fine with forced prison labour
socialism,not_removed,for example what about
socialism,not_removed,realy i though that while not as bad there were forced corrective labor camps
socialism,not_removed,id be damned if anyone asked those who openly supported forced labors in prisons such regardless if they say yes or no theyll be shown how much of a greedy bourgeoisie bootlickers or ignorant they really are
socialism,not_removed,dont worry this sub is full of leftcoms your position is a reasonable one and i agree
socialism,not_removed,lenin made a few regrettable decisions during the civil war but it must be mentioned that richard pipes is infamous in academia for his anticommunist slant he studied alongside robert conquest whos known for blatantly lying about the number of individuals killed under the stalinist state
socialism,not_removed,more like pow camps
socialism,not_removed,this post has been removed if you want to advertise your sub here ask in modmail first preferably with reasons that this new sub wont end up being shit
socialism,not_removed,if it becomes anything like rlabouruk its just going to devolve into rwhitepeoplecomplaining
socialism,not_removed,the audiencia nacional national hearing acts as an exceptional tribunal it was created in before the constitution of in substitution of the tribunal of public order which prosecuted political crimes it is typically crewed by the most reactionary elements in the spanish judicature the jail termw will in all likelihood be suspended if not overturned on appeal to the supreme or constitutional courts or to the echr it is however not the only damage a special disqualification of years means woman wont be able to exercise her profession or access public office or jobs during this time considering that shes a history student hoping to teach which is a civil service position in spain this is major harm this is a good spanish humorous piece about it
socialism,not_removed,i once yelled viva la republica in francos tomb while on a class trip i sort of rolled my eyes when my teacher claimed i could end up in spanish prison maybe should have taken it more seriously
socialism,not_removed,i spat on his grave lol
socialism,not_removed,actually this is an interesting aspect of how many times the creation of public spaces are used more for the benefit of capital than the public times square is a public space but it is used by advertisers to plaster billboards everywhere hardly any native new yorkers want to live or be there its almost exclusively tourists and people looking to scam them public space is not the same as a communal space like say a community garden or something there the space is cultivated and controlled by the community living there and it is not set aside by the state in theory public spaces are meant for the benefit of the public and a lot of the time they are but they also have another purpose of facilitating bourgeois interest or creating monopoly rent the answer to this is to demand our right to not just smaller community spaces but larger metropolitan cities as a whole we are the ones living and working generating profit for the businesses there so we should own the city as much as the means of production this is probably the only way to end systemic problems like gentrification
socialism,not_removed,there are forms of advertising that have emerged in recent years such as fake online reviews ratings for which a ban would be unenforceable to solve this we have to address the root causes of advertising the cause i think is capitals endless drive for expansion as capital accumulates it begins to produce more and therefore needs a larger consumer base hence advertising
socialism,not_removed,this is one reason why i love driving in vermont
socialism,not_removed,i agree advertisements are sensory pollutions of public spaces and basic necessities they aim to manipulate as many as possible into making decisions one wouldnt make under normal circumstances theres a reason so many hate getting ads in the mail or are willing to pay extra money just to avoid ads on certain services there should be no tax for not being influenced by appeals to emotion specifically designed by psychologists to be as effective as possible if there are going to be ads they should purely aim to inform the subject and aid them in making a rational choice if youre going to order some new product you rarely go looking for the advertisement usually youll check out reviews of that product perhaps some test that was performed by an unbiased expert or a website weighing pros and cons providing this type of information in a digestible format is the only way i could see advertisements being useful in a postcapitalist society
socialism,not_removed,removal of advertising from all spaces
socialism,not_removed,not to mention that lots of advertising essentially insults its viewers implying that without x product they have something wrong with them
socialism,not_removed,how would you feel about propaganda instead
socialism,not_removed,it boggles my mind that an entire industry could just never show up for work again and the world would actually get better
socialism,not_removed,advertisements can be really annoying but i dont think that saying you didnt consent to viewing an advertisement on someone elses property or property held in common is a good argument against it if its my home i can paint an advertisement for the potatoes i can give people on the side if i want to if theres a place for public art and i want to draw something that advertises a product why should i be stopped btw how do you expect people to be aware of productsservices without advertising
socialism,not_removed,are we talking commercial advertising or all advertising
socialism,not_removed,i think its fair and right to argue against this kind of profitdriven visual pollution but the argument that i didnt consent to see advertisements is really weak and unhelpful in my opinion
socialism,not_removed,fuck those animated billboards and radio ads that play siren sounds
socialism,not_removed,i shit you not i saw one of those animated ones playing a movie trailer in a city in canada how the fuck is that ok
socialism,not_removed,my partner and i are moving to nyc for career reasons in a few years shes visited the city several times before in the past year and has told me that ill loathe it due to the consumerist nature lets say that ive had quite a few creative discussions with her about how terrible nyc is from a socialist perspective p
socialism,not_removed,yep i think most of us here will understand that and the ultimate goal is of course destroying the system that has flooded us with advertising and the waste of labor that is brands of deodorant its pretty easy to make rules about if it can be seen from the public square it is not permitted though thats what im talking about putting forward as part of the achievable immediate demand for a better society as we work our way to the longterm goal
socialism,not_removed,it answers the common question about how does communism intend to produce so much more than capitalism less wasted labor from market speculation less duplicated labor from capitalist competition brands of deodorant and breakfast cereal less socially harmful labor like advertising and all of the workers freed up from those forms of labor start actually contributing to the social good
socialism,not_removed,you should be stopped because you are acting against the spirit of a public art space if you use it for commercial advertising you can play semantic games to defend your idea of putting advertising in a public art space all day long but it boils down to intellectual honesty and the spirit of the space and how you choose to relate to it as a member of the community or selfishly advertising as a concept is fine for example in places where there is a tacit agreement that we will tolerate it in magazines on tv before movies and other media etc i just dont want to have to walk down a city street that is more like a canyon of fucking advertising for private companies who agreed that every bus shelter should have an ad on each side who said we should allow building owners to put giant flashing ads on a marquee we dont get enough say in what shape our cities and public spaces take and i dont think its unreasonable especially for a socialist to demand that should be decided more democratically this should be part of the positive vision of a better society that we put forward
socialism,not_removed,some laws would be nice though of course you need some advertisement opening a back alley shop and hoping people will just stumble there is a bit starryeyed on the other hand ads today are appealing to emotions mostly unrelated to the product while one may chuckle at the promises of axelynx it gets utterly disconnected from reality when you hit perfume advertisments car ads come with freedom to turn your eyes from the fact that you will mostly need it to drive to your wage slavery spot of choice i also think this would be a good start for people who are generally discontent with the system but havent fully understood the situation yet an icebreaker so to speak if we need to appeal to peoples emotions to win them maybe turning advertisment against capitalism itself could work love me some adblocker
socialism,not_removed,its hard so why bother in every single instance it makes no sense to reduce the number or intensity of ads
socialism,not_removed,makes perfect sense when you consider they are distractions from the road i think theres a statistic of how long people look at adverts while driving i think an average of seconds while driving but fuck if i remember and im too busy to look it up for proof and considering a life could be lost in a splitsecond its a pretty important thing actually some countries have already banned advertisement on the side of the road and have reported less distraction amongst drivers some ads are even animated like a gif on the side of the road edit sorry im talking specifically ads that are viewable from cars driving in certain public spaces if not most including on the side of the road
socialism,not_removed,it illustrates how we were not involved in the decision to allow ads everywhere the decision was made undemocratically
socialism,not_removed,my university recently did a similar thing but rather than spikes on the doorways they paid to have the city bus stops around campus fitted with bars to prevent people from laying on the benches
socialism,not_removed,i hate this hostile architecture nonsense theres a store downtown where i live that plays extremely loud classical music on their sidewalks all night to try to keep homeless people away god forbid their storefront help the community by sheltering someone from the rain for a night but nah fuck building housing for the people we need a new luxury apartment block built with guaranteed tax breaks
socialism,not_removed,in the uk all bus shelters have weird tilted seats so you cant lie on them
socialism,not_removed,i dunno im a country person i like the country not that big a fan of cities i dont like looking up and not being able to see the sky above me because of big ass buildings in the way
socialism,not_removed,if the word consent automatically gives you pause you should do some self criticism when i said i didnt consent in this specific case i am illustrating that we are not as the public let in on decisions about what shape our common spaces take next time ill be more explicit for you but if you dont agree with the point thats fine just dont make semantic arguments instead of engaging in the discussion from a place of intellectual honesty
socialism,not_removed,so your fear is that a socialist revolution wont solve everything and that to assume that it will is oversimplification id say that is correct socialism or even communism is not sufficient to form a utopia some might say communism is a necessary component of one though
socialism,not_removed,capitalism requires you to profit from and compete with your fellow humans and socialism requires that you share and empathize with your fellow humans at this basic level we can see within the person why they are drawn to each system
socialism,not_removed,in short i am a little scared how well socialism could negate capitalism and how it could be an easy maybe lazy answer there is a very simple but hard hitting poem by brecht that answers your question its sensible anyone can understand it its easy youre not an exploiter so you can grasp it its a good thing for you find out more about it the stupid call it stupid and the squalid call it squalid it is against squalor and against stupidity the exploiters call it a crime but we know it is the end of crime it is not madness but the end of madness it is not the riddle but the solution it is the simple thing so hard to achieve remember that of todays society think that tina is true meaning that there is in fact no alternative to capitalism that it is the only way and the final form of human society that alone will make it very very hard to take even a few small steps towards socialism not to talk about a socialist revolution in our own lifetimes and thats only the ideological side of things i havent even talked about the power of the capitalist class the weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the ruling class in numerous nation states around the world their hundreds of millions of soldiers advanced conventional weapons their control of the media and on and on socialism being a relativly simple negation of capitalism doesnt tell you anything about the probability of achieving it i would also caution you that having a concept of socialism is not the same as actually understanding current capitalist society to do so you must understand the marxian critique of political economy you have to get a hold of the value form commodity fetishism exploitation expropriation of surplus value etc etc also read up on the state form thats where the power of capital is concentrated or could it be that the current world is just so fucked up that even turning a few wheels can have a huge effect for the better what does that mean if its an appeal to reformism you should forget about it and instead read by rosa luxemburg if you think that overthrowing the totality that is the capitalist system and society is just a matter of turning a few wheels reread what i wrote after the poem
socialism,not_removed,in short i am a little scared how well socialism could negate capitalism and how it could be an easy maybe lazy answer if the negation of capitalism socialism were easy then the world would be in a wholly different place than it is today given the events of
socialism,not_removed,gender race etc are all false consciousnesses of class because they are fundamentally viewed under some hegemonic lens which is conditioned to delineate difference in a hierarchical manner that doesnt mean there arent racist assholes who hate black people it just means that theyve missed the point and since they cant change being poor they can certainly imagine themselves as a part of something superior that they can conveniently see in the mirror every daypresumably between sessions of finger banging their daughter
socialism,not_removed,what if i just tend to make more then my fellow workers i do so by a legitimate means and i chose to heighten my personal standard of living and if thats not allowed then what sets my standard of living the collective what moral compass guides my life why dont i have the right to raise that standard of livingeven if i just have a bigger tv then all my neighbors or if i canto what extent can i raise my standard of living above my fellow man i just feel that socialism has no moral compass or base outside of the collective whicheveryone could have a different opinion and it all falls into choas im just trying to figure it out
socialism,not_removed,yes that is pretty close to what i was wondering about i think i am looking for concrete topics or the other way arround in what way would a socialist society be most likely troubled
socialism,not_removed,it looks like brechts poem lob des kommunismus is what i was asking for thank you for that socialism being a relativly simple negation of capitalism doesnt tell you anything about the probability of achieving it i would also caution you that having a concept of socialism is not the same as actually understanding current capitalist society to do so you must understand the marxian critique of political economy you have to get a hold of the value form commodity fetishism exploitation expropriation of surplus value etc etc also read up on the state form thats where the power of capital is concentrated and this is the next spot i suppose i have to get back to the kapital for this what does that mean if its an appeal to reformism you should forget about it and instead read reform or revolution by rosa luxemburg reform would just push us back years or so until it happens again so no i meant it more in a way that if you would apply reforms the effect would be easily measurable until shit hits the fan again of course so back to the poem somewhat in conclusion the idea is highly empathic and therefore for many that have been trained by the system to conceal and not feel for others even understandibly for their own survival for these it is hard to grasp
socialism,not_removed,if your that concerned about having small tvs then just make bigger tvs westerners freak out about a lowering of standard of living in a fledgling socialist society while in reality the standard of living for the oppressed will rise if your standard of living is lowered as a result of socialism then your previous lifestyle is unsustainable and was only sustained through exploitation if your are not morally ok with the raising of the oppresseds standard of living and the falling of yours then you are not ok with socialism
socialism,not_removed,i think the things that would most trouble a socialist society are the things that have troubled them in the past aggression from nonsocialist societies a tendency to get to the socialist phase and give up bourgeois capitalist infiltrators socialism is not easy the whole time it is hard at first but the struggleand it will be a struggle is worth it for a world better for all of humankind

socialism,not_removed,i think the article is pretty accurate but i would like to add that of the loss of manufacturing jobs have been to automation and technology and only to direct losses overseas the us manufacturing output goes up almost every year while the jobs keep going down when self driving trucks become common we will lose another million truck driving jobs
socialism,not_removed,daily reminder that your average western nation was at indexs for productivity in and now averaging indexes almost trebled productivity humans have never created as much widgets or services as they have now yet working longer hours with fewer benefits than they were almost fifty years ago produce more and get less of a life in return with no real safety net onward to glorious capitalism if we stay the path we can have the workhouses back for those unable to find even the precarious work that exists justcapitalismthings
socialism,not_removed,fair point just talking about automation for a second im all for it but i am highly skeptical of moving toward automation when we have done nothing to address the brutal economic system we all live under because all were going to do is push people into abject poverty so i am lukewarm in my happiness of our increased technology vis a vis our workforce
socialism,not_removed,this is an example of how capitalism is its own grave digger its ceaseless quest for ever greater profit leads to the conditions that cause its overthrow a lot of people are afraid of being called accelerationists when they say this automation globalization and the global division of labor are while not to the proletariats immediate material wellbeing progressive movements towards their global revolution
socialism,not_removed,increasing automation will inevitably increase class consciousness and allow for the material conditions for a true socialist revolution which marx foresaw way back in the i say this because revolutions up until this point have been from largely undeveloped nations trying to bypass capitalism which is why they often failedalong with the fact they were constantly undermined by the western capitalist nations my point being that automation is going to happen because it allows for capitalists to minimize costs and forces the working class out of the jobs they previously had this will lead to lower and lower purchasing power of the average worker and eventually major economic collapse of the likes we have not seen before liberals social democrats and other capitalists believe we can learn to cope with these things through government sponsored programs handouts a universal basic income and other ideas but they all fail to fix the economic system which allows for this great inequality to prosper and continue to get worse
socialism,not_removed,i do my best by buying local and supporting local craftsman union strong
socialism,not_removed,exactly this this is actually what marx means when he uttered the phrase from each according to his ability to each according to his needs in a higher phase of communist society after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor has vanished after labor has become not only a means of life but lifes prime want after the productive forces have also increased with the allaround development of the individual and all the springs of cooperative wealth flow more abundantly—only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners from each according to his ability to each according to his needs marx karl part i critique of the gotha program

socialism,not_removed,except the bureaucratization of unions has led to their development into capitalist institutions that do nothing to challenge the systems of exploitation they were originally a reaction to
socialism,not_removed,rshitliberalssay there is no equality between the slave and the slaveowner or the capitalist and the proletarian joining a union makes things better but it doesnt change that
socialism,not_removed,one big union httpwwwiwworg
socialism,not_removed,unions suck proud member of ufcw
socialism,not_removed,i agree with that my question then is the revolution didnt happen either so in a time when its hard enough to get people to embrace unionism which is still capitalism how do we get to the grand revolution that upends the whole system i want to rip the bandaid as much as everyone else but i dont know how we get there without unions or unionism even if it doesnt directly result in the communist revolution dont we still need to encourage unionism as the iterative process of democracy in the capitalist workplace
socialism,not_removed,if i join a union ill be fired
socialism,not_removed,or admit they are a shrewd capitalists last resort to retarding the inevitable progression of history
socialism,not_removed,whats wrong with saying that unions are reactionary institutions
socialism,not_removed,although thats true joining a union still enables some workplace defence against further exploitation from the bosses id say its a necessity to have a workplace union presence
socialism,not_removed,oh take a long walk off a short pier what the fuck is this anti union fucking talk on a fucking socialist forum no it doesnt fix the fucking system to join a union but organizing is literally literally the most important thing
socialism,not_removed,ive never wanted to punch a maoist before but i guess there is a first time for everything
socialism,not_removed,im in that union too its bad its affiliated union aflcio is wayyyy fucking worse tho lol
socialism,not_removed,short term unions are obviously a good way to improve working conditions and quality of life long term they seem to me to be a very useful tool for organizing workers together the cnt in spain is sure as hell not reactionary
socialism,not_removed,i dont think reactionary is really appropriate to describe the issues with unions as vehicles of revolutionary change theyre not reactionary unless were now just using reactionary to mean things i dont like unions serve as the mediators between worker and capital and allow some semblance of collective bargaining and direct action under the global capitalist mode of production so in essence unions serve a function in this epoch they do structirually offer workers an outlet for solidarity and power in numbers however theyre a product of the hierarchical power relations inherent to capital and serve no purpose outside of that paradigm i dont see encouraging union membership under capitalism to be reactionary but we must be aware of their limitations and understand that unions will inevitably become a relic of capitalism in a postcapital society
socialism,not_removed,its incorrect for starters
socialism,not_removed,i think you are confusing reactionary with reformist
socialism,not_removed,of course unions allow for better working conditions and i dont oppose them for that i oppose them for their class character and because they prop up the relationship that must be destroyed the union is not the only mode of organization and it is one that the proletariat must go beyond
socialism,not_removed,all unions are not created equal many unions are simply organs of class collaboration even more so in countries where class consciousness is low
socialism,not_removed,what you are organizing is more important than organizing in and of itself
socialism,not_removed,so you think being unionized equalizes the capitalistworker relationship
socialism,not_removed,i suppose they are useful for improving working conditions but i doubt that they hold revolutionary potential anymore australia has a huge trade union bureaucracy
socialism,not_removed,you are putting to much focus on the organizationform over its contents sweden has huge unions but they are all really bad and have a long history of betrayal and class collaborationism using an union that existed years ago is not a good argument
socialism,not_removed,i get what youre saying i can definitely say that the trade union bureaucracy that dominates australia is reactionary thats where my views on unions are influenced from although my comment was more directed at people here losing their minds over the comment instead of engaging with them
socialism,not_removed,could a union be a stepping stone to proletarian control of the means of production in this case the business they work in
socialism,not_removed,while i dont think that ukoreanchallengers comment was antiunion it does belittle the importance of unions unions are pretty much essential to anticapitalism we should never ignore or belittle their importance
socialism,not_removed,i dont think that means unions should be opposed or not supported
socialism,not_removed,unions are reactionary institutions theyre really not in the case of syndicalism theyre major agents in socialist revolution agitating unions and moving them further left to a platform of socialism is a very good idea
socialism,not_removed,reactionary in the sense that they give place to workers to organise they are a reaction to capitalist exploitation but theyre a useful tool for workers i understand the us unions have sold out workers on occasions but many people would be in worse positions without them ideally you need union leaders who are militant and left wing ideologically and understand the symptoms of capitalism and how to manoeuvre within its mechanisms they should have democratically elected leaders which are chosen by the workers themselves and they also offer the benefit of agitating within workplaces on a legal platform currently theres nothing stopping you being in a union and fighting against capitalism the two are needed in the current climate
socialism,not_removed,they are also the form that workers struggle objectively takes under capitalism you need to observe the role reformist bureaucracies play in unions versus how the members are compelled to use unions
socialism,not_removed,the bureaucratization of unions is reactionary i absolutely agree however the functions that unions as structures carry out is not i think one should be able to separate unions as potential tools for leveraging working class power to mitigate the hegemony of the capitalist class and the abduction of unions by the capitalist class to serve their own selfinterests its not a lost cause to try to reclaim unions as weapons for workers to deal with capitalism under the present state of things and moreover i think its important for unions to be front and center in the struggle against capital as it makes the struggle against capital centerfold in peoples lives unions are also concretized symbols of class antagonisms so really you have this twofold function of them acting as way for workers to leverage power against the capitalist class while also keeping the contradiction of class materially observable which fights the rightwing approach to class solidarity
socialism,not_removed,it could work to take over the means of production in that business but thats not socialism
socialism,not_removed,lo och unionen sanna avantgarde för revolutionen du borde ju också ha sett hur gott vilda strejker gick utan att ha fackets stöd facket är inte det viktigta massorna är det revolutionära innehållet är viktigare än organizationsformen
socialism,not_removed,the form of organization unions shouldnt be placed before their content many unions today especially those in europe and america are completely backwards towards anticapitalism example the aflcio supported the dakota access pipeline because it would give americans jobs unions in the core imperialist countries largely dont care about workers or the oppressed they care about building up a large bureaucracy for themselves and workers who already benefit from patriarchy settlercolonialism etc and before this gets construed as some antiunion shit im not antiunion but unions are not essential to anticapitalism theyre an essential legal body for workers in capitalism they only exist as a body to bargain with capitalists and managers and as such they are not equalizing the relationship between workers and bosses what this comic implies or essential in a postcapitalist world
socialism,not_removed,in the case of syndicalism theyre major agents in socialist revolution ideology does not change the way that unions function under capitalism
socialism,not_removed,the conclusion that i draw from the reformist bureaucracies and the opposing will of the members is that unions should be superseded by distinctly proletarian organizations which can only form under the conditions for revolution these organizations would act to abolish what traditional unions only manage
socialism,not_removed,im a little unclear why isnt it socialism sure its piecemeal and only applies for those workers but isnt it a start
socialism,not_removed,its not socialism but it is socialist
socialism,not_removed,i miss the unions from the
socialism,not_removed,has nothing to do with ideology but actual material functions you can move unions to socialism and plenty of movements have done it this is the same as the working class in general having the function of upholding capitalism due to holding reactionary beliefs but it being necessary to remove this class from this ideological haze in order to have a socialist revolution
socialism,not_removed,applies for those workers thats just private property reorganizing workalienated labor and commodity production will not build socialism the revolution doesnt start with selfexploitation
socialism,not_removed,no its not private property and work is not socialist and never will be
socialism,not_removed,has nothing to do with ideology but actual material functions what exactly is this supposed to mean historically speaking unions have been agents of mediation and amelioration not of revolution also the working class does not uphold capitalism due to holding reactionary beliefs the relation of the working class to capitalism is one of real conditions not ideology
socialism,not_removed,im sorry i must be truly ignorant but redistributing a business from bourgeois owners to its proletarian workers is selfexploitation seems to me redistributing and democratizing the profits of the business to its workers as opposed to its parasites would be at least some kind of step forward
socialism,not_removed,you dont consider the proletariat gaining control of the means of production for themselves to be socialist please explain this way of thinking if you can
socialism,not_removed,historically speaking unions have been agents of mediation and amelioration that entirely depends on what region youre looking at the aflcio or the cnt in catalonia the relation of the working class to capitalism is one of real conditions not ideology and what exactly does this mean do you use marxist analysis when examining capitalism do you know what a base and superstructure is the reason reactionary beliefs exist is because they prop up the capitalist mode of production beliefs which many members of the working class hold it is our duty to change this among that class my previous point was that unions can be agitated to a socialist platform which can attack the capitalist mop as they have in historical cases
socialism,not_removed,the point is to abolish the work and valueform not redistribute it coops have existed for a really really long time and they still havent built socialism just removing the bourgeois doesnt get rid of capitalism its just capitalism without the capitalists the alienation and the forcing of work would be the same redistributing and democratizing are just social democratic buzzwords they dont fix alienation and they dont give people the control over their lives communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established an ideal to which reality have to adjust itself we call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things the conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence karl marx the german ideology
socialism,not_removed,what is this mem no the workers at one workplace owning that workplace is not socialist its still private property its still work its still under the valueform it doesnt give the workers back the controls over their lives it changes nothing
socialism,not_removed,the aflcio or the cnt in catalonia held direct workers power and then gave it up in favor of the popular front
socialism,not_removed,do you use marxist analysis when examining capitalism do you know what a base and superstructure is the reason reactionary beliefs exist is because they prop up the capitalist mode of production beliefs which many members of the working class hold and then you immediately contradict this by suggesting that despite the economic base being the cause for widespread reactionary beliefs socialists can somehow change this by proliferating their own ideology that aside how can you justify the blatant idealism in this comment nonliberal beliefs which can attack the capitalist mop beliefs do not lead to attacking the capitalist mop revolutionary needs which emerge from the proper conditions lead to revolutionary actions
socialism,not_removed,httpslibcomorghistoryworkersagainstworkspanishrevolutionmichaelseidman the good part that everyone always ignores
socialism,not_removed,socialists can somehow change this by proliferating their own ideology so you expect to have a socialist revolution with workers holding sexist racist and reactionary views homophobes and reactionaries will compose revolutionary cadres revolutionary needs which emerge from the proper conditions youre dodging points through rhetoric how did catalonia have revolutionary unions how does the iww have a socialist platform
socialism,not_removed,unfortunately yes i think that it will take some time for the revolutionary mass to overcome their idealism the revolutionary process changes the material base seizing of productive forces allows for communist ideology to overtake reactionary ideology i certainly dont think that any more than a small number of them will be communists until the revolution has advanced far enough as to catalonia i do not know its history well enough to know the character of the unions involved the iww organizes outside of workplaces and has a relative degree of autonomy outside of the labor capital relationship it by no means represents the majority of unions

socialism,not_removed,mixed feelings he is essentially a new steve jobs but this time in space hes innovative and wants to reduce the impact humans have on environment and stop global warming pretty nice he also is the bane of libertarians since he relied on government support to advance his innovative technology which amuses me so much but either way he still is a capitalist who lives off of the surplus of others hes also quite the american exceptionalist and really could care less about the working class whether they are middle or lower class
