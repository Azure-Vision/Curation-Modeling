space,removed,what did i stutter are you one of those people who believe that paper that gives answer x and not the papers that give the answer y huh science isnt about consensus writing a paper isnt evidence of black holes existing of papers are absolutely disproven by one if those of papers have zero evidence and most papers published these days are twaddle sorry httpmotherboardvicecomblogscientistsarestrugglingtowadethroughthebullshitoffakeacademicpublications papers say that black holes exist facts without evidence is science fiction paper says they dont i knew it they dont exist nikola tesla was a genius you nerds and losers who worship silly theories from a retard like hawking hawking and einstein two jewish plagerists in a wheelchair should be sterilized and evidence hitler was right

space,removed,do you guys think theres a relation between space exploration and modern culture yes theres been one even before sputnik launched just read a bit about scifi genre especially literature and filmstv how do you see it as one of many topics that inspire culture while i would love to see more were already getting more and more spacethemed media so i cant really complain how you see its potential in the near future certainly as the space sector grows and it does quite rapidly well see media follow not just in coverage but in various spacethemed books films games comics etc do you think space exploration havewill have an important impact on our culture if yes how so depends on what you define as an important impact on our culture it inspires the whole genre science fiction that transcends various media recently in games weve seen a rebirth of longdead spacesim genre hard science fiction entered into the cinemas with martian gravity interstellar i was about to write about tv mini series red mars but comes out it was put on hold god damn it then there are new tv series like dark matter the expanse or more vaguely spacethemed falling skies defiance the occasional miniseries ascension all of which included some concepts developed discovered or studied for a real space exploration then there are all the events directly related to space exploration that become embedded in cultural consciousness such as the comet landing or pluto flyby but at the same time we have a growing problem with a growing antiscience movement in various forms be it antivaccination flat earth climate change deniers or whatever else growing influence of social media which leads to spreading lies as pseudoscientific truth ie food babe bob etc things that have an increasing impact on a nonmassmedia culture and essentially fighting against positive influences of space exploration or science in general then theres the fact that a large majority of people couldnt giver a rats ass about space in general with many of them considering it to be a meaningless expense if not an equivalent to burning money in front of the homeless and then theres the usual argument that we need to solve our problems down on earth before moving out

space,removed,well from what i know theres been talk of burying it at the site of the incident cape canaveral but it hasnt come to fruition i think its something similar to the situation with sunken ships in pearl harbor that contain the bodies of sailors these astronauts died in a testing incident and not an actual launch but they died for something greater i think its less of a whats the use in keeping it thing and more a question of whats the use in scrapping it wed stand to gain nothing we know what happened to them and our technology is a bit more advanced now scrapping it would seem disrespectful given that it would be difficult to crack it open and remove whats left of their corpses putting it on display is grim it might serve as a reminder of the dangers of space travel but it might scare off kids that dream of going to space i think right now our best option is keeping it in a secured warehouse which we do or as has been requestedpitched already lets bury it in florida where it happened that way the astronauts are laid to rest and the public at large doesnt go into shock when staring at what is essentially a sarcophagus
space,removed,well we probably think that aliens need those things because all six alien species weve made contact with need them so its just logical to assume the rest do too the franchope from tau ceti can withstand much greater ranges in temperature variations than the other five but other than that our survival needs are all roughly the same also fish do breath they use gills to get oxygen in short its like abraham lincoln once said dont ask nonsense questions on the internet while youre high fam

space,removed,check out the lunar retroreflectors httpsenmwikipediaorgwikilunarlaserrangingexperiment the most convincing proof id say is that the russians certainly would have exposed it if it had been faked a giant multi stage rocket did certainly launch if it had simply remained in orbit for days they would have known about it and heres an interesting perspective on how the film technology of that time was incapable of faking it
space,removed,needs a better frame job tbh
space,removed,carrying crew and cargo simultaneously isnt a bonus its a flaw which explains why payload costs with the shuttle were in the range whereas spacex brought them down to even before reusability which is on the level of the proton which is built from ordinary boilerplate steel

space,removed,no its not dont follow these loonies into the rabbit hole currently the earth is tilted at degrees from its orbital plane roughly halfway between its extreme values the tilt is in the decreasing phase of its cycle and will reach its minimum value around the year ce this trend by itself tends to make winters warmer and summers colder with an overall cooling trend leading to an ice age but the century instrumental temperature record shows a sudden rise in global temperatures and a concurring glacial melt has led some to attribute recent changes to greenhouse gas emissions

space,removed,in one experiment at watts of microwave power the authors measure thrust of micronewtons while all three data points for watts of microwave power have thrusts of less than micronewtons indeed the thrust at watts for all data overlaps pretty much perfectly for all data taken at watts they can only claim a slope by turning the power down to watts where they do consistently measure less thrust in other words you apparently cant get more than micronewtons of thrust out of this machine why the paper doesnt speculate on that question at all

space,removed,old news title contains false info you know what to do reddit downvote to hell
space,removed,latest reports being published show that the evidence is just not there which in a way is wonderful since updates to mond and other theories are cropping up the way science is supposed to happen even dark energy accelerated expansion has taken a recent hit
space,removed,misleading title rest in peace
space,removed,such words much lmao no bleach

space,removed,thought it was asphalt for a sec lol but awesome photo
space,removed,did you try a reverseimage search
space,removed,i know the frustration of seeing something and having people roll their eyes at you when i was around years old in the early i went to a tennis court with my brother which was usually vacant and started to play mostly goofing around and bored it was a clear blue sky beautiful summer day in the midwest my brother stops playing and points to the sky behind me there was a perfect white circle in the sky a seemingly white circle not very large you could hold up your fingernail and eclipse it it was shade of white and stood out like a sore thumb in the sky at a glimpse it could be a cloud but your senses immediately notice its too perfect and it wasnt drifting we looked at it for a minute and went back to playing maybe min later my brother said hey its moving i turned around again and it was indeed slowly moving straight up no audible sounds and the circle changing shape before our eyes and i know this sounds insane but it was crystal clear its shape started morphing into an upside horseshoe sort of shape httpiimgurcomeyekrxypng so it keeps going up until it fades out of view we run home to tell mom she dismissed us then days later the monday paper mom was reading mentioned the flood of phone calls to the police department about an object in the sky turns out my aunt who lived miles away also saw it we never got an explanation from any authority it was just one of those moments that faded away
space,removed,dont look up
space,removed,man its amazing how little i matter
space,removed,so many stars that i cant clearly say where betelgeuse star is
space,removed,woah what lens did you use
space,removed,
space,removed,saturn loves you
space,removed,do any people live on saturn
space,removed,thnks for the new wallpaper
space,removed,finally a good picture of me
space,removed,how come i never see that arrow when i look up in the sky
space,removed,since the sun is so far away is it dark on saturn
space,removed,httpimgurcomaocjim
space,removed,are they tapped out for our life span no so colonizing other planets is the idea for the specie to survive from where did you get that the best way to survive is to colonize something
space,removed,this photo is called the day the earth smiled leading up to this photo carolyn porco planetary scientist and leader of the cassini mission convinced nasa to allow her to turn the craft around and snap an image of our solar systems crown jewel saturn in it would be visible our home they recognised this as an opportunity likened to the pale blue dot as referred to by carl sagan and they publicised the time and date that this photo would be taken at the exact time the photo was taken people from around the world who were aware of this photo being taken looked up and smiled in unison
space,removed,p
space,removed,i died laughing
space,removed,jesus
space,removed,how does it look in relation to uranus
space,removed,sweet it looks like earf
space,removed,i love you to

space,removed,what is that pointy thing below earth
space,removed,everything we know all in a few pixels amazing
space,removed,wrong
space,removed,what the fuck are you talking about lol
space,removed,they say you can fit saturn into earth times over
space,removed,youre wrong small changes affect a species and over time they appear to be completely different because one population will be split by a natural event such as half of a species ending up on an island while the other half is on a different land mass now you have the same species in two places but over a million years the mechanisms of evolution will affect each differently ending with species that could no longer reproduce with each other
space,removed,ripple aerospace very cool thanks

space,removed,youre reading too far into my comment i meant that the specific engine on this rocket the doesnt emit srblike exhaust
space,removed,im sorry watch an atlas v launch tell me where you see smoke emitting from the in this video
space,removed,also i was specifically referring to the as in the liquid fueled engine on this rocket in the original photograph not the falcon
space,removed,is this a poster that can be bought somewhere
space,removed,yep i knew that
space,removed,i dont understand why were arguing because you decided to try to correct me based on semantics when it was clear what i meant i understand that the outputs something i get that youre right what i meant was that it doesnt output anything near the level that an srb does
space,removed,sweet i noticed youre a computer engineer where do you work

space,removed,can they determine mass of a planet from these distances or are future missions going to have to wing it if they try to land on one
space,removed,i think the sun has herpes
space,removed,its really depressing that hillary vs trump vs goauld makes the actual alien parasite from another planet a viable option
space,removed,lol
space,removed,please stop posting and communicating with the world at large we dont need your stupidity bleeding into others
space,removed,there is the possibility of doing so if our greatest minds are able to solve the relations between magnetism gravity and spacetime relativity in theory it possible to break away from all three of those to accelerate at exponential speeds that would surpass the speed of light because you wouldnt be traveling linearly across space an einstein–rosen bridge would be a great example of this
space,removed,absolutely the release of the kepler exoplanet discovers is also part of the plot trump and clinton aka kang and kodos will make a joint announcement immediately after the nomination processes have concluded
space,removed,the donald trump yuuuuuge telescopemake the aliens pay for it
space,removed,mars will be at its closest on the and thus have the largest apparent diameter but it will not be at its brightest this happens on the days earlier when it reaches opposition when it earth and the sun form a straight line you can see it already in the west after o clock or so its very bright and easy to spot cause of its orangered glow grab yourself a small telescope and youll be in for a nice show fun fact a mars opposition is always preceeded by a mars hohmann transfer window which is when the best time to launch spacecraft happens thats why you saw exomars launch two months ago
space,removed,finally mars will be close enoughtobring watney home neverforget
space,removed,that had to be amazing

space,removed,its a so no it is not pulled by a semi it is self propelled actually it is six spmts two side by side in the front and four in the back coupled in a two by two grid each spmt has two rows of six castors each with two dual wheels so two dual wheels per castor times twelve castors per spmt times six spmts gives us tires on the road assuming that each castor has a pair of dual wheels thats four tires per castor times twelve castors per spmt
space,removed,i think you may be a bit light in your count those are actually there are six spmts two side by side in the front and four in the back coupled in a two by two grid each spmt has two rows of six castors each with two dual wheels so assuming two dual wheels per castor times twelve castors per spmt times six spmts gives us tires on the road
space,removed,when you throw stuff out the back of the rocket motor in one direction the opposite reaction is what moves you you dont push on anything but yes this thrust it transmitted to the rest of the spacecraft by connecting the rocket engine to the rest of the vehicle

space,removed,looks like arse after its been violated passionately
space,removed,i suggest reading kuhn and feyerabend sometimes we have to rip up the map and that is quite painful as we become committed to them done that and it is cute and makes some good points regarding how sometimes the old guard really cannot make progress because they learned a differing set of boundaries but that is mostly true in a lot of fields anyway as progress is mostly done by the young and often by people with nontraditional educations who are not as weighted down with assumptions nevertheless the overall model is pretty garbage and if the em drive were to suddenly pass a bunch of convincing tests with flying colors i am sure most physicists would get right on board peoples willingness to get on board isnt actually the problem its their ability to make progress there are other maps that we have we have prescientific maps like math and logic meh and most of the good work on that is actually just a little over year old and is contemporaneous with science not pre scientific we have the map of intuition and a priori knowledge which good philosophers will tell you are not worth much we have competing religions competing folkpsychologies and even competing sciences hahahahahahaha as for this is an assertion from hell have you ever heard of philosophy or religion or mathematics or folkaccounts this is precisely the sort of hubris that deserves to be disturbed my degree is in philosophy with graduate work in symbolic logic and philosophy of science it is not hubris it is an unmitigated string of years of triumph versus nothing there is one way of looking at the world that has produced results even calling it science is just silly there is just what works and what does not and science is just a name we slap on a disconnected group of practices that leads us to what works of which folkaccounts and religion are not parts and mathematics and logic are just extremely base liminal cases of you either have science or you wallow in skepticism and the doubt of induction as a valid process for producing knowledge whatever the fuck that is if you do the later you have literally nothing

space,removed,icwydt
space,removed,cant make an omelette
space,removed,my only solace in this is simply that on a galactic scale humans just got here a few seconds ago we cant appreciate it yet but we will in time remembering the early pioneers like cernan the way we should the moon race was more about old cold war beef with russia than anything else and keep in mind while they were strapping people onto those rockets in the name of friendly competition they were busy bolting nuclear weapons to them too space exploration was an afterthought to the technological might that nasa helped the military achieve we have much to move past before being truly able to venture outward as a species
space,removed,ideally manned flight would have continued but its not like nasa hasnt been busy since getting some of the best imagery of our solar system ever taken this last year and this year to be sure their army or robotic explorers laying the groundwork for manned flights beyond our own planet and they are building a new heavy lift mars ready rocket for the next generation of human space flight my parents saw us land on the moon i think i will witness us land on mars
space,removed,i believe we will not only set foot on mars but actually colonize it in my lifetime men like cernan will be remembered as the wild west gunman of space the accomplishments of these great and brave men will never be in vain in galactic terms they are laying the bedrock upon which our species will take to the stars simply because we are somehow drawn to it

space,removed,theres enough sunlight to see despite being billions of kilometres from the sun at midday it would be about as bright as a heavily overcast day on earth plutos sky is almost all black except perhaps in a faint halo around the sun and a tinge of light blue along the horizon occasionally a rare plutonian cloud scurries past but very slowly plutos atmosphere is stagnant so there is very little wind at sunset it gets a lot more interesting the sky would suddenly turn a vivid light blue like and thats true colour no enhancing colour whatsoever if you looked along the horizon plutos haze layers would be night time is probably a little brighter than youd expect with the haze layers refracting dim sunlight all the way to the dark side of the planet if youre on the of pluto which new horizons didnt image very well charon would appear in the night sky it would look huge about the size of a fist held at arms length for comparison our moon is the size of a penny it would also be a constant companion since both pluto and charon are tidally locked to each other charon would appear to be completely motionless hovering in the sky day and night forever sunrise is even more dramatic you get all the cool blueness of sunset and such but since fresh ice that has condensed over the weeklong night time is now exposed to sunlight it evaporates away forming gigantic at the surface long sunbeams would be cast it would look amazing
space,removed,astronomers would use this as well best viewing is done on moonless nights

space,removed,the green mile
space,removed,io is the most volcanically active body in our solar system because the moon is deformed on a regular basis as it passes between the path of jupiters other moons and the planet itself the process is known as tidal heating simply put the planet is stretched apart and the resulting friction creates an immense amount of heat the surface can be disturbed as much as from normal every time it makes a pass between the outer moons orbits which can occur about every earth days

space,removed,tasa i like the sound of that our rockets will be bigger and better than yours and the rockets will be powered purely on bbq sauce and all the in flight meals will be whataburger fuck yeah
space,removed,yeah b is super important their macroeconomic targets are inflation and unemployment they employ monetary policy to try to get us there they also do stuff like market interventions with monetary policy say what you will bernanke prevented a second great depression by his decisions and he did so going against congress if we elect a moron into office the executive branch wont be able to fuck up how the fed is run directly which is largely by a bunch of macroeconomics phds we should be tankful for that
space,removed,cool i actually have some questions from looking at it that no one has answered please help why isnt there a constant sonic boom around the equator as it is travelling way over the speed of sound i get that we cant feel the rotation but why cant people feel the massive acceleration when fly down to the equator from the higher latitudes why havent the constellations changes for thousands of years when our galaxy has been hurtling through space faster than a speeding bullet all of that time and why do star trails form perfect circular trails around the pole star in long exposures when the thousand mile an hour motion is dwarfed by the speed of our sun around the galactic plane etc not trying to be a dick am troubled by this
space,removed,he just copied the first results off of google thats not how
space,removed,conservative tx lets do science reddit moonbats let us bigots play politics
space,removed,beepbeep im a bot your comment seems sad to us cheer up have a ps this bot is powered by ai
space,removed,gotta wonder how this lie got started just because the death cult stole from people they murdered in the lands they invaded doesnt mean they were standardbearers of anything other than unfettered brutality your standardbearers of western civilization have already murdered or enslaved millions of europeans and spread genocide and terror and do so everywhere they are able to this very day
space,removed,no the photographer meant his camera was triggered by the phallus shape of the rocket and its representation of the patriarchy
space,removed,ah okay just wanted to make sure i hadnt misunderstood something space is very interesting to me but im not in the field nowhere close so i want to make sure i understand correctly to avoid spreading misinformation
space,removed,so previous post says its yards away now this post says its around yards away op is a dirty liar dont ruin your dads camera they cost money

space,removed,i wrote a story as a response to a writing prompt on this topic its fiction maybe we saw them first from tranquilitys cupola as we passed over the eastern seaboard the fiery booster trails of hundreds of ballistic missiles first a massive volley from the east rising fast into the sky in tight clusters followed within a few minutes by replies from submarines off the coast of norway as we reached midatlantic and then behind our orbit hundreds more from the west the mirv bursts from london berlin and paris hidden under weather were like oldfashioned flash bulbs popping and then dissipating with a fizzle the clouds roiling and bubbling we watched in awful silence the window filters boosting to direct sunlight settings with each new detonation we moved across asia watching the warheads explode like popcorn across the surface of europe and then the station slipped into night across the pacific for minutes of darkness the silence and twilight was punctuated by repeated swearing then slowly the crew drifted guiltily into eastern and western teams each retreating to their own home modules and mother languages gort the commander gathered the westerners into a midair huddle gene get somebody on comm he said marco status on rations and water and get me a schedule jones get ready to lock the door at unity im going to open the safe move it without waiting for answers he bounced towards his sleep berth as the rest of the team pushed off to workstations closing the door to his vertical cabin gort removed a small neckchain from beneath his shirt and snapped the plastic dogtag in half extracting a tiny code card he punched the code into the lockbox embedded in the bulkhead beside his light fixture the door popped and he removed two cards and a hard acrylic chip from the safe in his head he already knew the procedure more chapters

space,removed,and their soviet counterpart httpsenwikipediaorgwikisolidoxygenredoxygen
space,removed,nasas purpose is not to entertain the public but to do science the pictures are nice though and help with raising public awareness
space,removed,by frame of reference i mean that everything in the universe is always moving but you have to measure velocity relative to something for example earth is circling the sun several kilometers per second but we dont feel that so if youre driving a car you measure its velocity relative to the surface of earth because that makes the most sense there is gravity everywhere actually juno is moving at a slightly curved path because the sun is pulling it expansion of the universe is not a concern in this case as it affects the movement of galaxy clusters relative to each otherat very long timescales
space,removed,hi this is juno sorry i missed your call please leave your name and number and ill get back to you as soon as i can
space,removed,im really not sure if youre serious what is scientism universal applicability of scientific method heres what scientism means in my context debunkingskepticscomscientismphp but van allen belts are absolutely passable as long as you dont stay in them for weeks apollo flights passed them in just hours show me an official release from apollo project that states that otherwise ill consider that you pull it out of your ass how long can you stay in a microwave without being hurt nasa works at a shoestring budget but is capable of developing new technologies for spaceflight and airplanes observing earth and other planets for science thatll help with climate science geology and countless other things and is also helping private aerospace companies to pursue their goals to make space more accessible blah blah your groundbased gps and satellite tv would work rather well on a flat earth but not on a round one i see whatcha did there when reason cant apply you bring your new toy that scientism just developed recently the tinfoil arguments were not funny anymore so they brought the flat earth psyop so they can discredit everyone that questions nasa calling them flat earthers totally lame
space,removed,so whats the motivation of a powerful rocket is a quick acceleration the most efficient thing for leaving earths gravity
space,removed,released in april if anybodys interested
space,removed,juno juno i know youre screening my calls juno hey nasa guess youre not here probably should have tried the office ah dang well looking forward to the gala
space,removed,can you imagine being at nasa and hearing that beep and losing your fucking mind because this is an extremely cool journey and we have finally made it and then finding out it was todd the intern cooking a burrito in the microwave
space,removed,greatest american juno eh i hope nasa gave it the manual
space,removed,ju sound like juno what youre talking about
space,removed,
space,removed,im glad you called but im not home but ill be back before too long you gotta wait for the beep you gotta leave your name you gotta leave your number wait for the beep beep
space,removed,nasa whats your reaction to seeing jupiter up close juno f nasa sorry all we heard was a second beep can you repeat
space,removed,it took nine months
space,removed,nihilism
space,removed,thank god hillarys going to be president huh could you imagine one of those other imbeciles with their finger on the button
space,removed,the first picture they published that was of a place in the sky no bigger than a grain of sand held at arms lengththat one picture that came out about years ago or so showed thousands and thousands of galaxies just in that one tiny place alone and after seeing that picture i no longer believed in god
space,removed,it is almost ironic that while astronomers often find exoplanets hundreds of lightyears away in other star systems theres probably one hiding in our own backyard dr mustill said stars are born in clusters and often pass by one another it is during these encounters that a star can steal one or more planets in orbit around another star this is probably what happened when the sun captured planet nine
space,removed,ive always looked at space as violently beautiful
space,removed,i downvoted face in thumbnail was way too creepnerdy not smartnerdy like animedollwife nerdy getting a strong josh duggar vibe

space,removed,thats messed up theres a difference between looking inbredpedo and having a legit disability plus i dont really trust dudes who are so wrapped up on visiting some other planet when theres still tons of shit going on with our own planet seems like they have something to hide

space,removed,im pretty sure percent are trolling
space,removed,does mars usually not have clouds

space,removed,what brought that on i actually cant tell what youre arguing for here its like youre not even commenting on what you quoted
space,removed,well when something is a minority in a field it gets attention thats just the way things are its only belittling because thats your personal perception but for everyone else its a celebration of an achievement
space,removed,this is clearly fake and we are being lied to the earth is a cube people come on

space,removed,i do not give consent for you to show uranus to anyone thats just nasty
space,removed,usually eat a lot of blue popsicles
space,removed,risky click of the day
space,removed,well just have to ram through uranus
space,removed,holy shit thats a nice telescope how much is it ballpark million dollars fuck do you take food stamps
space,removed,low hanging fruit here op colonoscopy there i said it seriously though uranus is one of my favorite planets due to its tilted axis
space,removed,make sure theyre your own kids though
space,removed,poetic license i think no one knew exactly what was at the center so imaginations ran wild it was the and americans were obsessed with landing on things it would have been too disappointing to have a planet where you couldnt plant a flag but hey dont these gas giants have we could land on afaik the film was recently rereleased in magnificent bluray and the fulllength versions on youtube have vanished
space,removed,almost didnt buy one but then at the end i saw they provide free bubble wrap and packing peanuts so i pulled the trigger
space,removed,optcorp has a special though
space,removed,well could we get something cheaper i mean shes not a mafia bride and now that i look at it its not really to to skyless tastes yknow
space,removed,gotta shut down the gofundme page
space,removed,ok but do you take those food stamps
space,removed,can confirm proctologist sees this during checkups however refers to it as scope through uranus unsure as to why
space,removed,came here for the funny uranus comments and was kinda disappointed
space,removed,this post is made for you its about sunshine upon uranus
space,removed,i see its clean shaven seriously which telescope is that pic from the typical portable telescope would only show uranus as a speck
space,removed,careful with your efforts to expand ruranus you dont want too many dicks showing up
space,removed,freezing yourself or asphyxiation would probably also achieve the same effect
space,removed,here comes the comment complaining about the comments complaining about the misleading title
space,removed,thats not what my anus looks like through a telescope

space,removed,i see a speck of dust care to elaborate
space,removed,an angled trajectory do you mean the httpwwwspacexcomsitesspacexfilesitlstreakjpg of an orbital launch vehicle the curved path is to get into orbit not to escape the atmosphere youve got to go up only about miles but youve got to get to mph while going parallel to the earths surface which is the tougher part check out to the edge of space by going straight up vs spacexs return from space on an orbital launch blue origin went straight up because it wasnt carrying a load into orbit spacex obviously took the curved path because it needed to get into orbit
space,removed,so youre telling me i actually might be able to avoid years of trump by going to mars
space,removed,some quark of existing laws sorry couldnt not mention the albeit cheap pun here
space,removed,theres no way to know what you cannot know its very easy to fit new theories on top of older theories because our theories are incomplete but we dont know if they are complete or complete or complete so if you have another of stuff to do then your theory is ridiculously worthless except on earth and the particular applications where it works
space,removed,has anyone actually read the theoretical original paper i couldnt find any flaws with the paper like my hypothesis is it interacts with the quantum fabric of the universe
space,removed,im sorry but its hard to get excited about this whole interstellar travel dealie when we have more pressing issues her on earth have you heard about these muslim terrorists that are taking over our country we need to fight for our white culture and heritage and diverting funding from this newfangled space engine and into interment camps for these scoundrels is the only thing that makes sense to a guy like me trumppence and go tarheels
space,removed,earths crust is thick on average
space,removed,you go into great detail about delta v and keyboard alt codes but you just expect us to know about periapsis and apoapisis

space,removed,in unrelated news trump will be president soon
space,removed,fuck off you stalker dick
space,removed,its basically like a crappy fm radio signal where you can barely hear the music over the noise the music in this case is obviously the data and when measuring really small sensitive things that music is really quiet compared to the background noise to have a significant result you want your music or the data to be much higher in values than the noise floor which is the base level of noise that is essentially impossible to get rid of this is called the signal to noise ratio and you want that to be as high as possible if it is barely over signal divided by noise then you are barely skirting the noise floor

space,removed,thing is if you find microbes you need to be sure they didnt just hitch a ride from earth your sterilization process needs to be perfect at every stage to prevent contamination from earth life it would be terrible to go all that way only to be asked if we could spare tree fiddy
space,removed,this kills the microscopic life we went to look for in the first place
space,removed,why so long though
space,removed,galaxy solar system
space,removed,one article i read earlier said that it was kept a secret while they worked to verify the signal
space,removed,she dumb
space,removed,i cannot imagine what that level of euphoria feels like
space,removed,yes please
space,removed,stop it
space,removed,get out of here get out
space,removed,science fiction
space,removed,actually suggesting that we start suggesting another planets oceans before weve even begun to scratch the surface of our own is pretty childish youre the typical neil de grasse nasa fanboy hur dur space is gonna save us without actually thinking about what might be best for humanity right now and in the near future you just want to live vicariously through an astronaut or a drone sorry but no ones going to live in space in this generation or the next
space,removed,whats the timeline on this i want to know the probability of being dead before it happens
space,removed,youre god damned right
space,removed,this is fucking sweet
space,removed,enhance
space,removed,hah
space,removed,solar panels would only get of the sunlight theyd get near earth mirrors or lenses would useful since theyre probably cheaper than adding more solar panels
space,removed,in other words
space,removed,its my movie ben
space,removed,tell me about it
space,removed,zombie lives matter
space,removed,irobot the manufacturers of the roomba does have experience with cave exploration and military applications so their expertise isnt out of the question former irobot military division httpendeavorroboticscom httpsenwikipediaorgwikipackbot the nrl has been doing lots of research into uuvs darpa even made a public video game to crowdsource tactics httparchivedarpamilactuv and cave exploration with autonomous drones is a very real thing already so combining those things into a extremely durable and reliable submarine seems to be obtainable but itll be difficult i think that nasa should focus on making a reusable exploration platform lots of gliders with sensors could map and explore for a much lower cost before sending any autonomous submarines
space,removed,too fucking true
space,removed,and now im going to have nightmares again worth it
space,removed,
space,removed,its not a manned mission
space,removed,im suddenly less excited
space,removed,wow its like i didnt see this hours ago
space,removed,thats not only cool as hell but also scary as fuck the sheer force of gravity in the black hole is unimaginable
space,removed,first of all im a reaganloving conservative so dont try to play the partisan game have you ever heard of vietnamization look it up he destroyed thousands of acres of vietnamese farmland and killed thousands of south vietnamese if you think that turning our enemies into an economic powerhouse was a good thing then theres no hope for you we completely abandoned our allies the roc for no apparent reason other than nixon selling them out for a new market for goods which backfired anyway when they took all of our manufacturing jobs and if you think the epa did its job well have a glass of tap water from flint michigan
space,removed,love me some

space,removed,what good is the mission if the cockpit blows up at the launchpad
space,removed,kinda crazy thought republicans were against abortion
space,removed,no apparently space time sort of explains it but wish it would delve into more details
space,removed,black holes are anomalies with intense gravity that sucks in everything else around it with that gravitational pull the event horizon is the final resting point before you would be ripped in the tiny shreds this is the string theory where all matter is strung in to millions of particles this simulation in my opinion was a little off because yes matter does bend from the gravitational pull yet you wouldnt be able to live that long to see it happen however i believe the inside of a black hole is completely white on the inside because all of that matter being torn apart in to its simplistic form white light would build up inside the black hole black holes for what we know care still so strange we cant tell if it bends time and space all we know is it is extremely powerful and god damned terrifying
space,removed,ops article title misquotes source cnbc article headline after talking with trump bill gates say presidentelect could be like jfk

space,removed,videos in this thread videocomment and some are very massive yeah but gravity is stronger the closer you are to the center of mass think of it like this its sorta like all the gravity also gets condensed into a smaller space and since even small black holes have a ridiculous amount of mass and you can g this video by pbs space time is a great explanation of why that is a common misconception highly recommend this channel heres a video of an elite pilot crashing into a black hole basically you drop out of supercruise and hang there unlike a star you wont burn up and explodedie im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch ill keep this updated as long as i can httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get me on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit

space,removed,rip alice
space,removed,ahh to be robed in eternal darkness
space,removed,regrettably yes but it is you know a sacrifice required for the future of the human race i hasten to add that since each man will be required to do prodigious service along these lines the women will have to be selected for their sexual characteristics which will have to be of a highly stimulating nature
space,removed,so are we talking about a wall of nonetime that you can crash into but never pass since its solid or more of nonejello that you slowly sink into as every part of you becomes slower at the order in which youre headed and much older than the other end of your body untill you stretch into infinity particle by particle

space,removed,thats a good read thanks
space,removed,this is absolutely and utterly impossible but it turns out itll be okay for reasons youll see in a second due to the lovecraftian curvature of spacetime within the event horizon all the trajectories that would carry you away from the black hole now point into the past
space,removed,spacegine
space,removed,shit dude is that some shitpost simulator sign me the fuck up actually i just cant be arsed to play games that arent minute matches in league of legends ¯ツ¯
space,removed,this is of course the gravity of the black hole doesnt kill you

space,removed,no you are completely mistaken
space,removed,no problem
space,removed,wasnt there some scientist or something that said there was some planet that we couldnt see or find or something like that and that some ancient somerian spelling artwork or text showed that planet along our solar system but iirc many debunked it saying they werent planets but just random drawings or something
space,removed,i think hope you mean landing
space,removed,
space,removed,nice
space,removed,haha classic person
space,removed,thanks
space,removed,cool front page i made this print along with a lot of other science and spaced themed stuff you can find here if you really want the apollo print you can pm me if i get enough requests ill make another run of it
space,removed,awesome
space,removed,so
space,removed,go away dad

space,removed,use the vagina
space,removed,heading to chicago sometime in the new year and was super excited to learn this just now however when i tried to look them up i kept finding articles about how the place closed in
space,removed,yep still wearing that get your ass to mars shirt
space,removed,i thought you were just another lousy troll since your comment history is a mixture of citation needed fuck off learn to read and a consistent bitching about strawmen red herrings despite most of your comment history being one big list of fallacies i was beginning to wonder if you were capable of an intellectual thought im sorry i doubted you here is uwallawallaangeleyes wasted intellectual potential summarized in women should have the right to vote no they should not i can give you three very good reasons women should not have the right to vote first it allows politicians to drive a wedge between men and women pitting husband and wife against one another they can use gender identity politics to attempt to appeal to men or women exclusively pitting half of the nation against the other half while giving them an out on addressing the real issues it gives politicians in washington the power to get between a husband and a wife emotionally and intellectually which is outrageous and should not be allowed second it is the most destructive thing to the family before feminism only men had the right to vote and almost all men got married in practice this meant that there was as a trend one vote per family not one vote per person if we assume the lowest possible trust in politicians then we assume that their political rhetoric will always reflect the bare minimum of what they can get away with when over of american voters were men casting votes for their families politicians had no choice but to pitch policies and laws that were conducive to family values but when all adults have a vote politicians no longer have to care about family values the level of discourse can be lowered to simply being individual friendly instead of being family friendly we can see the transformation this has on political rhetoric in action by simply looking at how talking points were changed homosexual marriage is bad for the family stopped working as an issue why because of the individualfriendly rebuttal what people do with their own bodies–or what they do behind closed doors–is no business of yours the family gave way as an issue to the individual this counter to antihomosexual sentiment did not exist until women were given the right to vote
space,removed,thats frustratingly lowres anyone have a high res version
space,removed,wait does mike pence believe in space didnt the devil put satellites up there to bolster the insidious lie of climate change
space,removed,this is awesome a lot of pences voters think the universe was made in days by a bearded old man
space,removed,well donald has lost my vote space was put by god to distract man from his faith the bible is very clear on this matter that when the almighty smited the tower of babylon he did not intend for man to live at high altitudes i thought i could let the trump tower slide but this is just unacceptable and i truly worry about the fate of this country
space,removed,will this be removed because the wrong person supports it
space,removed,is he wearing the get your ass to mars shirt
space,removed,it was compressed times basically time is the original upload and time my wallpaper version if i get a lossless image from great person uidocaffeine who remade the whole thing in vector style ill redo mine and upload it through lossless hosting site if anyone cares
space,removed,pictured total ignorance of the presidential race the fbi thing changed the probable outcome from clinton electoral landslide to solid clinton win
space,removed,trump doesnt believe in climate change and he thinks vaccines cause autism his vp thinks the earth is years old and evolution isnt real not thinking hes gunna be helpful for science
space,removed,rip speakers
space,removed,so you do but you dont like minimalism im confused
space,removed,this dude does not believe in evolution
space,removed,maybe on a ten speed
space,removed,you sir are a genius
space,removed,space bartender sounds like some futuristic song title
space,removed,beautiful
space,removed,total bs the kepler mission supposedly measures blips of darkness against stars there is no way it can show detail and composition of said blip just another fairytale to support a waste of time government project
space,removed,if they thought we were interesting theyd have visited by now this is called the fermi paradox which has the following solutions aliens dont want to interfere and all have a sort of prime directive not to touch us until we have sufficient knowledge and tech this is known as the zoo hypothesis were the only species that have advanced far enough yet and all other aliens are somewhere between singlecelled organisms and chimpanzees in complexity or life at all is just extremely rare in the universe intelligent species have nuclear warsetc and annihilate themselves so all intelligent aliens are dead and we will be soon
space,removed,math is hard lol
space,removed,it saddens me to live in a major metropolitan area with visual magnitude below i never see much more than three planets and maybe a couple hundred stars
space,removed,just a note that sun spots arent actually black they just appear that way when you take into consideration how bright the surrounding area is
space,removed,he looks like a boy standing there a sense of wonder
space,removed,sauron is that you
space,removed,where is this cave

space,removed,i was gonna post that haha so youre probably all set
space,removed,that would be a single system

space,removed,i tried this
space,removed,im not cool with people owning black holes that could swallow the earth
space,removed,i agreebut competition leads to faster innovation
space,removed,directions unclear i now have an infinitely massive orange
space,removed,i agreebut corruption leads to faster innovation
space,removed,
space,removed,yeah but if the chinese put a spy in their capital you risk losing yours
space,removed,on the other hand if the chinese had to abide by the us safety ethics and recordkeeping standards theyd still be launching firecrackers
space,removed,i agree but the apocalypse leads to faster innovation
space,removed,it was more than once
space,removed,dont know if a really big mountain or just a closeup
space,removed,can confirm
space,removed,
space,removed,some of us are stoked because its science were looking at an image that was taken from a rover that got sent into space to another planet which sends us pictures that it crops together for us some of them are stoked because conspiracy theories some of us are stoked because its helping develop fundamental knowledge about the biogeochemical biologygeologychemistry structures that make up the surface of mars if the processes were the same on mars as they are on earth we can basically understand the paleoenvironment ancient environment
space,removed,and all we got was this lousy tshirt
space,removed,ok that was pretty great
space,removed,im going to torrent no mans sky dont spend bucks on it it got bad reviews
space,removed,what if this is an actual literal photograph of god that would be nuts
space,removed,space is big really big you just wont believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is
space,removed,so humangis beeg
space,removed,absolutely beautiful
space,removed,pls dont downvote me for this but god does exist even though this pic is cgi
space,removed,omg link pls
space,removed,i read this in donald trumps voice
space,removed,astronomers hate her
space,removed,religious fanatics hate this one weird trick
space,removed,the closest galaxy is million light years away that means even if we find a way to travel at the speed of light which i suspect is theoretically impossible it would take a long fucking time were in the golden age of space exploration in a broad sense space travel for the average person is probably never going to be a thing until we need to leave earth in order to survive
space,removed,ive been thinking about this and it finally makes sense you cant warp travel you cant warp out to the pillars of creation to see them destroyed and then warp back to earth to see them intact once youve seen them destroyed theyre always destroyed for you you can fly there really fast if you have a powerful enough ship you can do it in minutes even a fast ship is like pressing the fast forward button youll see the pillars get destroyed while youre in flight but you can never unfastforward when you fly back to earth the pillars will still be destroyed and everyone you knew will be dead
space,removed,is there any proof that the earth is some spinning ball pfft i doubt it
space,removed,im not rambling and youre a frothing at the mouth ducking fanboy jesus christ relax boy d
space,removed,i wish i could pull off half of this stuff in kerbal space program
space,removed,i would give gold if i could can i pay with cash
space,removed,nothing new looky look here httpsyoutubejjspujhhagq
space,removed,that sure is a lot of space junk out there somewhere
space,removed,what a cool picture looks like its from a sci fi movie
space,removed,this is amazing
space,removed,why the random old link on a climatedenial blog op
space,removed,its only like a mile or two to the pad isnt it
space,removed,really nice comments here more concerned with internet points than the op is what kind of trauma did you suffer that this affects you so deeply
space,removed,first the is delayed now starliner faces further slips great job guys
space,removed,lol sorry
space,removed,rspacedicks
space,removed,in other news things with similar ingredients can smell the same
space,removed,yes
space,removed,so on a scale to donald trump to scrooge mcduck how rich are you now
space,removed,its sad that we havent sent any single lander there yet i wish space agencies could stop with mars and focus more on places we have not actually explored yet
space,removed,ever heard of composite images will you shit you pants and try to hang yourself when you will see this composite
space,removed,that kills the photographer
space,removed,rip iceantarctica on a different note climate change is an urgent threat that needs immediate action climate change is like a broken leg the longer you wait to give it treatment the worse it will become but when you give it treatment keep in mind that it will take long to heal explanation broken legclimate change longer you wait to give it treatment the worse it will become longer you wait to treat climate change the worse it will become but when you give it treatment keep in mind that it will take long to heal earth is the slowest computer it needs time to update as soon as i looked up hilary clintons thoughts on climate change i thought shes in it for the long run and id be glad to have a president that thinks about humanity as a whole phew that being said i hope a gave a good explanation of climate change though not defining it but rather comparing it to something
space,removed,in scientific terms pluto is known to be really fucking cold and due to its small size its planetary core is really fucking cold due to all this fucking coldness water is frozen
space,removed,what does pleasuring a woman with three of your fingers have to do with this
space,removed,interstellar accurate sure the space science though hypothetical was somewhat accurate but a sudden blight on literally every crop that whips up out of nowhere just to tell humanity to fuck off awful
space,removed,i hate frogs theyre just gross and seeing one giggling around in microgravity like that is just disgusting
space,removed,what are the wires for
space,removed,including potatoes sigh they just had to reference the martian

space,removed,but no flatearthers are totally rightthe earth is flat and space travel is a hoax i dont get how they retain their beliefs after seeing the natural curve of the earth in any picture from any plane let alone seeing a fucking rocket reaching the upper atmosphere above the curvature of the earth in the same picture maybe i misunderstand their beliefs though i dunnoflatly denying solid evidence is not my cup of tea at any rate

space,removed,interesting hypothesis i dont see why it wouldnt although id imagine nasa has already thought of this and theres probably some reason why it wouldnt work whether it doesnt simulate actual gravity property or maybe theres an engineering issue im assuming they didnt go this route for a reason
space,removed,if i said the first few times would that make more sense to you i honestly dont see the problem
space,removed,hoping someone can help me with the physics here on earth in a vehicle when it moves forward im pushed forward with it ie i sink into the car seat a little but in space assuming the station is movingnot sure if he just floats there and nothing touches him why doesnt the station just move past him
space,removed,ohok that makes sense now so if the station did accelerate then it would fly past him im assuming
space,removed,cool thanks thats a lot of laptops for a small room
space,removed,if my memory is still good before newton postulated the theory of gravitational waves dragging objects towards the centre of their nearest mass big enough to generate them einstein believed that if you remove the frame of reference from the objects there would be no way to determine that they were accelerating because they remain stationary in space relative to one another so he came to the conclusion that they simply werent and that removing air resistance from the equation meant that the objects werent falling down in this context rather that the earth was instead moving up to meet them he later said this was the happiest thought in his life
space,removed,yeah everybody lets upvote negligent levels of pollution polar bears are dying but its okay we got white people going to space to play around
space,removed,generally you need a phd level education from a toptier college and have to excel in a field that nasa uses for the scientifictechnical route for the pilot route you generally also need a high level education masters and extensive pilot or testpilot experience almost always obtained through the military for either route need an iq of or higher nasa has a great many thousands of applicants every year but only a handful or less get selected

space,removed,yeah ive always wondered about the same thing with the dust the only explanation the one which is always given is that particles behave very differently when theres no atmosphere and low gravity that could explain why the landing legs are so clean it may be that the dust particles has such a high velocity due to lack of air resistance that they never really touched the landing legs why there arent larger booster marks i cant explain fully but i have a theory looking at the landing footage from inside the capsule it appears to be some dust being blown away but its not that much it could be that although the moon is dusty theres not several meters of dust on top of a more compact surface scientists were afraid this might be the case and that the landers would simply bury themselves but it luckily didnt turn out to be the case one thing to remember when looking at or trying to understand the photos from the moon is that although the laws of physics applies everywhere the moon is in fact not the earth apart from those who have actually been on the moon its very hard for us to try to understand a world where the gravity isnt what were used to and where theres no atmosphere thats what were used to and anything that contradicts it seems instinctively strange to us even though were consciously aware of the fact that it isnt earth were looking at

space,removed,you should have additional concerns visavis the rise of extreme right wing nationalist governments in europe given further legitimacy by trumps victory and a collapse of the eu and nato giving way to russian aggression
space,removed,three points first while i think the hitler comparison is a bit off i can totally imagine how he got elected things were really really bad for germany and he provided a passionate voice with a convenient scapegoat second i think a lot of why trump got was elected was based on voter lethargy you had two lackluster candidates fake news muddying the water and an entertaining candidate who said did and promised a lot of things i find deplorable and yet the real issue seems to be the low voter turnout rate from what i have read the republicans turned out in much greater numbers than democrats i cannot blame that on people being stupid just disconnected lethargic possibly a bit ignorant and manipulated ultimately though i agree this is perhaps his most potentially damaging legacy i think overall humanity is getting better overall despite more exposure to things i would argue we seem to be more tolerant of each other and more cognizant of how this planet cannot tolerate us abusing it at least not without screwing up the biosphere as we know it and can exist in it healthfully more than that i just read how americans highly value alternative and renewable sources of energy trumps recent actions done in the name of creating jobs very temporary ones at that blissfully ignores the will of the people the silver lining if i were pressed to find one is that we are one election away from changing all of this it just takes us to collectively care more than we did in november and go to the polls en masse figure out how to make that happen and things may change much more radically than most would think possible cheers

space,removed,people reading about trump in years will not believe how such a man ever got elected as president of the formerly most influential country on this planet im an american and i cant believe how such a man ever got elected
space,removed,google search bar trump quotes denying climate change about results seconds
space,removed,honestly this is my second gripe my first gripe is war caused by his words and actions especially war fought inside the usa
space,removed,as far as you can tell obama never claimed that climate change was a chinese hoax obama isnt an idiot driven by greed and attempt at drawing a false equivalency between these two is absolutely laughable obama absolutely took climate change more seriously than trump is right now this isnt a binary argument where obama is disqualified just because he wasnt a major proponent of nuclear energy thats some seriously narrow minded logic
space,removed,trump thinks we are in a cooling trend and that this global warming thing is an elaborate hoax some random quotes on the subject from his twitter over the years they changed the name from global warming to climate change after the term global warming just wasnt working it was too cold this very expensive global warming bullshit has got to stop our planet is freezing record low tempsand our gw scientists are stuck in iceits freezing outside where the hell is global warming its snowing freezing in nyc what the hell ever happened to global warming we should be focused on magnificently clean and healthy air and not distracted by the expensive hoax that is global warming obama said in his sotu that global warming is a fact sure about as factual as if you like your healthcare you can keep it for those that constantly say that global warming is now climate change—they changed the name the name global warming wasnt working

space,removed,the more trump denies it the more work gets done on it i fail to see the problem
space,removed,i agree with most of the things trump says and think he can make some good changes but his stance on climate change is just idiotic climate change is my highest priority when deciding what candidate to support the reason he got elected was because of the party system where each side just spews out bullshit and lies to further their own party and themselves and not the people wish we could get an independent president with some common sense
space,removed,business lobbyist kickbacks are the reason the gop doesnt care its all about money let some future generation clean it up as long as they get their money

space,removed,as a european this is my one and only big concern about trump you should have one more hes threatened nuclear war
space,removed,first of all im not defending trump hes a billionaire foreign president to me who is capitalism incarnate to my point both the media and trump lie a fuckton about the pettiest things media lied about the inauguration as well the pics youve probably seen were taken after he spoke as seen on the clocktower even visible on peoples watches when you zoom in on the super hd photos its pathetic lies all around on both sides which is why i hate it so much when people pretend the media is a victim while trump is a bully countless examples of blatant agenda pushing from both sides with no regard to the truth also source on the orgs he tried to muzzle
space,removed,he has denied for years that the earth is warming some twitter posts of his over the years with many more i didnt put herr this very expensive global warming bullshit has got to stop our planet is freezing record low tempsand our gw scientists are stuck in ice they changed the name from global warming to climate change after the term global warming just wasnt working it was too coldits snowing freezing in nyc what the hell ever happened to global warmingits freezing outside where the hell is global warming for those that constantly say that global warming is now climate change—they changed the name the name global warming wasnt workingobama said in his sotu that global warming is a fact sure about as factual as if you like your healthcare you can keep it we should be focused on magnificently clean and healthy air and not distracted by the expensive hoax that is global warming

space,removed,to put it simply the usa has undergone a corporate coup detat in slow motion and its over weve lost and theyve won so you have swaths of disenfranchised people not represented by either partythus the last us general election was very much antiestablishment themedand the dems ran the most est candidate there was trump was viewed as an outsider to est politics thus his successdespite he himself being a large beneficiary of the policies est politicans in the past put in place how this is rationalized as trump is antiest is another debate

space,removed,climate change by definition is undeniably real question is how much is humanity contributing to it obviously pota is now in big oils pocket and i suppose big business in general unless your business is space travel so its only wise to assume that since the biggest argument for humancaused damage to the earths climate involves oil and coal and oil and coal are now bffs with pota the new admin will fight tooth and nail against any allegations stating that we are doing anything to encourage the change of the earths climate rip nasa youll be hitchhiking on falcon and soyuz rockets for the next years it looks like well miss you dearly
space,removed,this just in trump is mentally retarded i dont mean hes stupid i mean he has actual problems with his brain

space,removed,okay but that should go both ways polluting businesses have the same incentives to discredit climate change only moreso because not only do they want to preserve their jobs but they also want to preserve their profits it is in their narrowly defined interests to lie as much as possible and get politicians on board by yelling about how climate change is a hoax designed to kill jobs or something and while youre right that scientists do have career incentives not to question basic assumptions they also use a rigorous process of peer review politicians can say anything they want but scientists have to back their conclusions with data repeatedly publishing all their methods and stating their assumptions its a lot harder to bullshit when you have to pass peer review after all peers are incentivized to be skeptical of other scientists right

space,removed,its not an unanswered questions natural climate change happens over geological timescales we had a near °c increase in temperature in the last century and the warming corresponds neatly to the increase of in our atmosphere under parts per million before the industrial revolution to about ppm today there are no other scientific models that can explain global warming as well as the anthropogenic greenhouse effect and even if we somehow werent responsible for the warming our emissions are still fucking up the oceans by making them more acidic which is an often omitted but still tremendously important part of climate change

space,removed,you can be born in another country and be naturalized as a us citizen look at arnold schwarzenegger the issue that trump was saying is that the constitution explicitly requires you to be a natural born citizen which has been held to be either born in the us or to us parents depending on which side of the debate you fall it gets iffy when only one parent is a us citizen then it goes by how many consecutive years theyve lived in the us since a certain age we have never elected a president that was not born on us soil though so it has never actually been an issue the biggest issue with that is that there wasnt much debate for other candidates that happened to be white since there is actually no legal definition of a natural born citizen youd think that there would be uproar about any candidate born outside the us there was very little debate about mccain in he was born in panama and that was openly known and even then the only debate was academically whether or not parentage counted or just birthplace and very little about cruz this last year born in canada both of those candidates to us citizen parents no huge cry for birth certificates from them obamas mother was a us citizen so even if he were born in kenya he would be a natural born citizen just like if mccain or cruz would have won but since he was black there was an enormous outcry that he was not eligible if he werent born here it was entirely racially motivated because so many people did not want a black president hell ive had members of my own family say that he couldnt be president because that nigger isnt an american i dont care where he was born that still exists to this day
space,removed,this is part of the reason i like our mandatory voting system sure if you want to be a complete wank you scribble cunt on your ballot paper and not vote but its still a lot better than a nonmandatory system also removes the worry of voters being suppressed and other shitty things you can do when voting is optional its not perfect but i think the australian system is better than the american one

space,removed,whoever reaches the other one first is likely to be more advanced and more dangerous regardless of how long it takes our inability to survive a long trip does not mean an alien life form is equally unable to do so space faring species may have definite advantages in this regard and why not come to earth its a very interesting planet full of all sorts of life forms some more useful than others some you may want to get rid of altogether to facilitate farming the rest
space,removed,where is the banana
space,removed,this makes me feel really weird
space,removed,its not that big actually its maybe what miles in circumference not big at all you can see craters from earth on the moon with your naked eye that are much larger than this tiny little guy
space,removed,more likely earth itself
space,removed,hershey to buy mars you heard it here first
space,removed,thats not a picture nasa only releases composites
space,removed,but its not easy to make measurements this precise so its a bit uncertain how offcenter we are and we do seem to bob slightly up and down but apparently not by much

space,removed,i would imagine radiation in messier would be yuge
space,removed,who rich adventurers like musk and besos and branson and others with a vision various corporations willing to risk money for the potential rewards of an entire planet devoid of government or regulation governments eager to sink their legislative teeth into said unregulated planet what no idea it will take new technology to enable food production on another planet water collection and recycling oxygen security there are no such things as the forestry and oceanic resources we take for granted on earth so you cannot live off of nature you need to create everything out of nuclear or solar energy projects like earth ii didnt work out so well even on our own planet so doing something similar on mars will be an enormous challenge
space,removed,its not size as much as weightand despite the its worth it lulz comments this cost a lot and is not a responsible use of money when money is so scarce for everything including space exploration
space,removed,its likely i was reading that nasas current budget only allows it to plan for a mars landing in years but spacex definitely wants to be there much sooner since they are a business they dont depend on congress for money they depend on company profits and on investors which can be either good or bad greater potential but less security or guarantee than with state funding i consider it good news that at least two different organizations with different financing models are in the race
space,removed,i for one welcome our new ape overlordskent brockman
space,removed,you are still paying for the lift so it does costso fill that space with needed supplies rather than a joke
space,removed,from this we get per pound finding out the weight was tricky from this i got pounds so it cost roughly dollars assuming a cost of dollars per pound
space,removed,there is always something useful you could add if you have empty space its responsible to use it for something essential not a joke if you can add a gorilla suit you could add essentials instead whether they are needed right then or not store them in the space you stored the joke in

space,removed,isnt a black hole just another planet or whatever but it only has abnormal gravity for its size and light cant escape i mean it sounds less spectacular if you say it like that rather than saying its a hole in the spacetime fabric and it leads to another dimension
space,removed,holy crap remind me to never move to a star near a blackhole even if its for a job with a better match
space,removed,why not giving the contract to spacex

space,removed,any of these opinion pieces from arstechnica are from eric berger it is one guy writing about his confusion regarding how nasa and congress work remember congress is the senate and the house both are republican controlled the house with a bigger majority both the senate and the house have their own separate space agendas more often at odds with each other than agreement confusion can occur if the reader does not know the difference between congress senate and house the house is several times more science illiterate than the senate since the republicans are the antiscience party and almost all the teapublican fundamentalists are in the house it is stupid but they want to manipulate nasa goals to fail the republicans dont like nasa and there has already been comments from some here that the us constitution doesnt include a nasa budget could it be that nasa wasnt around in the us president is under the executive branch the congress is under the legislative branch it is not the job of congress to make executive decisions but over the past decades they have muscled their way in to create as much confusion as they can the republicans are the obstruction party never forget that

space,removed,something decent finally
space,removed,right because strawman is trump and im a hero for opposing an insane strawman but why tf would he do that you fake news alarmist
space,removed,what constitutes cold in cape canaveral
space,removed,a more accurate analogy would be would you learn more about europe by spending a year in rome or several years sitting on different sidewalks in europe most probes to other worlds are stationary science platforms which usually just passively collect data although some can also do things like pick up surface samples to analyze more thoroughly an area km across and roughly circular would be thousands of times more area than has been covered by the opportunity rover the most successful and furthest roaming rover anyone has ever landed anywhere which has just recently traced a snaking path over long picking at the rocks is rolls by at about a half centimeter per second also you can encircle a surprisingly diverse variety of terrain and surface features on mars inside a km diameter circle after all youd be looking at a piece of land square kilometers in area
space,removed,can we not make this sub political please this is pathetic trump specifically wants to shift climate science away from nasa so they can focus on space exploration

space,removed,yes its the farright that is going after elon musk i think it is the laura ingraham types specifically here is an article about a group that has launched that is attacking elon musk and his companies
space,removed,that trump thinks the sky will break no i admit it you caught me i dont really believe that
space,removed,thanks spacex
space,removed,and its not because of nasa
space,removed,evil obama
space,removed,and i would argue that genetic engineering and eugenics also dont serve the same purpose which is why i chose that analogy you wouldnt use the words terrific or awesome to describe hitler but technically they are apt selections by their broader definitions despite much narrower common definitions if someone talks about eugenics theyre not usually talking about the selective breeding of rapeseed to develop canola theyre talking about galtonian eugenics a system of widespread selective breeding humans predominantly accomplished by limiting the birthrates of unfit people if you are genetically altering a person to eliminate specific deleterious alleles you are not selectively breeding humans a follower of galtons eugenic movement believed in preventing working class people from breeding because they were genetically inferior there is absolutely intent there which is why i chose murder rather than manslaughter for my analogy heres a history of the term if youre curious
space,removed,
space,removed,theyre not isolated comments the narrative that climate change is a significant factor in terrorism has permeated the left and obamas administration they never talk about ideology leading to terrorism but they will talk about the carbon we emit thats delusional i accept the science on climate change with whatever caveats may exist but im still critical about the claims being made and whether or not they are scientific its rather amazing that were supposed to empathize with our enemies as hillary clinton put it but we cant engage in critical analysis as to how our own citizens believe what they do when youre able to demonize our enemies as fervently as you demonize our own maybe a productive conversation can be had
space,removed,that was the biggest issue this election there is legitimate conflict between conservative and progressive values but its so hard to have a serious discussion when nobody can even agree on a solid baseline of facts the left was somewhat guilty of it but it was absolutely insane to watch the right spout off lie after lie as long as it pandered to the demographics they were trying to pull if someone has to resort to completely untrue facts to support their ideology either theyre selfish lazy or something is wrong with their ideology ive tried to have a lot of conversations with people with conservative values and when they are knowledgeable and researched about their opinion its an interesting discussion about what they want from the government and what they think it can achieve those were few and far between and almost none of them were voting for trump
space,removed,norad fucking tracks santa claus if you think they have trouble tracking anything larger than a chinese microwave then youre goddamn delusional
space,removed,i thought trump supporters were eager to tell us that it doesnt matter what he has stated hes gonna do completely different shit as president than what he said in the campaigns frankly i dont know what the fark to expect at this point
space,removed,i think it was the chinese that wanted to build their own space station but from what i understand their program is far from being able to do that safely space x has bought blueprints from nasa in using an that could either attach to the iss or be apart of their own station apparently its already in use
space,removed,to expand on what has already been said the push for civil rights greatly altered the political landscape the south used to be controlled by the democrats and they repeatedly blocked civil rights from passing lyndon b johnson was a large proponent of this effort when jfk was assassinated lbj pushed hard for civil rights to pass so he could secure the next election this created a lot of fallout with his fellow southern democrats whom chose to flip parties and support goldwater in the election lbj was very aware that his party had lost the south for decades because of this so you are correct in connecting bigotry with the republican party in the southern states but not the party as a whole after all the strongest support for civil rights came from the republican party
space,removed,while musk does rely on subsidies in part thats true of any company operating in the spacesolar business whos not also involved in weapons contracts you cant cut off musk without decapitating alternate fuel sources in near future demonising musk just to ensure trump doesnt sound like an idiot for pushing coal seems to be the order of the day
space,removed,quick someone craft an insult that combines trumps small penis size with decreased nasa funding theres still hope boys
space,removed,the point upolynomialpusher was making was is that as usual trump has made a lot of empty rhetoric about nasa without outlining any actual way hell implement his policies right now only the dems have said where they want the funding to go the repubs are silent about trumps deep space exploration plans
space,removed,i think that the concern is well founded when the big long term champions of this cause have been people like ted cruz if you compare what nasa has requested for the past few years to what they actually gotten youll see that congress is already draining funds away from the earth science parts of the budget to manned spaceflightthe sls that money hasnt been going to noaa so up until now and i dont see any reason to think that theyll start doing it later
space,removed,how to trigger flat earth believers
space,removed,during this time freshmen from different colleges watch the whole thing on their computers and continue to watch the horrors unfold over the years play this song years later society is actually better off in many ways in regards to health and crime however the world is still very orwellian authoritarian those guilty of thought crimes become guinea pigs and sent to live in experimental space colony slums elon receives reports of large numbers of robots being destroyed and some areas are being liberated elon brands this as a terrorist and wants them dead or alive whatever is destroying these robots are ruthless and effective whomever lays eyes on it never live to talk about it years earlier college students unaware of each other from different collegesstanford uc berkeley mit cal tech and carnegie mellon worked with their engineering schools to develop mobile power armor suits after years of development the students graduate and deploy they fly to different parts of the world starting in small cities destroying smaller robots finding weaknesses in their ai and gaining exp they run into each other at random times at first bumping heads for getting in each others ways or thinking another works for elon but they realize theyre all on the same side and team up along the way they confront elons most powerful and ruthless generals including steve balmer and larry ellison play this song after defeating all the generals they decide they have leveled up with enough exp and finally make it to elon musks castle at the very top floor they find elon musk in his rd lab in his most powerful suit they have a fierce showdown that eventually ends up in the sky and then in space he is significantly more powerful than any of the suits but the of them working together damage elon enough to beat him after elon is defeated he wakes up turns out elon musk was being controlled by a sorcerer from the future using gravity waves they realize the sorcerer then takes control of sergey brin and larry page to continue his plans elon musk joins the team they realize if they beat sergey and larry the sorcerer will just control another person the team decide to use gravity waves to go to the future to confront this sorcerer once and for all elon enlists the help of his top scientist emmett lathrop doc brown to build a time machine the future is post apocalyptic turns out the sorcerer is steve jobs he didnt die he just went to the future to see how it turned out he saw the horrors starting from that eventually led to the destruction of the worlds societies jobs concluded that humanity is inherently self destructive and the only way to save it is to rule it and then he used his apple technologies to hack elon musks mind the heroes try to fight him but steve is too powerful they manage to escape they figure out the only one who can defeat steve jobs is the person who defeated him before bill gates they travel back to the present and recruit bill gates to join the party they then travel back to the future and bill gates tries to defeat him but steve jobs has gotten too powerful from training in the hypersonic time chamber and bill gates has become too weak from running a charity instead of a ruthless business this isnt the anymore bill but bill gates is like batman he always thinks ahead he reveals he brought steve woz and he knows of all of steve jobs weaknesses steve jobs tries to rerecruit him but steve woz is too smart this time under steve wozs guidance the team is winning but in a last ditch effort steve jobs starts to compress all time and space into a singularity then this music starts playing the heroes travel the void and eventually find each other they find steve jobs again theres a reason why steve jobs did this in the singularity he was able to find the mindcontrolled sergey brin and larry page and fuse with them and from the forbidden merger of google and apple out emerges a new horrific god like creature this song starts playing now our heroes arent just battling for their present time or future theyre fighting to save all time and space they put a valiant effort and they fought until they had nothing left but it was enough to weaken the creature which then splits into steve sergey and larry they walk over to steve unconscious body but he then wakes up he immediately severely damages one of the power suits steve is still able to fight though severely weakened but at that point the team is so weak they no longer can fight it looks hopeless then out of the singularity steve jobs biological dad appears this song starts playing he reflects on jobs adoptions and talks how even though humanity makes mistakes it means well and that it doesnt need saving from itself but needs saving from a few individuals bent on controlling it even for altruistic purposes he then tells steve jobs to look into the future how the world would turn out under his rule steve does and discovered it is suffering a similar apocalyptic fate even under his rule with tears in his eyes steve now realizes the truth steve has to release the singularity but in order to do so he must sacrifice himself before he does so he talks to elon then he heads into the void releasing all time and space from the singularity he sends all of them to the time right before elon makes the announcement but only elon has memories of the events the whole taking over the world never happened and gates woz and the students never end up being freedom fighters and have no recollection of the events that transpired everything seems peaceful but from steves words elon knows if things continue the way they are the peace wont last but that humanity doesnt need saving from itself but needs saving from a few individuals bent on controlling it even for altruistic purposes elon knows exactly what he needs to do elon finds thrillary trump fused with hillary and does this to it elon looks towards the sunrise he knows that the future isnt secure but hes very optimistic elon knows that he is the only one in the world who can recall how he saved the world but it doesnt matter he has to get to work and focus on his new mission getting humanity to outer space when the earth inevitability becomes inhabitable the end or is it play this song but elon wasnt the only one who knew about the events that transpired in this passage in an office on the other side of silicon valley mark zuckerburg watches the whole thing on an occulus rift designed to view alternative realities he feels that steve jobs had the right idea but was too self delusional to properly control the world he knew that it needs to be done through temptation not force and thats why steve jobs society resulted in another dystopia

space,removed,from what i gather reddit is mostly liberals who are all very upset about the election so instead of trying to bring people together they continue the divisive rhetoric the second part is that everyone one who posts is an inherent expert on the subject that being said they automagically know that trump is going to destroy america based solely on campaign rhetoric and pandering either that or they have time machines
space,removed,highly controversial and a candidate nearly no one using this site voted for and despises
space,removed,im more impressed that he tweets
space,removed,because we are talking about shitty events of and i think trump was king shit of them all
space,removed,yikes
space,removed,wake up sheeple the government wants us to think that the earth is a globe so that we can spend trillions of dollars on the socalled space program space doesnt even exist the sun isnt millions of miles away its only a few miles in the sky same thing with the moon it was easy to land on the moon because its barely above the sky and only the size of a large building bush did chem trails are poisoning our citizens there are mind control substances in the water dont succumb to the world narrative and pseudo science ted cruz for president until he dies in office
space,removed,i mean i agree with everything youre saying but i was responding to someone who claimed that nearly no one using this site voted for trump i personally disapprove of a trump presidency but i also disapprove of closing your eyes to your surroundings and shutting out your peers as if they dont exist because they disagree with you politically
space,removed,ugh can we get out of doing low earth orbit research already this is all such a waste of time and money how do we not have a base on the moon by now it just infuriates me that greedy scientists think their little pet projects that they lobby governments to fund get budgeted instead of the real goal multiplanet humans
space,removed,so a mourge filled with his previous victims youre a brave one
space,removed,translated into english december from the baikonur cosmodrome was the launch of soyuzu with the transport cargo vehicle thc «progress up to seconds of flight of the launch vehicle took place normally after seconds of flight telemetry data reception ended established controls are not recorded on the functioning of the ships estimated orbit according to preliminary information as a result of the loss contingency tgc occurred at an altitude of about kilometers above the rugged uninhabited mountainous territory of the republic of tyva and most of the fragments were burned in the dense layers of the atmosphere the state commission analyzes the current emergency the loss of the cargo ship will not affect the normal operation of the iss systems and waste station crew

space,removed,god forbid something happen to the moon man
space,removed,god dammit youre not taking this one
space,removed,the group accused of bigotry i think that accused is an important word in this context maybe a lot of them are bigots but i think that aggressive ridicule without proper discussion only alienated these people more from any discussions that hinted at antitrump vibes and only strengthened their resolve to vote for him
space,removed,the fuel will literally freeze
space,removed,cant we just trade trump for buzz
space,removed,httpsimgsxkcdcomcomicstenthousandpng
space,removed,dont you fucking dare
space,removed,pussy
space,removed,right reddits mad that trump won fucking cool virtue signalling is the last fucking thing im trying to hear about
space,removed,you really think whining about how much is gonna suck because trump was elected is relevant in a fucking thread about buzz aldrin being evacuated from fucking antartica
space,removed,lmao theyre not gonna be good friends putins cult of personality may continue in obedient russia no matter what until his death but lets not pretend wanting to open some relations is anything but if trump really was that weak and god too cuddly the consequences could be catastrophic as russia continues to undermine democracy all over the world
space,removed,except literally none of that is true and repeating what news anchors tell you whos companies have a vested interest in trump not being elected is a terrible company to listen to
space,removed,you jinxed it
space,removed,dont you fucking dare
space,removed,well hes shit outta luck its
space,removed,oh theyre extremely consequential many of them were complacent they thought trump winning was simply impossible and they didnt like clinton so they thought theyd stay home and let clinton win without their help so they could have a clear conscience about it then the unthinkable happened and now a lot of those people are in the streets politics doesnt begin or end on election day if you want to understand what trump means you have to bear this larger context in mind
space,removed,
space,removed,btw correction to my post the third stage that failed in this flight is the optional fregat upper stage for the soyuz rocket its apparently only used for commercial payloads inc progress craft not for manned flights that could explain its lower reliability by being designed with less strict tolerances since its not used for manned missions
space,removed,hes pushing and looks like he could still beat me up
space,removed,please stop
space,removed,that is not what i said
space,removed,his only bad response from a year ago saying hey i like nasa but maybe we should put the money somewhere else changed to a much more in depth opinion that he seemed to keep backing that you can see for yourself i think hes going to try his best to be a good president nobody wants to be the person who ruins a nation so yeah im an optimist but i would be the same way if hillary was president too if he fucks up hardcore you bet id be one of those protesting but until then ill trust the man to do a good job

space,removed,she didnt discover dark matter dark matter was first theorized by kapteyn before rubin was even born and many scientists worked toward the theory while she was still a child she uncovered the discrepancy between the predicted angular motion of galaxies and the observed motion wikipedia while this certainly contributed to the theory of dark matter her observations provided indirect evidence for the existence of dark matter but not proof or discovery of it
space,removed,youre all over posts now and by the way i dont think they can remove that ladys fat im not doctor tho hello
space,removed,thats my understanding as well but i didnt want to go that far because im far from an expert in the field
space,removed,well both sides have asat weapons so if you miss the cold war its still somewhat like a mutually assured destruction in space cant wait to see manking httpsenwikipediaorgwikikesslersyndrome for a couple of hundred years
space,removed,years after kapteyn but about years before rubins contribution to the theory dont take this wrong reading this ladys accomplishments is truly awe inspiring the title is just misleading
space,removed,she wasnt even close to the first her evidence was at the time the strongest evidence up to that point
space,removed,could you give a laymans explanation of what dark matter is also how is is considered just as real as normal matter if it has never been directly observed

space,removed,from the god particle it was richard feynman in fact who suggested that all physicists put a sign up in their offices or homes to remind them of how much we dont know the sign would say simply this one hundred thirtyseven is the inverse of something called the finestructure constant this number is related to the probability that an electron will emit or absorb a photon the finestructure constant also answers to the name alpha and it can be arrived at by taking the square of the charge of the electron divided by the speed of light times plancks constant what all that verbiage means is that this one number contains the crux of electromagnetism the electron relativity the velocity of light and quantum theory plancks constant it would be less unsettling if the relationship between all these important concepts turned out to be one or three or maybe a multiple of pi but the most remarkable thing about this remarkable number is that it is dimensionfree the speed of light is about kilometers per second abraham lincoln was feet inches tall most numbers come with dimensions but it turns out that when you combine the quantities that make up alpha all the units cancel one hundred thirtyseven comes by itself it shows up naked all over the place this means that scientists on mars or on the fourteenth planet of the star sirius using whatever godawful units they have for charge speed and their version of plancks constant will also get it is a pure number

space,removed,gotta love corrupt senators
space,removed,somehow i have a feeling a democratic politician would be less likely to oppose spacex just because they represent a competitors district
space,removed,the average republican isnt really interested in things like facts and objectivity
space,removed,under faa regulations launch providers handle investigations when there is no loss of life injury or outside property damage im sorry if you didnt read the articles but its not my fault you didnt know that spacex is legally entitled to lead here its just that the investigation team still comprises over half of the team
space,removed,its nice not getting murdered but bottom line is nothing happens either way
space,removed,american maybe
space,removed,le
space,removed,example
space,removed,and they should be able to say no but that no might come at a loss of their most major business partner do you think apple retains the right expects to be able to look at foxconns lines especially if their was a major fuck up

space,removed,why do republicans hate science
space,removed,
space,removed,republicans
space,removed,i came here to ask is this real concern or a blatant money grab
space,removed,dude you are getting fucking schooled in this thread give up
space,removed,cbprivatescom my brother fucked absolutly all tits herein wanna be next
space,removed,would ultimately be a terrible thing for ula too ula has already had launches for the government launch explosions and government bodies driving the investigation in the case of the titan more launches are for the dod and hence teh air force space command did the convening this would just be standard practice
space,removed,there fucking ula lockheed martin mother fuckers sabotaged this rocket and now they are pushing for a congressman or a senator or who ever the fuck it was who they donated over to to try and make it so spacex has more oversight from an outside company maybe they fired a laser at the helium tank to explode the rocket and now they are trying to get congress to let them inspect spacex technology so they can steal shit or sabotage something else smells like fucking shit in here
space,removed,great shot
space,removed,you forgot the s
space,removed,
space,removed,it baffles me how someone can be stupid enough to think that saying they disagree with something is enough to prove anything
space,removed,spalling damage to the pad itself magnitude of which is yet to be released or determined i have yet to see a cogent argument as to why the air force doesnt have a vested interest in the outcome and depth of the investigation yet these facilities are the crown jewel of the us air force you can also bet that they have an extremely vested interest in having the vehicles that travel out of and back into their airspace are safe two upper stage failures originating from the same system is going to take some looking into and i dont blame anyone for wanting the more oversight into their processes that explosion literally rocked the entire space coast whether it did slight or moderate damage is not relevant to the political implications
space,removed,i think they went north
space,removed,scientists in antarctica till use our same time system despite it having nothing to do with local solar conditions they pick a time zone and work based on it blast you beat me to it
space,removed,in worlds where people will have to live inside domes or underground i think that they will just adopt an artificial hours cycle and use gmt or whatever time zone they deem fit on the other hand worlds that are terraformable like mars will have to adopt local time systems once people start to live on the surface though in the case of mars thats pretty easy as others mentioned itt

space,removed,nasa continually cuts corners in its projects by diverting funds to promote islam instead of fully making use of its vast resources to their various projects administrator charles bolden speaking with aljazeera the head of nasa explained that the mission of the space agency would now include outreach to muslims when i became the nasa administrator charged me with three things one he wanted me to help reinspire children to want to get into science and math he wanted me to expand our international relationships and third and perhaps foremost he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the muslim world and engage much more with dominantly muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science math and engineering if you forgot the provision of the national aeronautics and space act that grants authority to nasa to make muslims feel good about medieval contributions to astronomy thats because it doesnt exist but dont worry obama has been on the job because that seems like a pretty simplisticpotentially rude assumption your condescending attitude makes me happy the obama administration planning on cutting funding to nasa next year not only will this encourage free market expansion maybe youll climb down from your ivory tower and learn to show some fucking humility towards people who arent engineers or science oriented

space,removed,this implies that it was hot to begin with by what mechanism would it ever have generated heat they use that idea for earth the hadean eon bombardment by the matter that makes up earth fissionable materials decaying when you say it fast it sounds plausible but when you analyze it theres not enough energy if the moon started as some sort of accretion disk around earth as a result of a collision then you dont have enough energy if you say it started as a blob of molten earth from a collision then it wouldnt have an orbit it would fly out but then it would fall back as all energy would be radial and in order to achieve orbit it requires a force perpendicular to the gravitational field the moon is most likely a planetoid that at one time orbited the sun and was captured in earths growing gravitational well it has always been cold but it is gravitational locked with earth now that means that when it orbited the sun it was orbitally locked in the same manner so it had a period of rotation of one year to be orbitally locked with the earth it now has a rotation period of days so the moon would have had to increase its angular momentum this means that it had to flex and grind internally creating heat if you examine the moon there is very little water on the side facing earth at one time that side faced the sun and any icewater that fell into the moons gravitational well could not exist on the side facing the sun and as a result condensed on the back side of the moon so the water we find is on the back side to earth now also the front side facing earth is smooth no big mountains this is the result of how orbits decay on the moon there are mass cons on the front face of the moon they cause any orbiting body to have a greater and greater elliptical orbit where the perigee is aligned with the mass cons so when the orbit has become elliptical enough the orbiting body hits any obstructions mountains that are in its path these mass cons are also responsible for the orbital locking so the side of the moon we see is smooth and the side facing away from us has huge mountains on it since the moon only started to move away from earth as a result of tidal forces when liquid water appeared on earth prior to that its orbit would have started to become more and more elliptical because of the mass cons this implies that water on earth either came in an event or was always here as a solid if it was a solid it says the idea of hadean eon is a fail tectonic plates could have moved to cause the line we see but that would have been billions of years ago there have been too may collisions on the front side of the moon for any such marks to be so distinct there may not have been any atmosphere but theres still a lot of debris falling in and it always lands on the face of the moon

space,removed,according to they used a hasselblad camera and shot on film thats imax quality which brings us to as kodak makes imax film out of the same inkmaterial that they make film to scale you can argue that imax reaches a theoretical equivalent of digital or megapixels in real application even an expert we talked to within imax doubted if the viewer can see projected estimating that might be a more accurate guess so i guess the answer to your question is

space,removed,keep in mind that gravity also takes mass into account earth is much heavier than mercury is so the force of gravity is affected due to this
space,removed,the great space programs come from white nations i know saying good things about white people is taboo but facts are facts the world is still running on the fumes of germanys program from the as the ethnic cleansing of whites in america continues one of the consequences is the loss of things like a selfsufficient space program you cant have a nation flooded with infinite nonwhite immigrants and a first world space program besides what does bolden care about space exploration he stated quite clearly that the priority of nasa under obama is outreach to the genocide cult of islam
space,removed,i was more referring to the equation of gravity in general not for this specific instance and when you do take into account the eccentricities of their orbits and their semimajor axes you find that the orbit of mercury is around a quarter of the time it takes the earth to orbit the sun so your original assumption was correct
space,removed,yeah americans would rather be greedy religious morons who pay no taxes and learning is for weirdos

space,removed,if you grind up the rock and mix it with other rocks i suppose you lose its ages telling abilities im not too knowing but i suppose the rate and remnant radioactive isotope us a major telling sign a rock from thousand years back and another from a billion years both melted in the same pot would give you a wrong date if you carbon date it the older rock has more so when averaged out we might get like years old just a shoddy example

space,removed,its chaffee
space,removed,well youre talking to a physicist believe it or not the nuance is that while technically i suppose you could call solar wind radiation what most physicist would call radiation is either alpha beta gamma or neutron radiation which solar wind isnt both majorily or exclusively solar wind at least thats my understanding is mostly comprised of ejected hydrogen ions aka protons as well as electrons as you would expect given the suns composition helium fusion happens in the core and hydrogen is actually lower in mass so the helium is concentrated in the core and stays there if memory serves

space,removed,because all of that debris is moving at per second and in all manner of different trajectory you cant just fly from one to the next there is a reason we need ridiculously large rockets to even reach an orbit flying from one debris piece to another is incredibly expensive or time intensive aero of effect like giant magnets wont do much impact because space is just too large well probably arent ever able to build a magnet that affects the entirety of earth and even that would be ha enough to sweep even a small area of earth orbit up to geosynchronous and worst of all million pieces of debris according to the article if two satellites collide you can have thousands of little pieces of which each could rip a sizeable hole into an iss segment flying in completely different directions all over earth orbit there is no feasable way to collect them
space,removed,why is that guy still up there
space,removed,always does it for me you grow up learning about the solar system its so cool with its planets and its ability to fit on a typical piece of paper but at some point your level of knowledge gets expanded to the milky way and it blows your mind to think that our solar system is a pin prick in this seemingly massive galaxy with billions of stars you just start to come to terms with it only to have your mind exploded by an image of other galaxies each with their own billion stars its damn amazing it really leaves you thinking youre nothing not really in a depressing mopey waymore in a factual thatsjustthewayitis kinda way

space,removed,control is the point you cannot control a parachute landing it is subject to the wind then the landing on dry ground is essential to the preservation of the device as sea water infiltrating everywhere would leave water salt and bioorganisms that are essentially impossible to clean without damaging the mechanics finally the amount of fuel needed for reentry is very small compared to what is needed for take off because by the time the stage returns it no longer carries either its second stage or its payload or most of its initial fuel the weight of a parachute and its deployment mechanism would probably be comparable to the weight of the fuel needed for reentry

space,removed,this was to resolve the nasa budget and get that out of the way the congress has until midnight sep to pass a us budget or a continuing resolution it isnt much time and there is massive tea party republican opposition to obama and want him to go out without a supreme court judge nomination dismantling of obamacare possibly with a government shutdown there is all this slobbery oratory from cruz and the tea party crew about their local district jobs but these government shutdowns cause thousands and thousands of job losses the government workers go back to work but a lot of government contractors have to slash rightandleft cruz and his tea party bunch is going light on nasa to get it out of the way plus not be so contentious that obama would have to put up a big fight the stickler in there is earth sciences obama wants it to be a priority for chaotic global warming cruz et al global warming is a hoax and funding should be cut obama has come back with cutting europa to fund earth sciences a lot of people are unhappy this idea it looks like both sides made enough of a compromise so that obama will sign the nasa portion of the us budget it is pretty much a maintain a steady course compromise get the crew capsule going keep building for a mars launch the final version that is approved and signed might be available next week to see specific monetary amounts allocated for specific missions meanwhile nobody seems to be noticing or thinking about relocating from cape canaveral because in years it will be mostly underwater bezos saw this several years ago so that is why he is concentrating everything in texas launch landing and refurbish musk is looking at building a giant refurbishing facility on the cape if you look at the cape it is just a sand bar a spit in the atlantic considering nasa is already starting to see the water rising during their maintenance it seems like somebody would be raising this as a priority colony on mars how about a place to take off from earth first

space,removed,does nobody else think think this is a little fucked up poor frog
space,removed,for those reading my understanding is the schwartzchild radius of a given body of matter the size where something will turn imto a black hole is how large the event horizon will be in other words its known that if earth was forced to densify down to roughly the size of a peanut its become a black hole however the event horizon would be the size of a peanut and the black hole would only have the gravity of earth until it consumes more matter of course in fact i believe all its orbits would remain unchanged and everything that being said the grivity would only be the same at a distance once you get close yeah itll speghettify you and suck you in black holes are special in how all that mass is focused to one dimensional point and the distance between your head and feet becomes more and more significant as you grow closer because of it its kinda complicated to explain though and i just dont have the words so just imagine a peanut having the gravity of the entire earth at a safe distance that will destroy you if you get too close
space,removed,possible anything is possible possible is one thing probable is another thing and improbable theories should not be taught as fact and probable theories should the taught as a possibility take the moon formation as an example the current theory is possible but highly i mean extremely highly improbable as one put it nbsp you practically have to hold a marssized object over earth and drop it improbable yet presented as good valid and the truth nbsp and answering your question no i wont present any but lack of a better theory does not make the current any better or more valid it is ok not to know until we truly do and pushing cosmic bandaids so we have something to say is simply not the way to go nbsp science is over this is the age of deceit
space,removed,ah okay yeah i know space and time are one in the same but its easier to think of and explain to others in laymans terms if you make them different in your mind
space,removed,ah okay so they call it planck time i kept thinking of it like frames in a video and calling it a planck frame the way i imagine it once you get down to measurements that tiny youre dealing with the absolutes of the universe and either something did happen or didnt either it exists or it doesnt that sort of thing has there been any thought about how maybe thats how the universe works like maybe those absolutes are the binary and then you have quarks and atoms which work in i dunno something comparable to etc building layers upon the last i have a hard time explaining how i think in imagination but that kinda how it ends up working for me plus theyre all tied with things like probability and other possibilities and universesdimensions and all kinds of stuff everything kinda linking and hooked together in a weird jumbled mess like something that happens in our universe could affect another one etc if i really really got into every little thing i imagine id have to write a book things like maybe dark matter energy is actually matter but in another universe thats influencing ours or maybe antimatter is matter that is traveling the opposite direction through time etc i dont really get it all myself but my runon imagination comes up with all kinds of weird mumbo jumbo xd anyway thanks now ill go and look that up sometime i dont really do much science reading and i probably should i just i dunno dont have the confidence to think i can change much so i never feel motivated to bother with it all i guess
space,removed,thats just always the way it was explained to me by my father honestly his was well either its all down to one dimensional point or well ya know what it hardly matters because we cant look inside it anyway or do anything useful with it because itll just kill us just stay away from black holes nothin good will come of it haha i personally always thought of it in that feedback loop thing where it constantly collapses except i thought maybe a black hole really never stops collapsing on itself like maybe its always crushing further and further on itself infinitely approaching zero but never quite getting there i dunno

space,removed,prior to the renaissance the science of the day was predicated on the belief a belief held with literally religious fervor that man and earth were the center of all creation since then the science of the day has been predicated on the belief a belief held with literally religious fervor that man and the earth are nothing special and should be regarded as typical normal run of the mill this is the foundation of the belief that life is common and will be found virtually everywhere the belief that is the impetus for this proposed mission to titans oceans there was nothing to support the belief that the earth was the center of the universe and there is nothing to support the belief and that is all it is that the earth is representative of a typical planet in a typical solar system

space,removed,very good point unicraven indeed that august clinton speech turned out to have been too optimistic based upon the evidence at hand the evidence at hand during that time in was the meteor that contains deeply embedded elongated tubularlike shapes such as and nevertheless the stunning excitement of that clinton speech turned out to be a total dud that fizzled unfortunately in retrospect it appears unfortunately that clinton received bad scientific adviceinformation from his science related adviserssources there simply was not and still not conclusive evidence to proclaim that elongated tube as the image of an martian alien bacteriaanalog however despite that embarrassing publicfiasco of a blunder there are still many scientists that find these images highly intriguing and it would seem that they havent ruled out it is an actual image of fossilized alien life the biggest dismal against it being life is that earth bacteria cant get that small and there was a finite limit to how small bacteria could get but only a short time later here on earth after that dismissal we discovered bacteria that was far smaller than we thought was theoretically possible another key point to keep in mind is that if we detect methane accompanied by ethane and propane then that is likely much stronger evidence of life as compared to those microscopic images i linked to above of possible tine martian bacteria so i personally think it would be a fallacy and great mistake for anyone to assume that a detection of methaneethanepropane is meaningless just because we made a mistake on august the mistake back in has little to do with this possible upcoming much stronger signal detection for possible life on mars in or put differently mars data from is independent to mars data from on this topic finally for the record i just wanted to mention that i do not think those microscopic images photographed fossilized alien life back in and nor do i think for now that the exomars trace gas orbiter will detect ethanepropane along with that methane but i remain open minded and ifwhen we discover methaneethanepropane then i strongly believe that will be shockingly strong evidence that there is life today on mars underground

space,removed,im not against space exploration i just wonder if focussing on a manned mission makes sense given the amazing advances in robotics and virtual reality etc seems to me having a telepresence robot on the surface would be almost as effective and vastly cheaper without needlessly sacrificing brilliant human lives the difficulty of getting humans to mars has to be at least an order of magnitude more difficult than getting to the moon and from what ive read if we wanted to go to the moon tomorrow we couldnt because a vast amount of the engineering expertise and institutional knowledge that was developed for the apollo missions was lost im a huge space exploration fan ever since i read cosmos and saw the series with carl sagan as a kid i also saw the hideous loss of human life in the two shuttle disasters that were caused by incompetence and mismanagement my friend at nasa says that for all its brilliant talent in scientists and engineers it still suffers from a surfeit of retarded upper management types who could very well put more lives at risk

space,removed,i still dont know why they didnt know about the huge waves i mean if our little tiny moon can cause high tide and low tide then i would think a planet that is super close black hole would have a little more effect also why did they think that was a good idea to make that the next earth time would move so fast that living there for a year would be like years on earth tl to do real math so lets just say that they live there and setup a colony and everything and live there for years that would be earth years just seems like a bad idea

space,removed,for offensive linemen in particular the study provides a different perspective on the subconcussive hits—lower impact but with higher frequency—that players on the front lines absorb players were asked to report how often they experience concussionrelated symptoms after a hit compared to most other position groups offensive linemen reported more frequently experiencing symptoms that were not likely to be externally observable such as dizziness headaches and concentration difficulties the research paper suggests that many of the hits considered subconcussive may in fact be symptomatic impacts left unreported perhaps because they are more routine offensive linemen may also be less likely as a position group to selfreport for any number of reasons whether its less attention being paid to head injuries among their positionmates or a pride that they rarely come out of the game

space,removed,it is far more practical to leave the interplanetary injection vehicle in orbit since its more of a political goal than one of strictly technical progress the returned sample mass can be kept negligibly low getting the fuel for the earth injection to mars orbit would probably be a flight separate from the ascent vehicle though the scale of all of this would dwarf everything yet completed

space,removed,damn good short story that would make a really good premise for a tv show that would be the pilot everything after that is how earth becomes the big baddy in the galaxy and we start conquering others

space,removed,shut up donald no one was talking to you
space,removed,that sounds easy but everything you mentioned is harder on mars than it is on earth so whatever lifestyle you had on earth you get of that on mars by the time were realistically capable of getting large numbers of people to mars well have printers that can make just about anything we want and youll be able to grow any food you want in a vat so provided you have access to the raw materials your lifestyle will be little different no matter where in the universe you may be besides weve seen before that many people are willing to sacrifice a relatively comfortable life for the freedom of a frontier theres nothing new here the meek will inherit the earth and the brave will colonize the galaxy

space,removed,looks like jar jar binks
space,removed,hmmm looks a lot like the paramount sound stage
space,removed,awesome looking cgi
space,removed,as far as rocket technologies go those missions werent very complex im not speaking of the probes themselves but of the technology to get them to space falcon uses gas generator kerosene engines based on technology that had been largely perfected by the end of the they dont even use staged combustion yet and the soviets had that working in so far they havent really done anything to improve the performance of engines beyond what was already possible their next innovation will be to build an engine running on methane first done in germany in and use fullflow staged combustion demonstrated by glushko in the what will be genuinely new is that neither has been used to put a rocket into space yet but its hardly a technological revolution
space,removed,it doesnt look like a horsehead to me more like a spooky ghost edit autocorrect weirdly capitalizing things

space,removed,the home of evil communist who want to enslave all zypods
space,removed,good question lol nobody will probably ever know since theres no oxygen atmosphere on mars to be able to breath which in turn allows you to smell
space,removed,ill never forget the iss going over my head when i walked to the bar how often does that happen

space,removed,seriously what the fuck is this bullshit what the fuck are we paying taxes for people i think that rover should stick to doing its job instead of playing with dirt i am sick and tired of this this is our money guys and that stupid mexican fucker driving that rover is fucking with it the hell with mexicans vote trump

space,removed,wait gas giants have bands are they any good
space,removed,i expected a picture of a butthole then i saw the sub figured it wasnt so risky
space,removed,its too bad we cant have a probe on the planet so we could take a look deep inside uranus
space,removed,definitive thought it was a gag you got me to look at uranus mods before you kick me off i must ask is it possibly due to the increase in the technology and photo enhancement that we could be looking at the same thing ie my iphone camera vs my kodak disc camera in thanks for the wavelegnth info
space,removed,it looks like something was dragged over mars lol
space,removed,heh im making a game where the final chapters take place on mars in a parallel dimension except the place im using as tge last labyrinth is noctis labyrinthus

space,removed,this alone makes this very hard to believe you cant just have chunks of food out in the open floating around in a space station theres a reason space food comes in packets id believe theyre on a zero g airplane long before this is actually in the iss

space,removed,i posted mars on rearthporn once and got a day ban
space,removed,my thoughts upon seeing that
space,removed,you probably saw this copy it appears to be from this
space,removed,you can get both versions but only this one is useful for prettiness to look at other images are useful for science stuff and its on their site too it just looks bland and its harder to notice stuff
space,removed,we also keep satellites that transmit internet hotspots on mars thats my fav part because we need memes in the universe
space,removed,never underestimate the power of the dark side
space,removed,this is a marketing image for selling you on the idea mars is cool mars does not look like this and frankly this is a like any throwaway shot from anyone who has spent time on the colarado plateau in the us
space,removed,wretched hive of scum and villainy comment
space,removed,rmadlads
space,removed,wow i wonder if we can live on mars one day
space,removed,did you see the bit of the elon musk demo that explained the lengths theyre going to in order to prevent contamination i dont remember the numbers but its impressive if we can be conscious of the microbes we must sterilize i believe we can eradicate a lot of the other bullshit too it sure as shit wont be nonrecycling garbage burning gas guzzling rednecks being sent out lol humans have existed in various uhh species at the same time on the planet before like cro magnon and neandurthals co existed i think or homo saliens and cro magnons did basically i think that with exposure to an easily accessible internet from basically the moment of consciousness has lead us to evolve again now im gonna get a bit radical or out there but theres been a sharp rise in a certain disorder in the past decade when the brain starts to evolve and redistribute it very well could shed off some of our primitive behaviour itll be weird people that go ideally they will be a group of intelligent and forward thinkers who will have foresight and not fuck mars up like we fucked up earth or maybe thats it we figure out how to suck the life out of a planet and move to the next i dont really care to be honest theres more planets and stars then there are people on this planet as far as im concerned that means earth is less important than an individual life in some fucked up way holy shit i need to stop smoking so much weed
space,removed,a bunch of friends and i are getting wasted and yeah scienceing shit up on top of this hotel this is how we celebrate humanity just cause you love science and space doesnt mean you have to be a nerd how do you do it anyone else actually getting really excited and inspired by awesome shit like this or are my friends and i the coolest ones on here sometimes i just feel like yall a buncha nerdy nerds with glasses and pocket protectors and stuff

space,removed,no but the prospect of a trump presidency gives me an existential crisis
space,removed,this comment is absolute horse shit im a moderate but the republicans have a very good history with funding nasa republicans want to die rich and there arent many better ways than funding nasa reagan and both bushs funded nasa extremely well both clinton and obama have had the worst impacts on nasa george bush funded it well but the overall constellation plan while being extremely optimistic was not a good plan your comment show more bias than the article my uncle has worked for nasa and has been a democrat his entire life he has even told me though that republicans are by far nasas favorite party republicans love their space travel democrats tend to look at nasa as stealing money from what could go to welfare and other government programs here is a very well explanation of this topic
space,removed,i honestly think that nasa has no clue whats its doing seven years and theyre still scratching their heads even though theyre reusing components of the shuttle that theyve been using for decades i hope trump shit cans slsand gets musk on board to get the base building supplies on the surface of mars about half way through his term just for the sake of boosting his numbers and putting his name in the history books like what happened with jfk who cares if trump does it to boost his ego its been a half a century since we last visited the moon not only mars but we should also establish a moon base as well the moon would be a great space port we can build mass drivers on the moon as weve developed the technology to launch aircraft off the the ford aircraft carriers we just need to scale the technology up
space,removed,alot harderhmmm not that much its just stupid congress taking money away and putting it towards war instead of explorationsad sad stuff its too bad but it really looks like its time to let companies take over space exploration as their focus does not seem to sway its funny the guy is like oh yeah we are gonna help the small satelite buisiness because its boomingjesus fuck man can you even imagine a helium boom it would make your small sat boom look like a fucking fart in the windthat dude lacks vision and is only interested in how he can make short term money fucking capitalist america
space,removed,and here i am shitposting nice things about spacex all day for free damn they should write me some payslips every once in awhile protip elon musk doesnt give a fuck what you think youre not a customer the only pr that matters to spacex is good standing with satellite operators actual customers like ses and orbcomm everything else is just free friendly here you geeks might find this interesting and trying to build some hype for the ambitious mars plans
space,removed,less for the price
space,removed,honestly as an elite dangerous player i think i can at least grasp the scale since ed is a recreation of the galaxy distances feel real ive flown many thousands of light years between stars and planets and in doing so ive gained a sense of scale for example i can fathom the distance to jupiter which is lightseconds away i cant tell you how many times ive flown thousands of light seconds to get somewhere or just a few hundred so when talking about the suns scale you start to grasp it when youve flown far from earth so it is very small and are right in front of the sun and it takes up your field of view from several light seconds out where earth takes up the field of view from just a fraction of a lightsecond away

space,removed,ok i may be missing something here but the shadows on the moon dont look right assuming this isnt two videos edited together the earth is fully lit from the front ie from directly behind the camera which means that where the moon is in the picture the probe should be flying close to or directly over the terminator which means the shadows the craters ridges or mountains on the moons surface that we see should be casting shadows a lot longer than whats shown it almost looks like the moon is being illuminated from directly above the probe instead of from behind it like it should be

space,removed,checkmate
space,removed,its a lie they just want all the space pokemon for themselves
space,removed,does it mention how the assembly of those rockets was the deadliest part of the weapon system because more jews were worked to death building them than people were killed through rocket hits i think this fact draws a pretty good picture about von braun
space,removed,orion is just fascinating like always whenever i see this nebula i forget to breath
space,removed,wrong arm mister president
space,removed,if you want astrophotography why not check out rastrophotography
space,removed,i agree with op this used to be one of my goto subs but nowadays its almost a ghost town besides the news that pops up every few days also dont judge from my incept date ive been around a while
space,removed,this thread is a direct invasion due to the popularity of thread on rpics from someone who has never come here before even once
space,removed,yeah this sub doesnt blow because of this i am subscribed to rastrophotography and i really like the separation we dont need artificial filler the sub does its job and big events still rise to the top of the feed
space,removed,no way its way better without being littered by a bunch of shitty pictures of the sky
space,removed,yep used to come here all the time and found great space articles as well but its never the articles that drew me to the sub it was always the photography didnt even know about the juno probe until it was on the news whereas before i would have known about it immediately because i would be on the space sub sub has no draw anymore the information is still great and informative i just wont accidentally wind up here anymore and have to make a conscious effort to remember the sub as such its one of my least visited now
space,removed,i think ops point is that the post at the top of the front page right now would have been a decent contribution to this sub but instead its not allowed
space,removed,so fucking sick of seeing pokemon everywhere
space,removed,every day i come on here and new is just a bunch of reposts and clickbait this sub might have the least content for the number of subscribers of any sub im subscribed to i would much rather have fewer posts with a higher quality and all the reposts removed and dont even get me started on how nasas apod gets posted several times every single day
space,removed,looks like bill murray on the right
space,removed,imo i think that it is not an issue of not having content i see plenty of relevant interesting articles posted here everyday but they will end up getting thirty upvotes and less than comments it seems clear to me that a lot of the people that come to this sub arent interested in participating in discussions about space the following are a few of the threads posted in the past few hours that got fewer upvotes and comments then their topics deserved imo of couse very recent post may pick up unless the people who visit this sub are willing to postcomment on topics that are relevant to space this sub is bound to stagnate
space,removed,personally i am utterly sick and tired of seeing peoples mediocre backyard shots of jupiter the moon etc im totally for the change less frequent submissions of much higher quality images are what i am looking for
space,removed,i agree perhaps we should gradually reintroduce it but knowing the mods they wont respond to this post for hours communication isnt their strong point plus for some reason a subreddit with million subscribers only seems to have like two mods no really ive only ever seen two
space,removed,they must have met through their mutual connection tyrone slothrop
space,removed,no way we landed on the moon
space,removed,whats to think about

space,removed,this scene was improv as well watch jeff daniels he loses it
space,removed,this is the best answer the guy who works in the museum gives an answer that sounds like hes reciting an algorithm that hes been taught but he has no common sense and fails to use any reasoning in the current situation
space,removed,yeah and i feel sorry for all the people who believe eclipses are caused by a dragon swallowing the sun and all the people who sacrifice goats to thor which is to say no one exactly similar to your asinine comment seriously if you have to go to such lengths to feel superior making up imaginary fringe groups you really need to work on both your selfconfidence and your grasp of reality

space,removed,well said its quite annoying and as a layman who is a space nerd i wouldnt dare to create something based on it just because i think i know what im talking about the person that made this graphic however did not have the same apprehension and humility

space,removed,buzz lightyear
space,removed,i dont look at it as more or less or equally important as everything else all things have some importance and there is merit in doing some of everything and not completely stopping one endeavor just because there may be another that is more important according to some subjective criteria clearly many domestic issues are not discretionary you must feed the population educate them ensure their safety and so on things like this are not optional but among all other things that are art entertainment sport and so on science surely should be considered important since it has such an effect on our future
space,removed,battletoads
space,removed,clearly fake there are no stars visible and the shadows all point in different directions has to be taken in some specially set up environment maybe a large construction hall also the floor is nearly black and everyone knows the moon is bright white
space,removed,so very cool side note that rocket looks a lot like my dick when excited this vid was very exciting
space,removed,have you taken a poke at uranus yet
space,removed,those are magnificent great work
space,removed,thats why you dont take women on board
space,removed,your a troll harry
space,removed,im not bullshitting anyone fuck you very much i was asking for more details on the original raw files the fotoforensics link was just accompanying my suggestion that the blacks seems to be more pure you answered my question with a question the goto tool of a moron who clearly thinks they are much more clever than everyone
space,removed,im so used to seeing moons surface in shitty quality
space,removed,i thought crossstitching was lame until i saw this post
space,removed,but i thought that he said global warming was a hoax so we dont have anything to worry about
space,removed,funny youre clearly the idiot here
space,removed,those rocks look more weathered than id expected
space,removed,same
space,removed,some back yard photographers have captured some amazing video and pictures of space craft satellites and stations try searching the web under night vision ufo you might have to be lucky because some footage is removed i wonder why
space,removed,the one on the right looks like a colonoscopy so i thought this was actually a really bad joke
space,removed,yea but why imagine martian amphibians when bonus also each word is its own weird ass amphibian totes chek those dudes out because waouw srsly
space,removed,its about the size of america
space,removed,a better visual of uranus in and again in
space,removed,i know this is the space subreddit but my god my mind was thinking something completely different please forgive
space,removed,thats a picture of balls they always look like landscapes that close up
space,removed,everything gets old some day even you and me and uranus
space,removed,uranus sure did look smoother back in
space,removed,for the depth americans standing up or laying down
space,removed,so no you dont have any idea what congress does then thanks for telling us their job is not to pass laws a successful congress is not one that passes the most laws or even one that passes any laws we have not had a successful congress for decades
space,removed,they openly stated they serve their purpose over the peoples damn straight its high time for the tree of liberty well you know the rest
space,removed,ouranos and uranus are just different spellings they are pronounced the same way
space,removed,it appears uranas has been penetrated opening up holes that had never been seen before
space,removed,you seem to be an expert on anuses
space,removed,whats the source of this picture cuz it obviously didnt come from that rover hollywoodmoon roundearthpropaganda bigcarto flatearththeory
space,removed,looks like americans made it shocker they cant come up with their own ideas so they steal them and sell them back to us
space,removed,lmao do you guys really think this is a real photo real question it is obviously cgiquite obvious whats amazing is people are still feeding into this mind manipulation about the true nature of space
space,removed,how do you know it is
space,removed,the moon is already american property so nuking it would be an act of war against the us technically nonamericans arent even supposed to use the moon anymore but we let em anyway youre welcome
space,removed,more cgi for the sheeps to eat it up interesting if you notice that the ring around what supposed to be saturn is flat which is not supposed to be possible according to nasa gravity supposed to create a sphere unless they lied to us about that which they clearly did it bothers me because this image is a fake anyone can tell for one there are no stars in this picture space is a science fiction nothing else there are no such things as other planets either they are just stealing all your money so they can discover them and there supposed to be many thousands of these so called planets out there to explore isnt that convenient losers
space,removed,but it still hasnt found what its looking for
space,removed,low economic value in going to the moon the middle east is so much more attractice economically
space,removed,woah how many kids did they have to pull off the iphone assembly line to build that thing
space,removed,tinder for gay guys is pretty tough
space,removed,we are in a very sad state as humans we used to dream big now we fight and argue about bathrooms
space,removed,wait so are they gonna unveil their mars plans tomorrow then
space,removed,this is beautiful thanks for sharing
space,removed,five actually
space,removed,not the place stick to the nonserious subs
space,removed,damn i laughed reading it and was looking forward to the ops response and then saw your comment he got me good
space,removed,rip bananas
space,removed,haha brilliant i love it
space,removed,canonicalize making up words now are we well i think thats a little smoogelglossenish of you
space,removed,i want to be a dragon
space,removed,just send blankets to mars and put those martians in reserves problem solved
space,removed,
space,removed,why should they
space,removed,so australia has no cities with electricity
space,removed,i didnt realize how fast hurricanes typhoon move in a day
space,removed,immediately thought of this
space,removed,that weird part of youtube where no matter what you watch you end up at hippo butt explosion
space,removed,beautiful
space,removed,this would be an awesome loading screen icon
space,removed,perfect loop
space,removed,beautiful reminds me of that quote from carl sagan look again at that dot thats here thats home thats us on it everyone you love everyone you know everyone you ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives the aggregate of our joy and suffering thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every hunter and forager every hero and coward every creator and destroyer of civilization every king and peasant every young couple in love every mother and father hopeful child inventor and explorer every teacher of morals every corrupt politician every superstar every supreme leader every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived thereon a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam the earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner how frequent their misunderstandings how eager they are to kill one another how fervent their hatreds think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot our posturings our imagined selfimportance the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe are challenged by this point of pale light our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark in our obscurity in all this vastness there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves the earth is the only world known so far to harbor life there is nowhere else at least in the near future to which our species could migrate visit yes settle not yet like it or not for the moment the earth is where we make our stand it has been said that astronomy is a humbling and characterbuilding experience there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world to me it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot the only home weve ever known ― carl sagan pale blue dot a vision of the human future in space

space,removed,cant decide if elon is a genius or a lunatic
space,removed,war of the worlds hype
space,removed,i like how stealing underpants is going to fund this apparently
space,removed,it looks like all clouds are just part of or big clouds
space,removed,these questions are triggering me
space,removed,hahahahahahaha hey elon this guy on reddit said it would be ok in sentences
space,removed,wrost qa ever
space,removed,so did anyone feel sorry for the guy with the last question
space,removed,damn this is sexy
space,removed,ama request spacex mariachi band
space,removed,is there a difference between geostationary and geosynchronous
space,removed,interplanetarystill relies on oil yaaaa no
space,removed,america has won a science victory civ
space,removed,i cant help but notice they dont come back
space,removed,i hate saying this but it looks like a giant tampon
space,removed,glad i am not the only one that is allergic to people like that i closed the browser three times during the talk even the guys praising elon for his inspiration and accomplishments were annoying as fuck random guy xy your praise means nothing you are worthless scum just ask a simple questen for fucks sake no one asked were to land when can we start to contaminate mars will nasa ever allow that will you listen terraforming how much do i have to save to go there i am sad
space,removed,plus there are massive sandstorms darude will be right at home then
space,removed,nuke them
space,removed,how much shit would you say you eat on a daily basis
space,removed,one ticket to uranus please
space,removed,i hope we learn our lesson from earth and only allow asians and whites to colonize mars lets not ruin a whole planet right off the bat
space,removed,now they just have to make it off the launch pad
space,removed,so much dick sucking
space,removed,sure it is him
space,removed,anyone have ideas on how that crane arm can come out of that tiny top bit lift an entire shuttle move it drop it and retract back in
space,removed,this got me sooooo hypeeee
space,removed,roddlysatisfying
space,removed,since the ssme are basically the same engines as the saturn vs eh not really no
space,removed,quick theyre summoning sargeras and his legion stop them
space,removed,apologies if you are so disabled that you cant check the subreddit for recent posts before posting it yourself

space,removed,heeeeees outraaaageous
space,removed,are there solar systems and planets inside of the nebula
space,removed,amazing
space,removed,wrong
space,removed,mesarthim isolate
space,removed,really look more like the minecraft pickaxe nebula
space,removed,of course you are because you dont have a goddamn thing to say about it other than politics fuck youve been doing this so long youre past good at it and straight to automatic response you and your ilk are wasting the air we breathe and should be ejected like donald wants to eject the other meat puppets wasting our country youre a fucking disgrace im a shitty human being but i dont make any bones about it youre the evil that walks your kind corrupts and lies and lines our world with disingenuous bullshit simply to interrupt discussion you know nothing you only do salting the earth beneath your vituperative attack on the people that actually make things and learn if humanity is to survive we must divest ourselves of you and donald is going to be the start
space,removed,mph
space,removed,reminds me of this
space,removed,looks like a big ass titty
space,removed,very strong actuallysuper strong actually ultra strong actually omg too strong actually
space,removed,any meaningful presence in space will depend on private industry making a profit and ultimately not the governments of earth
space,removed,this guy waters
space,removed,saturn is always so photogenic
space,removed,the chinese have proven though that they can be quite efficient the ways and speed they have changed and developed their country the last decades is staggering very impressive actually
space,removed,
space,removed,uhhhh so is your mom
space,removed,samurai cop
space,removed,no mans sky
space,removed,glad im not the only one
space,removed,looks like the universal pictures intro
space,removed,redditors are finding corruption in our government here
space,removed,there is hardly any point to exploring individual sites that are the same as millions of others
space,removed,strictly speaking you cant change the specific heat of a substance by adding salt to water you are now heating a salt water mixture the specific heat of does not change unless you change the chemical composition of the ice you want to melt youre not going to change its specific heat and youre not going to change the amount of energy required to melt it
space,removed,itt literally over people saying they misread it as crayons the few comments on topic are buried
space,removed,steepnot sheep
space,removed,i misread that as crayons was very confused for a minute or so
space,removed,hey
space,removed,education is for liberal scum
space,removed,so lakes
space,removed,i at first misread canyons as crayons and was very confused
space,removed,oh fuck
space,removed,read crayons would color again
space,removed,crap i thought it said crayons
space,removed,read that as crayons was deeply disappointed
space,removed,nothing on earth could survive on titan tardigrades
space,removed,grunts home planet
space,removed,passengers
space,removed,looks like matrix glitch
space,removed,and for those who havent noticed look at the usernames here and on yt op isnt confused theyre the ones trying it to quote myself last time this happened as this guy is even using the same footage this link is just looping with some music over it originally filmed feb
space,removed,i read it as that too
space,removed,spinoza
space,removed,what were you hunting for if i may ask
space,removed,welcome to my savedposts list i love you
space,removed,cool find op
space,removed,its a fucking alien for sure look at those reptilian eyes
space,removed,shouldnt they call it google mars then google solar system
space,removed,sounds fun
space,removed,hockey time
space,removed,it is
space,removed,yes yes it can source am alive
space,removed,i believe this liquid also contains trace amounts of midichlorians
space,removed,ice sheet not water ice
space,removed,what is up with all the climate change denial going on in here
space,removed,thank you for the chart
space,removed,ifl science reports they chose their source unwisely
space,removed,well sheet son
space,removed,but why rename that specific star
space,removed,whats a red sprite
space,removed,for a moment i thought i was on rnottheonion
space,removed,thunderstorms are a hoax created by the chinese government to take our jobs
space,removed,neat
space,removed,this article is very much clickbait einsteins special theory of relativity states that independent observers will always measure the same speed for light in a vacuum regardless of their frame of reference how fast theyre moving general relativity addresses gravity and the curvature of spacetime and that isnt what the variable speed of light theory is about its trying to solve the problem of homogeneity in the universe which we currently use inflation to explain an extremely rapid expansion of the universe right after the big bang proving this would just modify the equations used for general relativity to make the speed of light a variable dependent on time instead of a constant making inflation unnecessary and wouldnt contradict special or general relativity at all
space,removed,i didnt know sprite made red colored drinks
space,removed,blackie
space,removed,freakin bahamut
space,removed,ignore the article
space,removed,source
space,removed,neat thanks man
space,removed,or real life
space,removed,space both old and new is awesome
space,removed,aliens
space,removed,elves emission of light and very low frequency perturbations due to electromagnetic pulse sources hmm i feel like this is a classic backronym haha
space,removed,again my point is that you added nothing to the conversation except a snide comment the original comment covered the whole thick ice thing you simply restated it and not even as accurately as people who posted before you
space,removed,i drew that with my spirograph
space,removed,moons being bros
space,removed,i had a tiny bit of anxiety that the this was going to cut off early
space,removed,is anyone else wondering what is
space,removed,i mean you cant watch gundam without expecting it to adhere to at least some of the shonen anime tropes which almost always includes some hamfisted romance ive just accepted that those are factors that will be prevalent in all gundam iterations so i try to judge them based on other characteristics that do change so in that regard i still very much like ms team because while the dialog and romance were pretty shit the depiction of combat was some of the least superroboty of any of the series i think the original actually does a pretty good job too of keeping the superrobot thing in check while the original gundam is definitely super powered its not like blowupaspacecolonyinoneshot kind of over powered looking at you wing zero and the subsequent universal century series whatever their faults have really flushed out the uc setting in very interesting ways
space,removed,this update is
space,removed,far out
space,removed,thanks haha
space,removed,that was a really good read thanks
space,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikilunarsoilharmfuleffectsoflunardust
space,removed,this is really cool and you just cleared a huge misconception i had about the integrated truss structure i was sure that the truss segment was attached to the forward mbm of the truss apparently its only strutted to the destiny lab and theres a space between the two trusses and is completely independent of the rest of the structure ive been building iss replicas in ksp the wrong way for so long mind blown just one suggestion for an update you should model the nadir cbms on node and like the zenith port on node
space,removed,your granny was awesome
space,removed,aliens
space,removed,this looks like a vector image
space,removed,wowzers that was actually pretty exciting thank you moon thank you nasagif
space,removed,youre very brave whatever that dot may be it is now earth in my eyes
space,removed,why do i feel like these are all computer generated
space,removed,yes yes it is
space,removed,ignorance

space,removed,httpsgfycatcompointedskinnyegret
space,removed,it looks like the eye of sauron
space,removed,wow gotta make captain spacedick happy with your post s
space,removed,download youtube videos from here
space,removed,this phot just gave me goosebumps
space,removed,someone needs to eli this not what we see but how we are able to get thus kind of picture
space,removed,also the startup
space,removed,what are the size of these mountain anything we can use for scale
space,removed,colorizebot
space,removed,thats kind of interesting but its weird how im seemingly the only person who didnt know this
space,removed,shut up and take my uovote
space,removed,at first i looked at those mountains and thought wow pluto is a lot smaller than i thought if you could hotairballoon on pluto youd be seeing like half the entire planet and then you mentioned that the plain of nitrogen ice is the size of texas but the mountains are km tall i am thoroughly confused now
space,removed,damn son whered ya find this
space,removed,youre still a planet to me fam
space,removed,man all these other planets blow ass
space,removed,i bet the physics of the moon sanddustetc in this video is about the best proof ive seen too that and you know facts
space,removed,didnt know my anus was so valuable
space,removed,it means that within the next years were going to have to start getting very creative with how we handle continuing moores law as i see it we have a few different options im on mobile though let me switch and ill type on a real keyboard
space,removed,i imagine this had to be a final action of a rover i forget the exactly temperature but the heat of venus is nothing to sneeze at
space,removed,pretty freaky deaky duuude
space,removed,hunt for for nice girl next door in jerk off
space,removed,is this a planet in no mans sky
space,removed,not going to answer any questions pertaining to ducksized horses then why bother
space,removed,if you look closely you can see the number on a rock
space,removed,i said it sounds loud
space,removed,looks like a shit beach
space,removed,americans dont care about russian astronauts so why waste time reporting their names on some shitty throwaway social media
space,removed,nifty
space,removed,look if he were building a nuclear thermal or fission fragment rocket or a massive array for beampropulsion to get there that would be unprecedented if hes just using a reusable refuelable orbital docking chemical rocket thats kerbal space shit nothing that hasnt been thoroughly explored in both theory and realistic simulations of orbital mechanics that encourage practical solutions to the challenges of space exploration since the on to today ksp players have made shit to get to duna that use the same methods elon wants to use to go to mars many many times honestly its less efficient than it could be if he had a lander and interplanetary transport tug if he did use a nuclear thermal rocket tug theyd be doing something unprecedented thats grade a ksp play
space,removed,because this is an ignorant assumption youre putting forth on a whole nation not a reality by any provable means its not a throwaway but rather official social media sites for space exploration agencies its not the actual record its not a news website its a social media post that is a throwaway post
space,removed,no just minutes or hours
space,removed,deleted response from uthedefaultssuck because this is an ignorant assumption youre putting forth on a whole nation not a reality by any provable means americans view russians unfavorably that is a fact go ahead and google it its not a throwaway but rather official social media sites for space exploration agencies its not the actual record its not a news website its a social media post that is a throwaway post grow up please a guy who posts photos of weed to reddit all day just told me to grow up thats fucking hilarious get a job moron dont feel a need to backtrack stick up for your words stay woke buddy others are insults dont sway me ya cum guzzler take care we should show our true colors
space,removed,remindme hours
space,removed,rplutoisaplanet
space,removed,so i was at burning man and there werent a lot of port a potties are you making like space toilets because otherwise therell be a lot of shit everywhere and itll stink
space,removed,plenty of americans do they dont americans generally dont like russians bury your head in the sand further please
space,removed,no thanks
space,removed,what age range will the first martians be
space,removed,how do we poo poo
space,removed,looks like the venus one from earlier
space,removed,i like the one they banned me from rspacex for asking did you guys really hire a marksman to shoot a fueled mockup during your investigation a known insider posted that in a large thread they nuked over there and anyone mentioning it gets permsbanned for subverting moderator action
space,removed,we dont like to ban people as long as no one asks about the hired marksman that guy talked about or posts an archive link full of it
space,removed,is that a subwide rule or just for this ama might explain why the mods are so fascist over there
space,removed,h y p e r l o o p
space,removed,and let us play among the starrrsss
space,removed,
space,removed,as a random person k
space,removed,got hugh mungos right here
space,removed,because people as a whole care more about artificial borders and power for themselves than they do working together to better humanity
space,removed,well if he doesnt do it then nobody will
space,removed,it hasnt it just scaled down in the saturn v era you had superpowers channelling their political will and their citizens imagination into huge space programs now of the comments you get on space videos are retards believing the earth is flat and spouting nonsense its a decidedly different atmosphere and budget space programs run on nowadays but technology has progressed regardless in some areas more than others
space,removed,anyone know what software was used in this video
space,removed,this is a false flag obviously the space shuttle is taking the real thing to orbit s
space,removed,he called an audible while posting
space,removed,i think we may rapidly need a giant spatial parasol and he maybe should forget the mars colonisation nonsense and work on that
space,removed,vacuum is a fun word vaaaacuuuuuuum
space,removed,it sounds like there needs to be an infinite amount of things to happen for life to exist i thought the opposite that it simply took the basic ingredients and conditions plus time apparently microbial life arose quite early after the formation of our planet there is no reason it cant happen all over the universe just as spontaneously and in a variety of forms
space,removed,viva la robosistance
space,removed,ur vacuuming a big vacuum
space,removed,you mean a vacuuuum
space,removed,uhhhh well weve visited all the planets and every large moon has been imaged neptunes third largest moon nereid wasnt imaged by voyager in detail because of how far away from neptune it is year orbital period so all we have is a blurry dot its got a diameter of km which is about half the diameter of mimas so were not missing much there similarly the largest moon of jupiter himalia km again hasnt been imaged as more than a blurry dot all moons down to have been imaged around saturn uranuss sycorax hasnt been imaged and thats it we havent missed much in terms of moons around the planets just a couple of lumpy potatoes moons around kuiper belt objects though thats another story
space,removed,what are those bubbles on the surfaces of the craft
space,removed,come on op thats obviously me blowing sick vape rings with my new mod at last my talent has be recognized
space,removed,were not talking about space in its entirety were taking about launching the falcon and then having it reland on earth
space,removed,heres an excellent video explaining how time works httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvtkgtxtdlqa

space,removed,never went on the moon
space,removed,they didnt go to mars
space,removed,right thats the point
space,removed,i thought the same thing

space,removed,its a behelit
space,removed,glad i got youre approval 👍
space,removed,thats a mothafuckin behelit
space,removed,yeah next time nasa should bring a banana for scale
space,removed,anyone else kinda bummed that were calling this an egg rock labels like this shift the conversation from science physics to aliens conspiracy cheapens the find imo
space,removed,illuminati comfirm

space,removed,uranus does though fixed your apology
space,removed,pluto is a planet steps off soapbox
space,removed,that seal looks high af
space,removed,ironically i think it gets less love than neptune
space,removed,in all seriousness uranus needs a new fly by or better yet someone to put something in orbit theres some serious shit going down out there right now its a great joke but in seriously uranus is having some really odd weather right now
space,removed,i love it when people try to pronounce it like yurinus to avoid the jokes
space,removed,uranus has a ring is blue and very gaseous
space,removed,source
space,removed,its

space,removed,the correct answer is crowbar you carry a crowbar everywhere locked door crowbar jammed panel crowbar zombie infestation crowbar black mesa interdimensional disaster crowbar combine invades the planet crowbar forgot code to your padlock crowbar
space,removed,now that black lives matter people take hostages on the freeway all the time this is actually a good idea
space,removed,this is just amazing so detailed no cuts the view from cupola with the docked spaceships left my jaw open

space,removed,wtf we tried to deliver your parcel but you were out
space,removed,and wash away the raaaaaainn
space,removed,i came here expecting a fart joke to be the top comment i dont know if im impressed or disappointed
space,removed,psa if you dont like it make your own space oriented subreddit and leave you are in a default subreddit right now as such they are now required to pander to the lowest common denominator of reddit they will not change their management because what they have has gotten them to a default status they won already at the subreddit game with or without your approval and ps telling the mods to get their shit together without being willing to do what i just suggested is a dick move
space,removed,yours is a shitty analogy there is no limit to the number of subreddits theres a geolimit on the number of countries i cant start a new country within america i can start a new subreddit within reddit its a shitty analogy make a better one then we can talk
space,removed,my problem is the approach and tone telling a group of volunteers to get their shit together as just another user thats not acceptable its rude pure and simple bad manners and im the guy who has a problem
space,removed,if theres mods and one gives the ok then its very easy to communicate it to the other this isnt rocket science this is bad moderating
space,removed,youre not allowed to make such a weak argument after being a redditor for years dude im not trying to be a dick here im being real your post wont change things it wont its like the equivalent of going to disneyland and demanding they do something special to the park for you youre just one person even if it was a thousand people upvoting this post thats a tiny portion of the entire userbase subscribed look at rfood shitty sub shitty mods what happened rtastyfood cropped up it was trending earlier this week you can make new subs and promote them and they do work but the thing is you have to do work too forgive any hostility you might read from me but im not being hostile im being adamant your post wont change things again the mods do not need to change a thing theyve reached the top of the mod game theyre a default changing things could lose them that status this has played out in countless subs for years it always ends the same but if you want to pick up nails off the floor and drive them into wool walls forever be my guest youre effectively banging your head against a wall all i did was suggest the only thing that is guaranteed to work if youre willing to put in the effort and youre not so forgive me if i dont pay attention to your desires
space,removed,what i dont get was on what legal grounds did it become barred
space,removed,theyre really stingy about adding new mods for some reason
space,removed,apparently the mods didnt like this post and removed it too shame im not invested enough in this sub to care unsubbed problem solved maybe when they lose subscribers theyll realize they have an issue

space,removed,okay so this is the last time im going to respond to you you fuckin moonflower wannabe this is the fucking context of the discussion at hand the vast emptiness of space as compared to shock the ocean this is not fucking redundant people refer to space singular noun referring to the void between the fucking stars as vast emptiness all the fucking time key words part of space like part of the ocean not an amount of space a part of it implying that we are talking about a single discrete fucking object further note that this is the same fucking person as who is drawing a distinction between the space that they are discussing and the earth being located in it but not vast or empty which are the terms that they used to characterize space ucrystaljack himself or herself is referring to space as being notearth again space as a discrete object that our planet is in just like once more the comparison between an island and an ocean the vacuum of space the dimensions of fucking height depth and width do not inherently contain fucking vacuum httpssciencenasagovastrophysicsfocusareaswhatisdarkenergy gosh this is all painting a pretty straightforward fucking picture do you think they mean dimensionsofheightdepthandwidth travel because like shit im pretty sure google maps beat them to that now go waste someone elses time you stupid fucking troll

space,removed,gotta get dat eezo
space,removed,trumps campaign can be summed up as bad all bad the worst bads ever but
space,removed,and when the appointment amounts to nothing and musk resigns because his falls on the deaf ears of a man who rigged the whole thing as a stunt or they mutually part ways it wont matter because all he wanted was this headline and it wont cost him anything later if musk tells everybody what a fool trump is because theres literally nothing that will ever turn off his base
space,removed,i never said it was a fact you fucking goober
space,removed,same with star trek it literally takes before first contact is made with the vulcans
space,removed,hopefully he doesnt say something he shouldnt and get his companies wiped out in response
space,removed,thats the first good news youve heard you ever think maybe your news source perhaps isnt as fair as it should be
space,removed,hes done other good things to like plans to remove military support from syria
space,removed,you are not wrong that being said anything can happen at this point we could have had it much worse than trump we should be grateful which candidate was worse than trump
space,removed,go take a look at rpolitics if you spend minutes in there youll leave thinking that trump its just a matter of days until trump is arrested or deposed or that a electoral college revolt will take place soon
space,removed,i bet you are real shit at understanding statistical probability all of his actions tell the story of who he is and that story should have everyone really fucking worried but you all over here like la la la nothings happened yet get a clue
space,removed,only right wing news carries truth wah wah wah dont trust the media because my orange god said so
space,removed,they call him will
space,removed,nope the first time i heard good news from the trump camp it meant that hillary clinton would not be our president thank fucking god shes gonna die in the next year anyways she shows signs of brain damage and parkinsons
space,removed,cucks are trying so hard to spin this in a negative light too funny
space,removed,three or more items and is used for two items kthxbai
space,removed,so a fool beat hillary clinton the denial and butthuet is strong with this one
space,removed,smaht
space,removed,lmao musk needs that sweet sweet taxpayer money sellout
space,removed,oh fuck i can get an uber to mars
space,removed,wow you sure showed them using that patronising smiley face its hilarious that when people write edgy comments claiming news sites are biased they literally never list good alternatives i know the reason too its because youre scared that your choice in news sites will be outed as being biased too so go on list your choice in news sites i dare you
space,removed,the existence of mars is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese government in order to trick the us into wasting money on a space exploration mission to get there

space,removed,yes yes please
space,removed,
space,removed,holy shit this is awesome
space,removed,more unexpected that trump becoming president lol
space,removed,of course hes going to go against his rhetoric it was unrealistic at best even back when he announced it i dont deny the cabinet picks having bad histories of being extremely conservative on issues where liberal freedom has been the best course of action homosexuality marijuana etc you can be keen or not the fact is you cant do jack shit about it like i said if you want to type stuff on reddit and jerk off to it to relieve yourself youre welcome and i mean that laconically but not with malintent to me it seems a waste of energy the civilian population knows when things go from bad to worse unless you intend to lead a movement against trump you wont achieve much by wasting time typing on reddit
space,removed,their stock fell all of and it closed higher that day than it had the day before not exactly a crushing blow

space,removed,essentially dooming our chances of preventing catastrophic global warming do you really think that the damage being done by china and india arent worse then what we are doing he talked with obama about obamacare for an hour right before appointing someone who pledged to dismantle it and leave million more people uninsured this is a lie he says during the transition of replacing obamacare no one will lose coverage they certainly never said million people would lose coverage in the process trump likes bringing important people to his tower to grovel before him and then goes ahead with his plan to destroy america like the meeting never even happened how is he destroying america bringing back jobs and stopping illegal immigration doesnt seem like destroying it to me at this point i wouldnt be surprised if he follows up his meeting with tech leaders by pledging to ban all technology you have a mental illness if you think this and should get help at one point in the campaign he talked about shutting down the internet so you cant pretend you werent warned you really are fucked he was talking about isis using the internet to recruit and spread terror he does have some ignorance towards the internet as a yr old but he was talking about not allowing internet access to isis which yea is a silly old man thing to say but in no way did he talk about shutting down the internet

space,removed,and thats why youre not a lawyer lol people and companies settle for all kinds of reasons one thing thats become more and more true with the birth of the internet is that the more something gets repeated the more people believe it so if a billionaire is dealing with a lawsuit over a completely fabricated accusation and it only costs a million bucks or something to get it to just go away and not get dragged through the media for a few months they do it its hard to see paying somebody a million dollars to go away as anything but a legal form of bribery when you dont have that kind of money but imagine if somebody told you that over the next hours they were going to force you to stub your toe and you knew as a matter of fact that their threat is legitimate would you pay them if they agreed to not make you stub your toe and also agreed in writing to never make you stub your toe from that point forward now what if the threat is that theyre going to knock you on your head hard enough to give you a concussion you could let them do that and then press charges or you could pay them to just not do that im going to pay them the thats what these peoplecompanies are thinking when they settle out of court

space,removed,holy condescending batman you can do one long minute exposure at that exposes for only the rockets engine there will be no breaks in the trail with a single long exposure at and iso because the initial shot of the launch used such a narrow aperture the foreground will lack detail and you wont see many if any stars then you can take a second exposure to expose for the foreground and stars you then merge them thats what was done in the ula photograph i linked hdr high dynamic range you expose for the bright part of the scene the rockets flight and then expose for the dimmer stars and dark foreground sometimes its done in the opposite order but its the exact same concept by the way if you were to have a small gap in the exposure due to stopping exposures in the middle of the launch you could still stack the photos youd be using a tripod and can simply overlay the frames in photoshop source httpwwwjohnkrausphotoscom and i personally know the person who took this photo let me know if you have any other questions about the process id be more than happy to explain

space,removed,all i can think about is how any moon that was that close to jupiter would be ripped apart by the tidal forces into rings if you look at metis which is miles from jupiter and lies inside jupiters rings jupiter would have an apparent size of around degrees edge to edge to be close enough to jupiter to have it take up the whole sky like that you would have to be insanely close you could get that perspective if you filmed with a camera from a long distance and zoomed though this is the technique that people use to make the moon look larger than it really is against the horizon
space,removed,jupiter wouldnt actually look that big if you were standing on europa the filmmakers own words now this photo is also taken with a very long lens so jupiter although huge would not appear anything like this to a human standing on the moon for a person standing on io jupiter would take up about degrees of the sky that is times the size in the sky of our moon as seen from earth that must still be an impressive sight and from europa which is in an orbit further out from io and where this particular shot takes place jupiter would take up nearly degrees of the sky about times larger than our moon appears to us from earth source httpwwwerikwernquistcomwanderersgalleryeuropaviewhtml

space,removed,long duration human waste disposal has always fascinated me in a zero g enclosed environment even during the gemini and first apollo flights i know they are talking about urine feces and menstrual requirements for this but perspiration and vomit should be included in such an enclosed space as a suit you need to consider a lot of factors and diapers can only cover part of that for a short time i think ill make a submission the this nasa challenge new materials have change the way we can absorb water even from solids and semifluids containing solids i can think of several simple design changes that could be integrated into a suit that would make it more comfortable for astronauts but not entirely pleasant if the object of this is only survival for hours thats only days those days would be on almost zero food intake and limited water intake so less waste going out of those elimination holes in our bodies to begin with fluids tend to cling to surfaces inside a spacesuit such that your own sweat over six day could become a drowning hazard as would vomit immediately but i have a solution for that and solutions for all the fluids and waste below the belt this might not be as big a problem as they think it is divide and conquer each issue separately while still have it integrated into one system such as a pressurized suit is as simple as compartmentalizing sections turn this project over to a high school competition and they would be eager to solve it rather than sit in shit for six days when theyre a bit older
space,removed,in modern astronomy constellations and asterisms are different things constellations are regions that the celestial sphere is divided into when astronomers talk about constellations they are not referring to any representation or pattern in particular instead it is simply a zone in the sky defined by boundaries there are modern constellations or regions that are used as a reference frame to establish the position of an object in the sky asterisms are the particular imaginary lines and shapes associated with objects stars nebulae etc in the night sky some stars form very recognisable patterns eg the three stars in what we call orions belt many cultures across the world had their own interpretations for these for the egyptians the same stars represented the god sah and for the vikings they were three fishermen these asterisms are of no real use in modern astronomy anymore although they were the basis for our current model ie our constellations are regions surrounding certain asterisms derived from ancient near east greek and arabic traditions but the main answer to your question is that you simply havent spent enough time looking at the stars ancient peoples saw patterns in the sky because thats what they saw every night for centuries and eventually became familiar with them and associated a group of stars with a god an object or any other cultural concept light pollution has contributed greatly to our relative lack of knowledge of the night sky too so yes in a way stars have faded away because our own city lights are brighter than starlight

space,removed,not only that just look up at the night sky whether you can see it or not light from trillions of stars is making it to your retinas every second but all that you can discern comes from within the milky way sure some photons are coming from other galaxies but unless you pay special attention and are relatively free of light pollution eg the andromeda galaxy all objects you personally consciously discern are from within our own galaxy and all stars you can individually discern are always from within our own galaxy this particular example is extragalactic which is what makes it special

space,removed,i always say space enthusiasts should be the first in line to support biological longevity research why because unlike majority of population they are the ones who are the true believers of science and technology of physics being the ultimate law of the universe and that our lifespans limits are the result of biology which is an emergent layer on top of physics and that there is nothing in the laws of physics that puts a limit of or on a carbonbased lifeform of surmounting insurmountable odds and accomplishing something of knowing that naysayers would always be there but it cannot get in the way of dreams and so on and yet they seem to be as much of a deathist as of the world drowned in proaging trance the belief that somehow aging and death are natural andor good andor inevitable andor the way it is supposed to be i make this bold claim because i frequent rspace and rastronomy as part of my reddit browsing and almost never see any comment or post cherishing or looking forward to the idea of if we can go to the moon we can figure out a way to live past an arbitrary limit of maybe if this resonates with you then i urge you to look into this matter a little more my past comments have tons of useful links that you can go through for more details space may be the final frontier but that also means there are a bunch of frontiers that are of more urgent nature before we get there and the frontier of death is down right one of those

space,removed,have you seen robert zubrin talk about going to mars hes the guy who created mars direct which nasa turned into the mars design reference mission from which andy weir gleaned all of the sciency stuff in the martian in when zubrin talks to congress about how were throwing away the momentum we created during the apollo and even shuttle days senator brownback his name always sounds like a fictional character to me commented that zubrin seemed passionate but pissed he is passionate but pissed people use that as a good reason to dismiss him as a crank but they should consider the reason why he is pissed jfk said we are going to be awesome we are going to the moon we are going to catch up with and then totally trounce those sneaky russians with their sputniks and space chimps and to do this we need people to become the scientists and engineers and pilots people with the right stuff who will design and build this marvelous future basically the american dream circa jfk robert zubrin young enough to not yet have his idealism ground away and replaced with cynicism heard this and decided right then and there to devote his life to supporting this new dream he got degrees in math nuclear engineering aeronautics and astronautics he got a job with martin marietta a company that was started specifically to build the technologies we would need to go into space and right about then we became a country of fucking bureaucrats with no vision whatsoever the american dream was revealed to be the same kind of propaganda we were always accusing the russians of engaging in zubrin has been walking around in a fugue state ever since i was born a few years later so i was already cynical about the whole thing when they gave me the big build the future speech in junior high the week after reagan said he was pretty sure he was overseeing the end days foretold in the bible so mutually assured destruction in a nuclear inferno might not be such a bad thing if it is all part of the plan﻿ but listening to congress talk about all of the reasons to not crank the space program back up their concerns are quite rational if we live in a time when safety is more important than progress and if people hear nasas budget is and think more american taxpayer money down the drain without considering how that money directly employs americans and most of the rest must be spent on american products or services if those things are true and they apparently are then staying out of space is a really good practice for our bureaucrat blameavoiding politicians to follow which makes me so goddam happy that there are private industry space programs ramping up because that jfk speech wouldnt fly today it would just get everyone pointing fingers and bitching about safety and budgets the first time the space shuttle landed i walked in to shop class and all the machines were off even that dustcollection whine and my teacher thanks mr andelin had snagged a tv cart and cleared a space for it in front of the desks he kept talking about how we were too young to remember the moon landing but we would have this we would remember the day space was made accessible we would live in a future that we couldnt even imagine yet he was partly right i built a tvjammer the pinnacle of juniorhigh electronics projects in his class when i was twenty years later i was designing computers that fit inside pockets a decade after that i could wander off into the desert and still check my email bring up gps maps look at images that frickin robots are sending back from mars and the edges of the solar system images from the dawn of time taken by space telescopes but i wont live to see people go further than low earth orbit and barring some extremely unlikely immense change in attitude nobody will see humans on another planet for many generations to come trips to other stars even robotic ones might never take place because our planning horizons rarely extend past the next quarters results nobody is going to fund a project that they wont live to see no politician will fund a project they wont live to take credit for and the private space industry that is springing up is a sideeffect of the internet bubble it never would have happened if there werent some bright driven people who became filthy rich in years instead of decades or lifetimes
space,removed,youre making space exploration sound like star trek or mass effect when in reality the distances are so absurdly vast and the amount of humanfriendly content is so absurdly low that even if we start terraforming mars or sending people in ships soon it will not be an enjoyable experience compared to exploring the wonders already on earth it will mostly be time spent inside metal walls you would have to manipulate reality itself to make it fun and by that time it would no longer matter we appeared on earth and adapted to that planet and there is no other place in the universe that can better accommodate our needs due to this fact its not even about the microchip or the new toys but our basic human needs as sentient animals so ive always been a fanatic of space exploration but this particular too early too late meme and yes its just that a meme is just a bizarre way of seeing things im much more excited about the idea that we could potentially be free of medical issues and soul crushing labor if we dont mess up and be then left free to enjoy a whole bunch of nice things on a planet that is already within our reach and that has been the cradle of human sorrow and happiness for a long ass time you are creating artificial sadness for an artificial problem

space,removed,congrats on catching up to nasa
space,removed,wait you mean we have to pay for it oh nevermind then
space,removed,they were right the military aspect was the reason it ended up having such a retarded design crossrange for a polar orbit once around mission to capture a soviet satellite plus a large enough cargo bay to carry military sats made it into a huge spaceplane which had to be sidemounted and necessitated the srbs but by the time it actually flew most of those goals had been abandoned as unrealistic

space,removed,criticism of global warming is not taboo and it happens frequently a scientist who has a hypothesis counter to accepted evidence needs a solid base to argue from as this subject has been argued to death if they are promoting a crackpot theory eg does not cause warming then unsurprisingly people will question their motives they would have no problem getting funding from denialist organisations but they would want to be very sure of their hypothesis just as astronomers dont go looking for funding to prove that the planets and sun orbit the earth not in this country we dont not in any first world country are you serious umm yes there is a lot of controversy over fake papers in the medical field to support drug trials there is big money in play to justify certain drugs are safe it is a controversial area and the number of papers released on individual drugs is dwarfed by the volume of papers on climate change

space,removed,im pretty confident they had the first powered flight nope not by a long shot of course hot air and hydrogen filled balloons have been lifting people off the ground since at least and the chinese have had man lifting kites for centuries before that the first powered flight was a lighterthanair craft flown in by henri giffard granted that was a lighterthanair craft the first nonkite heavierthanair craft was built by the father of the aeroplane sir george cayley in cayley constructed a model glider having the layout of a conventional modern aircraft with a wing towards the front and adjustable tail at the back with both tailplane and fin by his machines were large enough to carry a child by full grown men were flying his craft meanwhile in frenchman jeanmarie le bris made the first flight higher than his point of departure by having his glider lalbatros artificiel pulled by a horse on a beach the first parasailer but those were gliders not counting the horse powered one the first successful powered manned flight was in félix du temple achieved a short hop with a fullsize steam powered manned aircraft it achieved liftoff under its own power after launching from a ramp glided for a short time and returned safely to the ground making it the first successful manned powered heavierthanair flight in history of course it still needed a ramp to get into the air so it wasnt exactly entirely self powered from to gustave whitehead designed and built early flying machines and engines on august two and a half years before the wright brothers flight he carried out a controlled powered flight near fairfield connecticut whiteheads flight is considered to be the first manned powered controlled flight of a heavierthanair craft so the wrights werent the first to fly they werent the first powered flight they werent the first heavierthanair powered flight either neither were they the first to do a controlled powered manned heavierthanair flight the wright brothers were the first to fly a manned craft that lifted off under its own power alone reached altitudes greater than the launch point sustained that flight under control in the presence of photographers caveat upon caveat upon caveat the wright brothers were the last people to invent the airplane

space,removed,hes always so encouraging but hes been wrong before
space,removed,so i work in computational research which means i work with people from all the disciplines and without a doubt the brilliant physicists are several orders of magnitude smarter than any other kind of person i meet ever as in they know biology anthropology mathematics and a good portion of the time they are also quite good with other people i think its just a difficult subject that attracts in many cases exceptionally intelligent people

space,removed,what the hell does he know he doesnt even know to walk
space,removed,in all honesty why would anyone listen to a retard in a wheelchair
space,removed,thats what kills me about the average american voter they dont seem to understand that politics is an expertise and profession just like any other just because youre intelligent or good in some random field doesnt mean you should be president you want someone who knows what theyre fucking doing whenever someone says to me i just want an outsider i want someone like me in the white house i say if you had a horrible toothache would you go to an architect to have it fixed if you needed emergency surgery would you go to a carpenter to be operated on no and here we are with presidentelect trump sigh

space,removed,who the fuck does hawking think he is he isnt an authority in the field of survival of the human civilization lets give trump access to the red button instead
space,removed,its a red herring your comment is completely irrelevant to the problems human civilization is facing
space,removed,the point is being a brilliant physicist doesnt necessarily carry over into other subjects it doesnt matter how good he is at astrophysics it doesnt make him an authority in other fields and yet you have no problem voting someone like trump into office hawking may not be an authority in the field of existential treats but neither was einstein an authority in the field of physics when he invented special and general relativity the difference between hawking and the next administration is that neither are authorities in the field but hawking cares and thinks about the existential treats human civilization is facing while the next administration wants to accelerate the race to the end by ramping up the use of fossile fuels

space,removed,have you ever spent much time talking with a conspiracy theorist i have it doesnt matter what theory the common thread through all believers is that they are being sceptical after spending time with them i learned that scepticism is massively overvalued frankly everyone thinks theyre being the sceptical one and anyone can be sceptical of anything its easy im sceptical that rain comes from clouds ive seen rain on a cloudless day before scepticism alone is of absolutely no value whatsoever unless you use your open and unbiased mind to then rigorously and scientifically investigate the matter and come to some conclusion reviewing other peoples work is fine for us because who has time to recreate the entire field of meteorology from scratch just to figure out whether rain comes from clouds but you have to weigh whether that work has been done according to the scientific method been peer reviewed etc thats the purpose of those things but simply being sceptical because it sounds better than im ignoring the work of others because i dont like what they found is hopeless incidentally anthropogenic climate change has made it through vigorous scientific trials it came out the other side of those a long time ago

space,removed,i had to do some backing on this one a little research has made things interesting pretty quickly an ion cannon is a fictional beam weapon described as firing beams of ions atoms or molecules with an electrical charge hm i wonder we must go deeper in order to understand the full extent of this wikipedia article you ready here we go fictional – fictitious fictional a fictional character thing or event occurs in a story play or film and has never actually existed or happened i had to put myself into the position of lots of fictional characters a musical about a fictional composer called moony shapiro fictional also means relating to fiction and the telling of stories james joyces final fictional experiment was a novel composed entirely of mathematical equations fictitious something that is fictitious is false and is intended to deceive people they bought the materials under fictitious names wow just wow but we must go deeper from the article china insists its programme is for peaceful purposes but the us defense department has highlighted beijings increasing space capabilities saying it is pursuing activities aimed to prevent adversaries from using spacebased assets in a crisis incredible lets focus on whats really said here china insists its programme is for peaceful purposes but the us defense department has highlighted beijings increasing space capabilities saying it is pursuing activities aimed to prevent adversaries from using spacebased assets in a crisis do you see that wait china insists its programme is for peaceful purposes but the us defense department has highlighted beijings increasing space capabilities holy shit the us defense department guys zomg this is a sensational discovery but lets try to stay calm theres more china insists its programme is for peaceful purposes wait where did i hear that before china the last letter of china is a a is the first letter of the alphabet alphabet alphabet starts with an a coincidence lets see tebahpla tebahpla is alphabet spelled backwards backwards my reasoning is also backwards wait theres more backwards minus backwards forwards that means im making progress progress is a word similar to congress that takes us back to the united states government im starting to see a pattern the united states government has two neighboring countries mexico mexico is also peaceful does the united states government agree agree agree starts with the letter a and ends with gree that sounds like a greek the greeks are not making progress there is also no greek making in the united states government they wish wow you know who else wishes thats right donald trump does he agree with mexico lets see these dignified sources tell us to be careful for peaceful regions regions in the making of this investigation there were regions in the brain involved involved has three syllables the symbol of the illuminati has three sides china is illuminati confirmed

space,removed,oh yeah well they can vote in trump whos inferior now
space,removed,would a hairline fracture on the lower nosecone cause destruction quite likely its the most heavilyloaded area in terms of heat what about the same level of damage on the side of the body would a segment of paneling being heavily damaged on say a circular area on top of the wing cause catastrophic failure these areas are out of the airstream and have comparatively no protection they dont get heated up past the temperature on the sunlit side in orbit are the depictions of orbital elevators in the media moderately accurate specifically depictions such as halo or the more recent trailer for ace combat theyve got way too much extra stuff on them a space elevator would just barely support the weight of a lone cable and even then that would require a considerable jump in materials sciences those seen in the games are more like entire skyscrapers to orbit orbitscrapers
space,removed,ºc in non retard units
space,removed,i dont think so im not sure why but i have the impression they leak and eventually explode

space,removed,second countdown starts at
space,removed,whats the marker to the left
space,removed,i think the point he was making is that theres no proof or anything its just a bunch of speculation off what some people think things may have been like and then preach it like its absolute fact modern scientists are like the ancient priests white robes and all people just eat up whatever they say cuz theyre a scientist
space,removed,yeah its weird i see comments as tally but only see actually comments see if theyll post mine

space,removed,fake this isnt even remotely accurate because the earth is flat

space,removed,its believed that early protohumans arose in africa and migrated around the world as nomads by traveling up into what is now europe across what is now asia and into the americas via a land bridge that connected to alaska from there each evolved based on their environment so yes we all technically originated from the same place

space,removed,whats australia
space,removed,rads
space,removed,itt people not getting the point of this and instead trying to bring a political argument to the table
space,removed,sputnik sobs into corner
space,removed,good point the perspective of seeing ourselves like that is credited to a substantial shift in human consciousness although today we might as well be staring at our navels
space,removed,yes i agree hmmmm shallow and pedantic documented
space,removed,
space,removed,nothing
space,removed,so a shit storm
space,removed,sometimes all you need is a litter perspective thank you op
space,removed,really cause we all came here to check out the wall decor in your hovel and not learn about the unlocked mysteries of space well done doofus
space,removed,trump has said a lot of things when i see his wall going up i might think he wasnt lyinghis wanting to point nasa towards tha stars is his effort to prevent anyone confirming climate change which he fervently denies despite all evidence because it conflicts with hs financial aimsi realy hope he finds out that the other planets are uninhabitable before his policies fuck up this one beyond repair
space,removed,from out there on the moon international politics look so petty you want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say look at that you son of a bitch edgar mitchel apollo astronaut speaking in people magazine on april

space,removed,so cool sucks thats ill never be able to do that
space,removed,i live in vero
space,removed,no its not people do it look at ulas photo from last night its a composite of the streak and stars
space,removed,i have the technicians one hanging in my bedroom
space,removed,anybody who is saying they want to go live on the surface of mars better think about the interaction of perchlorate with the human body he warned at onehalf percent thats a huge amount very small amounts are considered toxic so youd better have a plan to deal with the poisons on the surface
space,removed,this speck of dust is an oasis for human life it is a perfect spaceship powered by nuclear energy hurtling through space at mph it is an ideal place to live people who want to leave dont realize how good we have it here youd spend two months on some barren wasteland before realizing what a terrible mistake youd made
space,removed,im pilot im fly
space,removed,hey you cant fool me i saw prometheus
space,removed,and im getting paid so i can use my moneyfor what exactly
space,removed,i hope i can see mankind walk on mars sometime during my lifetimeage
space,removed,where do i sign up
space,removed,it is more comparable with ion drives eg plasma thruster used in esas mission has roughly twice the thrust of em drive as measured by eagleworks
space,removed,humans are the only creatures on the planet that actively work against themselves at least out of the ones i know how vague of you

space,removed,i love your generosity have some gold
space,removed,uh what aerojet doesnt exclusively use motors or engines they use both thus the acquistion of rocketdyne and the long history of motors jato bottles and engines among many others
space,removed,acceleration in physics is the rate of change ofvelocity of an object with respect to time
space,removed,thanks obama
space,removed,and dumb comments like this are why i hate reddit
space,removed,isnt that the exact same concept as the alcubierre drive that nasa is toying with httpsenwikipediaorgwikialcubierredrive rather than exceeding the speed of light within a local reference frame a spacecraft would traverse distances by contracting space in front of it and expanding space behind it resulting in effective fasterthanlight travel
space,removed,there is a difference between ftl travel and arriving at the destination before light which is called apparent ftl which is what wormholes and some devices like the alcubierre drive might allow
space,removed,they didnt seem very prepared for that
space,removed,you are so fucking dumb it hurts me to read this do you have any personal evidence that anything happened before the day you were born i really hope youre trolling or else youre a symbol of the failure of the education system

space,removed,
space,removed,mars mars bitches
space,removed,because spending money to go see what we can harvest from another planet is a better idea than fixing our shit at home fuckedpriorities
space,removed,nasa made a super clickbait announcement and now everyones feeding on it
space,removed,as someone working on sls i find these comments a bit sad to read i hope people here will have a more positive opinion of sls once the first launch happens
space,removed,m a r s mars bitches red rocks
space,removed,i dont disagree with you but democrats dismantling all the nuclear power research is the reason for why humanspacetravel cannot exist without safe nuclear power you cannot have humans living in other planets you cannot have travel that far away from the sun where solar panels become exponentially less efficient every few million miles from the sun democrats did some of the most damage to human space exploration by attacking nuclear power and nextgeneration designs
space,removed,remind me
space,removed,the average cost per space shuttle launch was million the iss cost billion mostly us paid here is a chart of the percentage that nasa received of the total us budget httpsenwikipediaorgwikifilenasabudgetfederalsvg httpwwwnasagovnewsbudgetindexhtml
space,removed,m
space,removed,with near zero interest
space,removed,so preventive measures would include improved pipe insulation andor a great big vacuum next to the exhaust points to suck and redirect vented oxygen out of the area
space,removed,ive read somewhere that musk was pretty much preparing to live in his friends basement in case spacex failed at the beginning how does that fit in
space,removed,im sorry for my quotations and historical facts
space,removed,
space,removed,trump does not want more funding for nasa he even said that the goverment should leave human space travel to private companies other than that its just the usual him giving nonanswers and avoiding the question by saying that he thinks space is wonderful
space,removed,other than the fact that an mit think tank has said that youre laughably wrong where on mars is there mud to block our solar panels because if you have found mud which requires water to form then nasa would be extremely interested in talking to you

space,removed,a quick snapshot of uranus im too childish for reddit
space,removed,you should join the jupiter mining corp
space,removed,awesome thanks
space,removed,while i think that its extremely improbable that it was sabotaged especially by a sniper dont get me wrong im a huge fan of what spacex has been doing but this feels like a mental gymnastics exercise to me what if the sniper gets caught or just gets recorded on video what if the investigation team finds forensic evidence eg bullet holes in the wreckage what if a conspirator talks or makes a mistake and leaves traces the ensuing shitstorm would not be good for ula the russians or anybody else would such a clandestine operation be worth the considerable risk yes
space,removed,
space,removed,what is the explanation for the l shaped scars on the planets surface ill see if i can find a flick from the google
space,removed,i guess you just completely ignored the part where he was arbitrarily denied access ula honestly sounds like a shitty company if they would fight against competition tooth and nail even going to the extent of replacing their ceo with one who vows to fight spacex lmao
space,removed,how can we clean this and use this
space,removed,those things require power supplies and cooling the size of small trucks and would be completely unable to be hidden from the eyes of regular employees so no
space,removed,nice
space,removed,the apollo astronauts carried dosimeters to measure the radiation dosage they received while passing through the belts they recorded about rads for the entire trip you wouldnt want to be exposed to radsweek for extended periods of time but its over times below the lethal dose
space,removed,encounter what
space,removed,because reptilians and illuminati dont want to get exposed yet
space,removed,halo
space,removed,i will second this i am in the third part and have not picked it up in months i did finish some other stuff though
space,removed,i wish we had rings that would be fucking awesome
space,removed,i use to think the wow signal was that the aliens sent us a message saying wow haha
space,removed,but the earth is quite clearly flat read a book ok ok
space,removed,can we not shouldnt there be a vote on this
space,removed,is there really a momentum transfer involved if so does it depend on the inhomogeneity in distribution of mass in two bodies would it work for perfect spheres finally dont we lose some orbital energy through tidal effects
space,removed,wheres pluto is it not a planet today
space,removed,yup at this rate uranus will soon turn into a gargantuan black hole

space,removed,this is photoshopped the earth is flat not round
space,removed,no you would not
space,removed,thank you i knew i saw this somewhere else
space,removed,earth is like psst wanna buy some drugs
space,removed,hum with that username im trying to decide if you are being sarcastic or a real true believer
space,removed,achievement of what exactly becoming an astronaut is incredibly hard boy or girl you have to be ridiculously smart and fit and pretty much have to start molding yourself at age no matter who you are if you can accomplish that you have my lifelong kudos the idea behind this sexcentric stuff is that people are saying we know it was hard but you know since youre a girl its even more impressive as if simply being a man means you dont have to work as hard and therefore dont deserve as much appreciation and visaversa for women thats whats belittling to both men and women its times long past since we should have stopped paying attention to this stuff now what this article actually is is a pr move to attract more girls to the field which is totally ok given the numbers its entirely possible that there are girls out there who love space but for some reason dont think they have a chance at going there simply because theyre girls you dont need to be a sociologist to know that this is happening everywhere but once they do become astronauts they will have long since escaped that world of sexism and selfdoubt and entered the real world of equality its ridiculous to then bring them back and congratulate them for not only becoming astronauts but for also being girls if i was a girl astronaut and you said that to me id want to say well yeah but yknow bob over there worked really hard too
space,removed,can anybody tell me when this photo was taken
space,removed,how can it be a cube when it is flat
space,removed,photoshop ugh why cant we get one decent photo just one
space,removed,thats basically what it feels like posing them like that seems weird if they meant it as a joke then thatd be funny but if someone honestly posed them like this to serve a purpose then thats just sad if not bizarre one thing i always find weird about these pieces is how they always emphasize their masculine qualities like they appear to have been trying to do in the picture thats a losing battle in gender wars when youre just trying to see how much one gender can be like another since that implies the other gender is the pinnacle already hopefully we can reach a time in the future where the vast consensus to them being female or gay or anything else is so what with praise being doled out when they do something worthy of praise i also find it a little bit silly that we think of astronauts as badasses back in the day they were pilots who werent afraid of death but nowadays theyre scientists who just need to be healthy enough to survive the trip either way kick ass that they made it through
space,removed,give me a break
space,removed,perfect phone background thanks science
space,removed,the solar system is the gravitationally bound system comprising the sun and the objects that orbit it either directly or indirectly of those objects that orbit the sun directly the largest eight are the planets with the remainder being significantly smaller objects such as dwarf planets and small solar system bodies of the objects that orbit the sun indirectly the moons two are larger than the smallest planet mercury the solar system formed billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud the vast majority of the systems mass is in the sun with most of the remaining mass contained in jupiter the four smaller inner planets mercury venus earth and mars are terrestrial planets being primarily composed of rock and metal the four outer planets are giant planets being substantially more massive than the terrestrials the two largest jupiter and saturn are gas giants being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium the two outermost planets uranus and neptune are ice giants being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium called ices such as water ammonia and methane all planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic the solar system also contains smaller objects the asteroid belt which lies between the orbits of mars and jupiter mostly contains objects composed like the terrestrial planets of rock and metal beyond neptunes orbit lie the kuiper belt and scattered disc which are populations of transneptunian objects composed mostly of ices and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids within these populations are several dozen to possibly tens of thousands of objects large enough that they have been rounded by their own gravity such objects are categorized as dwarf planets identified dwarf planets include the asteroid ceres and the transneptunian objects pluto and eris in addition to these two regions various other smallbody populations including comets centaurs and interplanetary dust freely travel between regions six of the planets at least four of the dwarf planets and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites usually termed moons after the moon each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects the solar wind a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the sun creates a bubblelike region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere the heliopause is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of interstellar wind it extends out to the edge of the scattered disc the oort cloud which is thought to be the source for longperiod comets may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere the solar system is located in the orion arm lightyears from the center of the milky way
space,removed,youre not serious are you
space,removed,im a woman and i dont find it belittling i think a lot of people hear the word astronaut and they automatically picture a man in their minds even if they know logically that there have been plenty of lady astronauts most of the very famous astronauts whose names are stuck in the general publics minds are men stories like this one help to push back against that perception
space,removed,almost the earth is a cube but because there are four simultaneous days happening at once every day is completely flat its just a technicality though
space,removed,you deserve a bucket of upvotes for getting the point of that joke i thought it was too dated for reddit to get it but youve proven that some of us have either lived though history or at least paid attention in class when it was taught you get tagged as a class act so i upvote you when i see you around a thread in the future
space,removed,youve all been educated stupid
space,removed,thats because its fake look at the curve of the earth in relation to the size of italy it makes no physical sense the curve shouldnt be so prominant or italy shoulnylt be that big compared to the size of that curve think about it
space,removed,op
space,removed,its by design they put a lot of effort into making sure women get into these roles specifically so they can play it up publicly its not pandering its a show
space,removed,this is complete garbage more nasa lies for the sheeple i mean how did this supposed rocket even get into space and line up a perfect shot of earth explain that huh complete garbage
space,removed,its actually conservative in tech and they might end up with much better propulsion options to shorten the trip and artificial gravity and a few other things
space,removed,many heads of state and senators flew on the space shuttle in the to the best of my knowledge many of them are still assholes today senator jake garn bill nelson and one of the crown princes of saudi arabia the iss is not a hotel it is an experimental space vehicle while i am supportive of space tourism there are limits to what it can safely accommodate
space,removed,will the mission to mars be so big that the crew needs four cooks s
space,removed,whats that im sorry for my lack of knowledge of the matter
space,removed,excuses they havent managed anything stop pretending they want these to explode they dont want them to explode however they arent going to bother testing to the level they would with manned flight this is just a duh its how nasa does it its how everyone does it manned rockets blow up much less often because there is a lot more testing done more excuses launching is definitely not the issue for a manned mission to mars otherwise wed already have gone duh its not the only issue its just the issue most likely for a catastrophic failure the issues with getting to mars are radiation food etc sheer cost of it and all that duh there are bigger challenges than launching just saying the biggest risk moment with plans in place is the launch because well theres no time for any measures to fix anything stop sucking musky dick please im not some spacex worshiper i highly doubt they even hit the unmanned date of i personally think nasa with their new rocket will be the first to get there
space,removed,whats going on here this image was taken by the opportunity rover which after long and productive years on mars reached its final long term goal marathon valley last year marathon valley is a valley in the crater wall of endeavour crater zoom in on the image i posted at the top to get an idea of just how large endeavour crater is and then be amazed at the fact that opportunity has travelled nearly double the craters diameter in its time on mars opportunity was directed to marathon valley because the mars reconnaissance orbiter found strong evidence of clay minerals there and clay minerals mean there was once water opportunity is investigating them now
space,removed,ayy lmao
space,removed,and a camera man
space,removed,they never are
space,removed,im glad they are doing this but someone needs to do a reshoot of saturn as they cut off part of the rings
space,removed,
space,removed,aurora borealis at this time of year in this part of the country located entirely inside your kitchen
space,removed,universal a comcast company
space,removed,at quick glance i thought this said isis
space,removed,this is the most beautiful view ever
space,removed,hey man ive been there its a hard and brace thing to do wd sucks and feels like itll last forever but youll get through it congrats on getting
space,removed,any ideas on how high the temperature of the this gas is
space,removed,yep etna too to some extent
space,removed,now show me aurora as seen from isis
space,removed,its not a moon no you idiot it really is a moon
space,removed,if youre lost in the woods two options a set the woods on fire and wait or start jacking off someone will see you
space,removed,thanks d
space,removed,and you wonder why people use the term magic in days of yore
space,removed,thats no moon
space,removed,solar system
space,removed,wowits beautiful
space,removed,thats just a piece of a old rover
space,removed,relax im sure its just a branch
space,removed,yes there is an animation somewhere of what the triple landing will look like and its already bad ass a live feed will kick bad ass to the curb
space,removed,microgravity
space,removed,yep still mars
space,removed,no the scientists just programmed the rover to be a troll
space,removed,it really looks that there is some kind of animal skeleton
space,removed,i started laughing before i finished the first sentence apparently i am years old
space,removed,camping needs me to find ppl to come withim like aspie and just old enough to drinkand i know shit about surviving on my ownand im to antisocial for campingplus i dont like the wildlong stupid story shortmy best bet is an observatory
space,removed,one of the coolest things ive ever seen
space,removed,kamehameha
space,removed,dope stuff thanks for sharing here
space,removed,its so real that it looks fake
space,removed,rengineteststands
space,removed,i was saying that i was oversimplifying the entire situation which i was the point was just that fluid dynamics are crazy complicated
space,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikimidas
space,removed,is that over
space,removed,
space,removed,yeah thats what i said
space,removed,boo fine then
space,removed,that works too
space,removed,but if black holes can theoretically evaporate via hawking radiation doesnt that mean that things do escape hawking radiation is kind of a trick involving virtual particles virtual particles are weird this is a good
space,removed,it looks like a real like kamehameha
space,removed,looks like plasma
space,removed,it looks so surreal
space,removed,so it runs on a dilithium chamber leak
space,removed,so thats why its been so hot lately
space,removed,beautiful
space,removed,this looks like a real life kamehameha
space,removed,no it is europe it just looks like that now because refugees
space,removed,thought i was on thedonald and id see hillary with the kkk guy in here
space,removed,space sperm whales
space,removed,oh weird
space,removed,vehicle tracks
space,removed,europa itsa the final countdowna
space,removed,probably the size of a potato
space,removed,did you happen to read anything at all that i said it appears you did not i am not going to explain it again to you the light is deflected it does appear bent just as a pencil in water appears bent be it a glass magnifying glass or a galaxy the physics are the same it is snells law and refractive index as i have already explained to you but that light is not bent by the pull of gravity on the light it is because gravity changed the rate of change of time just like a glass changes the velocity of light gravity changes the rate of time and velocity of light relative oh i am explaining it again read my previous posts i am not going to endlessly repeat myself
space,removed,supposed to be working on space not working on space why did you need to ask that question how was it not fucking blindingly clear
space,removed,we need a submariner too
space,removed,what is the scale of this image
space,removed,looks like some sort of cell tissues looks like nature i guess
space,removed,that is so fucking beautiful
space,removed,nasa really does not want to do this mission since there is no possible spinoff to feed their manned spaceflight pork machine mars is a different story nasa has been dragging their heels on this mission for years so congress and the planetary society finally got fed up and put their foot down even then the worthless admin of nasa boldin diverted the funds to manned spaceflight crap congress got really mad and demanded this mission bolden squealed about it but had to relent then bolden pulled another trick is trying to delay the mission until let ie never in nasa terms boldin is disgraceit almost as if he is afraid of what jpl will find there ie something that overshadows his iss activities
space,removed,pretty sure those are spice worm tracks
space,removed,i can sort of make out a few things but wheres italy
space,removed,contact gravity
space,removed,matt damon is still stuck up there i never finished the movie
space,removed,nope just balls
space,removed,time for a name change or to be shut down then its far easier to insult someone who expects the fucking space organization to care about their goddamn congressional mandate than to hold intelligent discussion yeah im getting that from you apologists
space,removed,check out the europa report movie
space,removed,nooo all these worlds are ours but not that one
space,removed,this annoying comment always appears when someone talks about exploring space or wanting to see something away from earth
space,removed,i expected to see a image of hillary and the kkk member hidden in this picture somewhere
space,removed,how big is that surface area is it like the size of a city or like a meter across
space,removed,amd the people in the future will never be able to enjoy a simpler past our time is as interesting as amy and we get to be part of it no one else does ever again
space,removed,salty compounds being transported mixed by water is a key component for life ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
space,removed,camera canon telescope barlow on a orion astrograph mount orion atlas eq with dual axis drive controller processing took about frames compressed them into frames using pipp then stacked them in autostakkert and finally edited the image in registax
space,removed,it would have to take some unbelievable string of bad luck or catastrophic setbacks thermonuclear devices president trump great filter accomplished
space,removed,rash b сука
space,removed,sending things to venus is less work because the spacecraft is falling toward the sun rather than climbing away from it also venus is much more interesting than mars venus is similar size and composition to earth in fact the easiest location for human habitation off our planet right now would be floating cities in the upper atmosphere of venus you wouldnt need a pressure suit but you might wear something to protect you from acidity
space,removed,fuck that suits for
space,removed,move to a fucking major city you hillbillies
space,removed,poor little guys
space,removed,pounds not years and back in my day we had to use the computer we didnt have those fancy apps
space,removed,the only controls available to those on board were two pushbuttons on the center post of the cabin one labeled on and one labeled off the on button simply started a flight from mars the off button connected to nothing it was installed at the insistence of the martian mentalhealth experts who said that human beings were always happier with machinery they thought they could turn off
space,removed,nobody else is close
space,removed,sorry for wasting my time i hope you get better soon
space,removed,well if i was indian and needed to send a satellite id prob send too so i can have one working p
space,removed,i expected
space,removed,heres a launch video
space,removed,because who cares about how many satellites you can launch when half of your population essentially resides in shit of the time
space,removed,how can a country with so much poverty invest that much money in space exploration just to show off dont they have other priorities like i dont know building sidewalks or toilets first
space,removed,is this so they can have advanced gps navigation to the nearest designated shitting street
space,removed,but the tiangon space stations buttons are all labeled in chinese
space,removed,pfftbest korea launced satellites all at once in honour of supreme leader kim il sungs birthday on april
space,removed,what would you do with several hundred million dollars satellites at the same time
space,removed,ive recently seen a documentary about indians shitting in the streets and the ocean thanks to reddit oh ok nevermind then your entire argument is valid
space,removed,yeah it was just a question nothing implied there at all just an honest man out for the truth lol
space,removed,tell you what id do if i had a space program
space,removed,india is an astounding place advanced space program in a country where toilets are a terrifying futuristic novelty humans are odd creatures
space,removed,im italian this demonstrates that you keep making assumptions out of nothing and of course publicly shows that youre twice as dumb since youre allowed to speak at least think twice before doing it as a human being like any else on this planet im sure you have a brain its mostly a matter of using it cheers
space,removed,wont make his country richer but were all hoping it will have some kind of effect on your dumb head
space,removed,get over it
space,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikifilethesubstellarcompaniontogqlupijpg and have quite nice images as well
space,removed,yes good thing way better than clean drinking water or hell a toilet
space,removed,the first one looks like a wave
space,removed,do you want a forest fire because thats how you get forest fires
space,removed,they still shit on streets
space,removed,terrifying thank you
space,removed,knowing what goes into tracking a single nasa launch i imagined separate launches simultaneously what a nightmare only to see just a single rocket was used lame
space,removed,sol so hot right now
space,removed,thanks obama
space,removed,well the indians do have a extreme advantage with their curry fueled rockets
space,removed,yet their people are starving and they claim billions in aid seems legit
space,removed,congratulations india
space,removed,amazing now if they can figure out how to shit in a toilet theyre on the golden path
space,removed,ultimate selfie im jealous
space,removed,what sort of filters do the astronauts have to not go blind
space,removed,and then theres python
space,removed,the average iq of an africanamerican is they are either stupid because of their genetics or stupid because of socioeconomic problems but they are stupid either way
space,removed,two americans
space,removed,oh shit they found out trump got elected shits about to hit the fan
space,removed,the time traveling beings are too late the election is already over oh noooooooooo
space,removed,all of this will be accomplished by the james webb as a good guess long before this project is completed launched etcfucktards
space,removed,pluto aint a planet
space,removed,dont know if youve heard but pluto isnt a planet
space,removed,but pluto isnt a planet
space,removed,weird how venus is hotter than mercury mercury is closer to the sun til
space,removed,adama and company
space,removed,httpiimgurcomnhiziuxjpg
space,removed,but just thinking about how you could actually survive bare skinned or at least with casual attire on a completely different planet is mindblowing to me you cant survive bareskinned on mars regardless of the temperature or your amount of oxygen the atmospheric pressure is far too low
space,removed,i came her to ensure a uranus joke was made thatll do reddit thatll do
space,removed,where on this scale would be my exs heart
space,removed,i have a question please if u can but as the temps get lower and lower the futher from the sun you get is there a limit to how cold outer space can get as u leave the solar system and get as far from any sun as possible what are the average temps minus degrees seems so extreme that its hard to imagine how cold it could get and why it would be that way
space,removed,haarp is nothing more than a study of the ionosphere with possible methods of improving the relaying of radio signals which are regularly bounced off of it the idea was to use high frequency radio waves to excite the ionosphere which is as one might expect rather difficult to control and thus improve communication there is absolutely nothing sinister with this project and the scientific return was valuable and ultimately useful furthermore the link you provided directed me toward a youtube video not in any way a source of legitimate date with a title in all caps which is a childish way of communication declaring impossible technology the aircraft was obscured by clouds which showed nothing more than a typical airliner flying overhead leaving contrails behind i will not comment any more about this this is not a conspiracy subreddit
space,removed,damned belters
space,removed,fucking kelvin
space,removed,we started there now were going back
space,removed,heh uranus is cold
space,removed,i love this
space,removed,home sweet home
space,removed,dude earth is kind of a bitch compared to the other planets in our neighborhood
space,removed,planets not shown to scale somehow this was deemed necessary
space,removed,fantastic
space,removed,global warming on venus is a hoax
space,removed,i dont think we should trust this that thermometer looks broken
space,removed,pedantic
space,removed,so what if global warming happened on mars
space,removed,loose
space,removed,uranus is really really cold
space,removed,are they testing it on a barge
space,removed,thicker atmosphere
space,removed,so is pluto a planet now wtf im so confused
space,removed,i was going to say is liveable
space,removed,photoshop
space,removed,dslr
space,removed,can anyone explain why venus is hotter than mercury
space,removed,til
space,removed,take that atheists
space,removed,good starting point indeed many thanks
space,removed,im excited that they are going to start making gn particle drives in space
space,removed,if they did it right juno would proceed to fuck shit up on each of those moons turning those side hos into monsters such then in years we can send a herculesjasonperseus probe to kill them thats the long con
space,removed,almost there
space,removed,that should probably not have been allowed otherwise it may have led to this kind of situation if juno fails orbital insert we know who to blame you tom petty lookalike jesus freak
space,removed,the great red spot is approximately entire earths across
space,removed,so years later juno is finally going to catch jupiter with his mistresses that is one longass setup for a joke but its pretty damn funny nice scientists nice
space,removed,how many boys are there and are they any stupider than the rest of us here
space,removed,we should be spending more money to combat muslims and women driving on our roads
space,removed,tbf hercules is actually the roman form of heracles
space,removed,isnt hercules the roman version
space,removed,delivered with at least mistakes and unnecessary edit whoops
space,removed,i wonder why they attached the basketball court to it seems like it would create some pretty heavy friction
space,removed,when galileo discovered that jupiter had moons each was named for one of jupiters mistresses in one hour the juno spacecraft named after jupiters wife will arrive this is a joke scientists had setup over years ago
space,removed,moon moon moon and moon its like cats no use giving them names if they dont come when you call them also sound doesnt travel in space so they cant hear you anyway
space,removed,granted im already peter pan old who watches lcs matches religiously and has a personal ftb server but there are always lost boy positions open you dont have to grow up
space,removed,in order it should be brotherhood revelations desmond dies to save the world and frees juno liberation was about a hacking group trying to expose abstergo then black flag where standish is a precusor and wants you to be junos avatarhttpblogubicomwatchdogseastereggs rogue follows a different analyst for abstergo entertainment you trigger a virus while digging through turncoat assassin shay patrick cormac two templers help you repair what damage was done and youre then forced to join the templars unity is arno dorians story which is really a way for the assassins to discover the location of a known sages remains before abstergo does it ends with the whole in a million cliff hanger
space,removed,he turned io into a cow to conceal her from herajuno
space,removed,thats just the escape velocity not the maximum velocity this is sort of a lower bound for how slow it could take but not how fast
space,removed,to add to that if you want to travel a light year in roughly a generation years you would have to travel at nearly kms while nee horizons is around kms
space,removed,muphrys law strikes again
space,removed,you say this is the hardest thing nasa has ever done but i think youre forgetting about them saving matt damon from mars
space,removed,crispier glover did it in less time and saved an astronaut
space,removed,this is amazing physics and maths are amazing people are amazing
space,removed,astro not aero
space,removed,its amazing how far we have come in the universe i have a feeling that jupiter is three clicks of the mouse away from me anyway it indeed seems that people have gotten used to it i tried to talk with my girlfriend about this but she was too busy reading rworldnews while giving me the youareoverexcited look the croatian media doesnt seem to have any information on this fck it brexit happened even the terrorists have becom less interesting i blame this wikipedia age and trump ofc the internet has allowed us to be smart not intelligent but also to be lazy indifferent and ungrateful for being part of this great time beam me up scotty
space,removed,it does
space,removed,no this isnt human progress this is american progress do you know what country created nasa lol
space,removed,this is nothing special australia would have just launched it straight at jupiter why the americans have to always do things arse backwards and make the space ship fly in circles is beyond me maybe their brains are all clogged with cholesterol lol fucking idiots americans make me so angry come to australia and fight me
space,removed,wow
space,removed,out of this world even
space,removed,indeed i mean humans figured out the earth was round wayyyyy before computers came about
space,removed,get ready for all sorts of animations and cgi so exciting lmao
space,removed,was i the only one expecting a dickbutt
space,removed,poor new horizons is forgotten about in the midst too
space,removed,although the article here is talking about titan possibly having the chemical precursors for life scientists have actually been toying with the idea that life already exists on titan for more than a decade methane is unstable in titans atmosphere and is destroyed on a short time scale of about years by solar ultraviolet radiation without a constant resupply no significant amount of methane should be present in titans atmosphere however an atmospheric concentration of about is observed assuming that the resupply is provided solely biologically via reaction with no inorganic input an energy of x kj is produced over a period of million years to keep the observed methane concentration constant the free energy of the anaerobic formation of one unit carbon formula weight ucfw gmol for the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined to be kj or kjg assuming this energy demand and a generation time of year a biomass of x g at an energy conversion efficiency of would be required to keep the currently measured methane concentration at a constant level generation times for putative titan organisms are assumed here to be much longer than for average terrestrial organisms because of the slower kinetics in a colder environment if the organisms were comparable in size to typical terrestrial microorganisms with a dry mass of x g and were envisioned to homogeneously populate the upper m of the surface of titan the biomass density would be about x microbes per cubic meter a typical density for slightly nutrient deprived environments on earth
space,removed,would this move earths trajectory a tiny fraction
space,removed,ill chalk it up to the good old reddit is bad at titles youre more forgiving than i am to me it sounds like nasa is awesome but lets not forget that fat americans are gorging themselves on hot dogs and bud lite
space,removed,holy shit im so tiny
space,removed,and jacobians
space,removed,both apply
space,removed,what it took them years to make that crappy gif
space,removed,nasa will continue to be more exciting than no mans sky
space,removed,i would love for someone to photoshop the lines out arrows are fine
space,removed,thats a pretty cool place to get a tour of sweet medallions too
space,removed,i believe all of a commercial market in that orbit since operational the whole time
space,removed,was hoping for freddie
space,removed,spend my days in ultraviolet rays fun fun fun in the sun sun sun
space,removed,you know i wish mercury were made out of mercury cause thatd be really cool and probably unstable but still really cool and i think the sun would like it the sun would be like o yeah i caught a shiny planet
space,removed,found a pretty good one
space,removed,
space,removed,yea and the world would be cool except for people shooting stabbing raping and abusing people
space,removed,cool cgi
space,removed,haha i love that a cottage is the frame of reference for size were using here
space,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
space,removed,so no bruce willis ben affleck and company necessary lets all have an aerosmith sing along anyway
space,removed,kessler syndrome
space,removed,i dont know man its definitely pretty small since its only taking up a tiny portion of my computer screen unless its a cottage for ants
space,removed,
space,removed,yes broken windows but the cottage will remain more or less intact
space,removed,only one way to find out get mythbusters to drop a cottage from space
space,removed,and witches breathed a huge sigh of relief as the cottage sized asteroid zipped off into space in a mostly harmless manner
space,removed,depends on whose cottage were talking about pretty unusual unit of measurement how many bananas is that
space,removed,now all i can think of is a cottage out in space flying past the earth whitewash with blue shutters and some flowers in the window
space,removed,harry stamper doesnt know how to fail and i dooont wanna miss a thaaang
space,removed,elephants
space,removed,while investigating this asteroid should anyone encounter a small young man who refuses to answer questions i request that you contact me immediately
space,removed,they were referencing bill gates cottage
space,removed,alright men listen up the world doesnt need oil anymore so weve been commissioned to take out asteroids before they collide with earth what again thats the third time this month
space,removed,ok what would happen if it entered our atmosphere
space,removed,nasa is an overfunded waste of time duh
space,removed,cottage is not a good internationalinterincome size comparison im sure the kennedys cottages in new england make this thing look small one car garage anyone
space,removed,just like the asteroid on the
space,removed,and yet people say armageddon is stupid and could never happen s
space,removed,probably the size of a kilocottage
space,removed,meters what is the conversion to cottage
space,removed,bananas its supposed to be bananas you dolts
space,removed,check out nasas eyes on the solar system
space,removed,churchill you mean the guy who was friends with nazis even after they declared war on gb
space,removed,not really if it was heading for earth we could just hit it with a tiny rocket and that would divert its course by a huge amount
space,removed,do you have astroids no my dad does and you should hear him on the toilet in the morning
space,removed,bot for a programming class project that has gone longer than expected because folks seem to like it
space,removed,a cottage is such a random approximation of size like exactly how many refrigerators is that
space,removed,id probably be more effective if you started permabanning those people every single science thread that makes it to rall they start with the same stupid low effort jokes
space,removed,bruce willia mustve shat bricks
space,removed,for reference womp rats are not much bigger than meters
space,removed,night shift astronomer an asteroid is headed towards earth hmfic astronomer how big is it night shift its the size of a cottage hmfic or bedroom how many windows single or double level flat or peaked roof asteroid whooosh night shift never mind were good hmfic cool keep up the good work
space,removed,we could build a wall around earth and the martians will pay for it that i can tell you
space,removed,bot beep beep im all about top posts this post had upvotes and got posted to twitter and subreddit the tweet all upvotes are on and and most importantly all posts on and
space,removed,definitely borg
space,removed,is that a or a the latter being called a cottage by the upper crust of society in the early
space,removed,😂
space,removed,a cottage really i have not the slightest clue how big that would be what about meters i can relate to meters
space,removed,well now that giant meteor is over ill just vote clinton i guess
space,removed,the size of a cottage i could provide examples but cottages range in size drastically like not just a little a lot lol its like saying about the size of a lake the heck
space,removed,funny last time somebody asked how large my cottage was i said about the size of an asteroid we should really come up with a scientific way to measure things though that might come in handy
space,removed,i had to reread that like times to notice that you said cottage not cabbage
space,removed,a cottage for ants this cottage will have to be at least times as big
space,removed,for some reason my brain added cheese after the cottage i dont even like the stuff must be hungry
space,removed,it spells help in an alien language with their only source of writing material left
space,removed,too bad were not allowed to land there
space,removed,so weird this guy doesnt have a neck
space,removed,i remember a post on rwtf back before they implemented the gore rule a man in japan who had been exposed to a fatal dose of neutron radiation was kept alive for days by the end his chromosomes were so badly damaged that they were unrecognizable his body was in pretty much the same condition as they were with no skin and very little muscle still hanging off of his bones if i get stuck on any of the moons of jupiter by some horrible miracle i just going to take off my helmet
space,removed,heh looks like a cracked window to me
space,removed,id go plazy in that crace
space,removed,that would spook the fuck out of me for real lol
space,removed,there are no pictures of the milky way
space,removed,when was phil collins in space
space,removed,miles per hour theyd be dead if that were true
space,removed,whats the real duration of this
space,removed,wat
space,removed,weird i would have thought it would be a circle
space,removed,this could all be bullshit but as i dont know i will choose to believe you
space,removed,k thanks
space,removed,the term is called semantic satiation and i experienced it too reading your comment lol
space,removed,does a photon slow down when it hits something
space,removed,i just dont understand how you can proclaim one way or another what humans are capable of can you run mph its not a matter of what we are capable of technologically but what we are capable of organically you just know how to catch a ball you dont need to do physics or build an industrial complex to do that
space,removed,this thread makes my head hurt
space,removed,and thered still be that one guy wearing shorts
space,removed,pepe oo
space,removed,oh yea well my girlfriend still liked my gold rose
space,removed,am i the only one that was trying to clean the windshield
space,removed,holy
space,removed,ha these are amaze great idea
space,removed,how long will humans be around how long until earth is destroyed better to leave asap and get there second or last than not get there at all
space,removed,no my point is that discovery is not the sole motivation behind space exploration also there are a lot of people who simply are not selfish people they do stuff not because their the first to do it but because they have an idea that they want to do something about
space,removed,i see pizza
space,removed,thanks better get the word out its all over folks seriously though theres not one destination theres literally hundreds of billions and thats just within our own galaxy also the first target wont be one thats far away like the center of the milky way it makes no sense to do that you start close and expand outward
space,removed,no one can ignore the universe
space,removed,raliens
space,removed,awesome
space,removed,i see
space,removed,got my picnic location picked out
space,removed,i missed my one chance of seeing it in
space,removed,its very cold in this pluto place
space,removed,closeup of unknown objects
space,removed,are you going to tell the jupiterians that its okay to shoot each kinda like how the native americans were told its okay to shoot each u did give yourselves the privilage to kill each other lets spread the second amendment usa across the universe ya already trying to have earth live by the second i hope the second doesnt make it out of this planet
space,removed,yes science httpwwwicrorgarticlestarsnewplanets please dont fall under the spell of religion always think for yourself

space,removed,what are we supposed to do with this information i watched it happen as did millions of others the data has been analyzed conclusions have been made that are satisfactory and we lost seven people that day it was a loss and it certainly was a shock to all the school children watching to see the teacher blown out of the sky but it was no more of a loss than that child shot in ohio this week or the bombs that dropped on hospitals in our war of the week americans love their heroes and theyll take them from anywhere they can get them but it was a shitty ship that took lives over flights to nowhere it didnt do much more than put on a show cost an incredible amount of money for each turnaround and did nothing a safer vehicle couldnt have done other than the service missions to hubble was it worth it america
space,removed,im pretty sure i had this marble
space,removed,thats deader than all the good guys from rogue one at the end of the movie
space,removed,so desolate
space,removed,they were designed to be cheaper than nonreusable rockets but they ended up costing a lot more and being more dangerous since there is no launch escape system i think they were somewhat useful for building the iss but now there is no reason to use them might as well just ride the soyez and save money
space,removed,it probably helps that the shuttle isnt in their view part of why i find driving through tumbles is the claustrophobia that comes with having my view blocked by the walls and ceiling i also hate driving past those concrete walls they put up around construction
space,removed,nice a gulf ball with blue and brown spots on it
space,removed,dont empty open inside
space,removed,i think this is more of a satellites view
space,removed,sometimes i wonder if the naive would just travel a little more see the world if only for a
space,removed,dat plane is thicc
space,removed,
space,removed,hindenburg
space,removed,check out those boosters
space,removed,fun fact if you drove your average family car at motorway cruising speeds it would take almost a week of nonstop driving to reach mars

space,removed,when and where was a saturn ever used
space,removed,it is at that moment you need to ask yourself a very important question are we in the beginning of a super hero movie or a horror movie
space,removed,thats how the dinosaurs felt about the largest meteor that landed on earth before they all died
space,removed,how can we know its a meteorite if we just found it
space,removed,wow this thing must be worth an absolute fortune lets make daggers out of it
space,removed,anybody else disappointed they didnt find it in a cave with blue apes
space,removed,the size of the thing must have been really surprising to them
space,removed,they break it open and theres an interstellar virus lying dormant that turns us all into zambies
space,removed,enter the earths atmosphere they said
space,removed,well it aint a meteor thats a big ol frozen chunk of poopy we call them boeing bombs you see the peanut dead give away thats a space peanut dude you were eating off it
space,removed,looks like the meteor joe dirt found
space,removed,what if im in space and i touch it then i need to take a leak does my piss become meteor
space,removed,i mean it came from space many rich dudes would pay a pretty penny for something that came from space to increase their odds of getting their dick sucked
space,removed,im calling it now that eggmeteorite is gonna break open soon and release lavos an arbiter of doom from beyond hellbent on eradicating humankind
space,removed,wait you think humans were still living in caves years ago who fucked up your education system and got away with it writing was invented years ago and in bc we already had big cities with ten of thousands of people inside the most famous being memphis and ur and babylon shortly after when the population went up to

space,removed,what gets me is the concept that the photons of light that are reaching the telescope or our eyes actually started their journey some metric fuck ton amount of light years ago and the damn thing im seeing may not even actually be there and hasnt been for a shit long time
space,removed,let me give you some figures to understand just how insane this is okay im just an idiot hs graduate and nothing more so take what i know with a grain of salt but to my understanding so if you compress an object down to a certain level if eventually becomes a black hole that certain level is insane the entire earth would have to be compressed down to the size of a peanut im pretty sure the way it works is that at a certain point the force of gravity strongly overcomes all other forces and it kind becomes a feedback loop where gravity between gravity and density or something of that nature anyway black hole is the result every object in existence if compressed to a certain size will turn into a black hole this certain size is dubbed the schwartzchild radius check my spelling heres whats freakin crazy okay so that schwartzchild radius of an object is pretty much what the size of the event horizon of the resulting black hole is gonna be so for a black hole created from earth youd end up with a black hole the size of a peanut a black hole still only has the gravitational properties of what made it im pretty sure so the insane thing is imagine that this peanutsized object has earths same gravitational pull at a distance think of this if earth was turned into a black hole right this moment nothing would change about the moon orbiting it or anything else the moon would continue to orbitaround an object the size of a peanut i dunno how big a black hole the sun would make but i imagine something the size of a city block or something imagine how many peanuts you can fit into a city block thats just how many times bigger than the earth the sun is noowwwwwww look at that huge ass black hole wayyyy bigger than our solar system i want you to just imagine how much matter was eaten by that thing for it to exist

space,removed,i guess that is what happens when you put women niggers and a gook in a spaceship
space,removed,they are still alive look it up flat earth is real the moon landings are fake

space,removed,its a french word though so theres not much point in debating english pronunciation you dont exempt a word from having a proper english pronunciation just because it has a french cognate thats like saying theres no point debating the english pronunciation of air parachute science pardon exact accent instinct moral banquet correct or statue its a french word and an english word of english words were originally french words there is still a correct english pronunciation for every one of them whether it matches the french pronunciation or not

space,removed,the planet uranus isnt orbiting quite how newtons laws say it should orbit sometimes its going a bit faster sometimes its going a bit slower maybe theres another big planet orbiting out beyond it and its gravity is tugging on uranus as it approaches and recedes relative to it here ive worked out the numbers this is where we should look for something like that in the sky yeah right laverrier no telescope time for you thats a waste of money just tweak newtons laws until they say uranus is supposed to do that i dont care how complex you have to make them we cant make up imaginary new dark planets and pretend theyre real

space,removed,humanity will orbit more than one star hopefully that might be setting the bar low but stars are far im not convinced ftl is even possible but even if it is i doubt well figure it out in the next years which leaves only stl travel options i dont think well seriously consider building a ship which is capable of making it to another star and creating a thriving colony within the next years theres plenty of exciting stuff still to do around our star thered have to be a great desire involved to build something of that nature be it economic political or religious once we did i think itd take a years to build it a skyscraper sized chunk of deuterium with fusion reactor thrusters and a small town of people attached to it but within yearswe will hopefully have set up some colonies on planets orbiting stars that are relatively nearby within ly

space,removed,alien landing spot confirmed plot twist we are the aliens
space,removed,oddlysatisfying
space,removed,did you just call something said by a human who flew to the moon bullshit
space,removed,thought that was the planes shadow for a moment
space,removed,quarters
space,removed,fuck you just ruined the entire movie for me
space,removed,
space,removed,nopealiens did it s
space,removed,no its a geologic dome
space,removed,well that is a face
space,removed,all i see is a droplet of water in a lake
space,removed,finally its aliens
space,removed,im gonna buy so many
space,removed,thats a really nice view of uranus
space,removed,you mean the forever usa stamp of earth is centered on mexico thats it im switching my vote to trump s
space,removed,well is a photo of eris is makemake so add those any photo of a nonatmospheric planet is showing the surface eventually be prepared to learn the names of hundreds of spherical objects unless you do the sensible thing and make a size limit
space,removed,why because it has pictures of planets on it what are you fucking
space,removed,its smaller than most large moons so is mercury its orbit is full of other bodies and its a binary system which only strengthens the case it rounded itself with its own gravity and has more moons than the rest of the sol system combined and astronomers started finding a lot of other objects around the same size why are astronomers qualified to determine what is and is not a planet the reason tombaugh found it is because pluto was affecting the orbits of uranus and neptune now if pluto is so inadequate how was it discoverable years ago while all the other objects in its orbit were not the answer is really very simple pluto is a planet the international astronomical union is a group of selfappointed politicians who are looking for publicity and a way to trample on the reputation of one of the greatest americans who ever lived
space,removed,this could point to the possibility of an underground ocean also im curious about plate tectonics is the reason there is none on mars because its core has cooled
space,removed,then the solar system should have many many planets its possible that there are hundreds of dwarf planets in our solar system including the asteroid belt which the biggest one eris was found its bigger than pluto should we continue classifying these as planets this is why i stopped being a crybaby about the new classification hundreds of planets when there are eight very large bodies in the solar system that should remain labeled classically if you want to campaign for pluto to be a planet not a dwarf planet then you need to campaign for them all
space,removed,billion suns holy shit
space,removed,this is absolutely terrifying
space,removed,cause its cool but its not launching real missions and landing the first stage its bezos being a bigger loser than he already is i love the reusability and the fact that private space companies are gonna unlock the solar system thanks to initial govt investment but its not that exciting relatively to what else is going on and stamps rock
space,removed,and yet it is incrediblyin
space,removed,arrakis
space,removed,am i the only person on reddit that has seen a funny thing happened on the way to the moon i mean the documentary basically completely debunks the official apollo story why is everyone drinking nasas kool aid watch the film watch the press conference with aldrin armstrong and collins watch their body language listen to their responses watch it with an open mind and then tell me that you still believe those three landed on the moon
space,removed,if anything here is disgraceful its you can we not have a story about women or does literally everything have to be about men
space,removed,sitting there wondering if its colorized or true color and then he spills it out nasa and their black and white camera give me higher chances of getting cancer lets get our own satellite camera with true colors on the same orbit how much did the mission cost we can slash the cost by sending it from india
space,removed,no we do not we know what it is but what causes it initially is still a mystery while on the topic even things like thunderstorms and tornadogensis is pretty poorly understood which is why it makes predicting storms so difficult point being when the weatherman fucks up a forecast dont be an asshole about it the science behind weather is still unknown to some degree and predicting something we dont fully understand is rather difficult
space,removed,maybe we cant see the other side of the galaxy
space,removed,in order to have any effect at all the astronomicalsize claw that takes a hold of the planet would probably crush its thin crust and cause planetwide earthquakes and tidal waves volcanic eruptions and clouds of dust resulting in a global winter and the extinction of most species have a nice day
space,removed,heard that like times
space,removed,one light year is kilometers its to mars and it estimated to be about months to travel from earth to mars bad math time time to travel one light year based on mars travel time calculation light year distance to mars months or years that means at our current rate of travel it would take years to make it light years

space,removed,no years isnt impossible lol travelling that fast is what is impossible

space,removed,i keep a copy of protector and ringworld in my car to read during my lunchdowntime i could reread niven a hundred times and still enjoy it
space,removed,the immortality machine is something i talk about with people on a regular basis and no i havent my father has mentioned it to me a few times but i always forget to check bookstores for it when im rummaging around for good reads ill def have to check it out now though
space,removed,im thinking the fithp that drove the thuktun flishithy that close to a ring is going to be in trouble
space,removed,yeah shouldnt have taken off his helmet
space,removed,it is a big bootstrap paradox which is not at all uncommon in time travel movies i dont know why you think he made the wormhole though i didnt see any evidence that he was the others the others made the wormhole and tesseract cooper sent the coordinates to nasa to himself bootstrap paradox and the evolved humans the others created a wormhole to save the humans of earth bootstrap paradox
space,removed,are you a heinlein fan if so look at the book that was written by spider robinson from a detailed outline by heinlein its called variable star and robinson had heinleins name appear above his own its not quite heinlein but has a very heinlein vibe
space,removed,because both are entertaining
space,removed,reminds me a lot of httpmultivaxcomlastquestionhtml by issac asimov
space,removed,and in such a universe its possible that loops could exist presentday humanity gets saved by time travelers future humans send timetravelers back the reason it seems paradoxical is that we imagine that the future humans could choose not to send someone back but obviously they would not actually have that choice if this happened maybe humanity would learn something about our sense of free will or perhaps more likely peoples brains would simply come up with explanations after the fact to allow them to continue feeling like they are in control there is already real evidence suggesting that this is the case it still seems like a bizarre situation but every action has a cause and no physical laws are violated assuming time travel is allowed it could be just the way it is
space,removed,actually this exact type of scenario happens in the httpsenwikipediaorgwikihyperionsimmonsnovel series
space,removed,the taken king he has arrived you killed his son and invoked the wrath of a god
space,removed,i wouldnt the community has gone down the toilet many people have left and the game itself is super repetitive after hours the only reason why i played for so long is because of good friends in the game
space,removed,yeah this was my interpretation too maybe the embryos develop but the world is a ticking time bomb so they get to the point where theyre years into a new society but they need more humans to survive whatevers coming so they rewrite it so more humans make it to the planet to fix the problem

space,removed,reddit has gone to shit this thread consists almost entirely of references that mostly only other redditors would get slight variations on the same jokes and puns repeatedly posted and repeatedly upvoted words strung together into banal utterances that add absolutely no value to any conversation and completely wrong answers from people who think or pretend to know what they are talking about but actually have no idea what they are talking about often ignorant of their own ignorance i have seen others complain in other subreddits about the same thing and what they say is true the overwhelming noise drowns out the meagre signal until the signal is lost and all there is is selfsatisfied noise
space,removed,tyler said he is watching interstellar right now and you go and spoil that plot point wow uncool s
space,removed,this is the first thing i thought of
space,removed,not quite but dont worry has it covered
space,removed,i havent read the story but it just depends on how the author depicts the spaceships some we could disprove at this point and others not if its a small craft for a couple people then they could reasonably hide behind orbiting rocks a huge mothership housing a fleet we probably would have a clue of by now

space,removed,our mining operations had spread far into the outer rings deeper than ever before dwarven cargo ships were streaming back and forth to the innermoons their holds full of iron platinum nickel cobalt and mithril the elusive alloy only found in the depths of the rarest asteroids ore was sent out and the wealth of the solar system streamed in our palaces on enceladus and rhea were wonders to behold the mines of titan once an industrial town had become a sprawling subterranean megalopolis like no other before or since our civilization was set to overtake that of our fathers the human then everything changed the day the goblin nation attacked

space,removed,dibs on the dreadnaught its mine called it although if anybody wants to help me move out the previous tenants you can have your pick of the left overs also pizza
space,removed,well are we assuming a universe or multiverse if humans got to the point where they were manipulating time and extra spacial dimensions in a multiverse maybe they were saving that perticular version of humanity so they could preserve an entire universe of humans and unite with them transdimensionally thus expanding the future multidimensional human population and increasing their collective processing power to generate new ideas or saveseed more parallel universes in an expansion across all reality if this happens in a nonmultiverse then i guess future humans have to save past humans because it happenned and therefore must happen otherwise it couldnt have happenned and it wouldnt have

space,removed,literally just got done talking about this with some friends while at a my friends and i have a theory about scifi flicks being released with plots pertaining to disclosure and private sector space tech see some of these ideas in major movies are remarkably well thought out albeit a bit too well thought out if disclosure and hey weve got time travel and wormholes figured out were simply press released to the world mass panic and another cold waresque arms race would likely ensue and lets just disregard the religious implications if you can condition the general public to believe in these advancements through entertainment mediums you can effectively numb their initial shock and suppress their possible outrage by the time you unveil these advancements you have been slowly introducing new technology and the realm of acceptance to this new information suddenly becomes fathomable ive got this crazy powerful computer phone my grid power can now be solar generated and you can throw some metal into the sky to regulate weather think about this roswell happened in and was apparently just a balloon since then well documented sightings have been reported investigated and released to the public by major nations we have youtube videos of strange events and flying objects now being uploaded by numerous eye witnesses and even mainstream media reporting on them across the globe mk ultra turned out to be real tin foilers were right and we weaponized thermonuclear power in the am i supposed to believe roswell was fake after all the other lies and coverups that have been exposed assuming roswell was indeed an et craft weve had years with alien tech to reverse engineer and harness whatever bat shit crazy stuff was onboard maybe this interstellar wormhole is real maybe it was an alien craft with a drunk driver its probably just an asteroid shaking things up with saturns rings i just hope battlefield earth doesnt turn out to be one of the movies prepping me for the future it sure as hell would explain why hollywood is so fanatical about scientology now at an

space,removed,what does this mean
space,removed,i dont understand why so many people in here are pretending to shit their pants a celestial object disturbed a portion of ring as it passed too close ooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bbviously its fucking aliens
space,removed,its an unsourced wikipedia claim and no other site claims the same thing so as good as yours better even more eyes have viewed and corrected wikipedia also no other site really youve been to every site on the internet and checked and where did i say future stations will only have one port it was the only reason i could think of that would prompt your provides no place to dock comment as long as youve got a place to dock the next ship who cares if a given module has no place to dock

space,removed,born too late to explore earth why is that have you traveled the globe already have you seen it for yourself this world has so much to offer you could spend a lifetime traveling and youd still never experience all of it i wanna explore the space damn it im afraid we are still many years away from that it seems our bodies were not made for space travel were going to need to figure out how to live in space for extended periods of time before we can even think about traveling

space,removed,what about a regular elevator that goes to space so like a space regular elevator
space,removed,rlewronggeneration
space,removed,this is why im more interested in things like httpsenwikipediaorgwikistartram over space elevators a generation system is something we can mostly do with existing technology
space,removed,that scene in odst youre referring to in halo you actually play as arbiter and cut the space elevator yourself and free fall with it odst is just a different perspective of the time between halo and
space,removed,i for one appreciate it
space,removed,the formula in the video is for a cable that becomes bigger as it gets further away from earth what about other structures for example one could make a big ball of dirt with a sufficiently big radius and gravity alone would be enough to hold it together this does not really work as a space elevator because to escape that much mass it would have to be larger but at least it proves that big structures arent impossible
space,removed,then we can use it in mars

space,removed,have you heard of the space fountain its a structure kept aloft by firing huge pellets into space and collecting them back as they fall as long as youve got a shitton of energy to keep firing the pellets it can get you to space and it doesnt require ridiculous tensile strengths but does fall apart if energy is interrupted
space,removed,no if you calculate even a perfect cnt it wont work and then there isnt some magical undiscovered cnt that might change that the worst technophiles are the wishful thinkers who are disconnected from basic science
space,removed,even if we build it some muslim will fly a plane into it and all will be for naught
space,removed,how many sepratrons did they use
space,removed,this is smokescreen nasa is attempting to conceal massive evidence of life and past civilizations on planet mars read on a photographed in gusev crater on mars by nasas spirit rover in shows a robed figure wearing a crown that he could pass for a modern man turns charles darwins httpliteratureorgauthorsdarwincharlesthedescentofman on its head as well it refutes adam and eve and the notion men evolved from ethiopian ape brutes opportunity rover landing site sol nov opportunity sol nov curiosity sol oct curiosity sol dec opportunity sol oct opportunity sol aug opportunity sol oct curiosity sol may sources httpmarsnasagovmergalleryall as well as the nasa rover shots show building foundations stonework vitrified stone walls and stone and steel weapons curiosity rover landed in gale crater which is three miles deep and one hundred mi across which means the impact that formed the crater displaced some cubic miles of volcanic ash to reveal an ancient surface that is in large part intact the that covers much of mars surface came from successive eruptions of volcanoes on the httpsenwikipediaorgwikitharsis which are said to have occurred between billion and million yrs ago wiki the classical civilization that produced the statues and built the predated the tharsis eruptions which enlarges the evolutionary time frame out of sight as well it adds the dimension of space travel
space,removed,what youve brought me is worth one quarter portions
space,removed,i regret nothiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnngggggg
space,removed,not sure what that has to do with getting a cool username wouldnt that just make it more rare anyway
space,removed,lol the buran was the failed bootleg space shuttle
space,removed,the universe will probably do until we find another one
space,removed,here you can browse httparchivesesacesaintehsthome archive containing all the images before they were photoshopped hubble telescope is not just nasa mission its joint nasaesa type in the name of an object you are looking for and browse through images keep in mind that these are negatives and will require a lot of processing in order to get anything that looks decent
space,removed,if you stand close you see this
space,removed,the quality is freaking unbelievable
space,removed,tldr really big
space,removed,im already a member lmao
space,removed,thank goodness so we can indeed plug this black hole with donald trumps ego
space,removed,shock
space,removed,that is insane
space,removed,murph
space,removed,supermassive
space,removed,its really hard trying to comprehend billion suns
space,removed,what surprises me most is that considering the number of times the video has been posted in hq video this inferior gif gets upvotes when posted by a karma whore
space,removed,like kim kardashians ass
space,removed,im scared now
space,removed,jesus h christ that thing is friggin ginormous its almost as huge as ops mom
space,removed,this is nothing compared to my ex girlfriends super massive black hole aka her vagina
space,removed,and dicks out
space,removed,but still not as fat as your mom what you expected me to be polite in a thread started by pmmeyourtitsgirl what are you mental
space,removed,i was hoping to see picture of your mom towering over the black hole in the end
space,removed,i was distracted by your name
space,removed,soon radar men from the moon will be a documentary
space,removed,its actually that large
space,removed,space is really really big
space,removed,it doesnt need one until another one is discovered then itll need one so we can tell the difference
space,removed,every graphicgifvideo i have ever seen like this really doesnt help comprehend anything because you lose the scale very quickly when you keep adjusting up and up and up there is no reference point about all you can really comprehend is bigger than i can comprehend
space,removed,anyone want cheeto puffs now
space,removed,it should be noted that the plane of the solar system where the planets orbit lies at roughly a degree angle compared to the milky way so the math isnt quite as is easy as xy but the sentiment of that statement is correct
space,removed,that visualization was amazing
space,removed,so how many your moms is that
space,removed,thats nice but sweden will have to take it apart in years because it will be an affront to allah and the teachings in the koran
space,removed,august
space,removed,apollo cmp al worden took this photo of a crescent earth rising beyond the moons barren horizon on august composite of and
space,removed,radiation is easy to avoid solar radiation doesnt penetrate too deep and any decent colony is going to need fresh water water soil and whatever version of mars concrete we devise all make great barriers underground colonies would probably be the easiest though require large equipment water shielding wouldnt be too hard considering lower gravity and any concrete structures think roofs we make can be thicker due to lower gravity im not saying its easy or super practical and i am by no means an expert at all but if i can think of these i bet its not going to be that big of an issue even just piling sand on top would be quite easy again lower gravity however i do wonder how lower gravity will affect concrete hardening and strength
space,removed,why cant i use something like that to power my home
space,removed,atomic batteries to power turbines to speed roger ready to move out
space,removed,thought my monitor was dirty plus this really depends on the reference frame if you want to be pedantic
space,removed,small meteorites hit the earth on a regular basis
space,removed,that explains why im so sick right now
space,removed,i dont think so martians use a completely different data format additionally they have an exclusive contract with comcast already no way nasa is getting a piece of that pie
space,removed,the only oddessy in my mind
space,removed,remindme days
space,removed,a macro view of pointlessness nihilism confirmed
space,removed,right at the beginning of the article the new system called delaydisruption tolerant networking dtn provides a smart solution to interrupted connections and lays the groundwork for solar systemwide internet connectivity in the notsodistant future the speed of light is too slow for what you know as the internet netflix reddit google etc however the internet is lower level than that put a small datacenter on the surface of mars with a highbandwidth highly faulttolerant internet connection to earth and you could have lightweight versions of netflix reddit etc all of the content would be minutes old though depending on the alignment of the planets
space,removed,i dont think it will be long delays if they use relay systems to keep the signal strong that should lessen the delays who knows though this all seems like some kinda hoodoo magic
space,removed,except europa
space,removed,just like an rtg radioisotope thermoelectric generator
space,removed,the last mile problem is a tough one itll be just as hard to solve it on mars as it is to solve it here on earth getting data across the void is easy its getting it across rugged lumps of matter thats the tricky part we use fiber optic cables for that which we need to bury and digging holes is expensive
space,removed,the article is somewhat fluffy but the tech is real and important dtn is a significant improvement over ip for highlatency highloss data transfer the final polished result would look a lot like a cdn but that doesnt mean that the work is done lots ram to just cache files locally i think you mean persistent storage
space,removed,we dont need wires now theyre just really helpful a lot of the time
space,removed,actually its like a truck the vast majority dont need it but some always will and while they could be replaced with helicopters itd be a hell of a lot more expensive
space,removed,indeed it is that sounds like a fun technical problem to solve
space,removed,ban aggregators and shitty repost blogs reddit
space,removed,wouldnt that be outernet
space,removed,lag still killed me in csgo
space,removed,how about just my living room
space,removed,white men had the audacity to walk their white feet upon the surface of the moon only white feet have walked upon the surface of the moon i think about that every single time i look upon the moon at night white men took one small step for man and one giant leap for mankind
space,removed,even though i know its not this looks so fake
space,removed,cant i just be proud of the accomplishments of the white race the same way that blacks are proud of being black and asians are proud of asian accomplishments is it wrong to be proud of the white races space accomplishments is that racist
space,removed,is that really being inclusive to put down and criticize the accomplishments of the white race is that what you consider to be diverse anti white
space,removed,being proud of my races space accomplishments is looney is it racist to say congratulations to china for their space efforts if this was a thread about a chinese space mission instead of a white space mission and i said good job chinese or i said i am proud to be chinese would that be racist or is it only when whites do it that it is looney
space,removed,is it wrong to say that i am proud of white science and white space exploration are you literally telling me that it is only racist to be proud of white accomplishments but other races can be proud of their races accomplishments
space,removed,so i cannot be proud of white accomplishments where did you learn this modern day leftist college is literally teaching you that only white people are not allowed to be proud of their races accomplishments
space,removed,but didnt blacks in africa have a head start upon whites in america for literally tens of thousands of years shouldnt they be ahead of all the other races with more time to develop society and advance science i do not understand at all
space,removed,very very slim odds
space,removed,but why does that only apply to white people black history month latino pride asian pride but when whites and only whites do it we are racist
space,removed,but who was camera
space,removed,probably dark adaptation
space,removed,to think this all revolves around me
space,removed,sorry
space,removed,upvote for elite
space,removed,oh my universal supreme being
space,removed,ahh makes sense thanks
space,removed,no
space,removed,is there other types of cmes
space,removed,is that a real picture
space,removed,someone best described elitedangerous as a mile wide but an inch deep meaning its big but there is little depth or content
space,removed,pictured what my ass felt like this morning
space,removed,wtf when did telescope technology get this good last giant flare pictures i remember seeing were like low res and just showed a small trail coming from the sun in bw lol
space,removed,cringe riamverysmart
space,removed,and here i thought race didnt matter anymore
space,removed,i for one welcome our new solar overlords
space,removed,fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuck
space,removed,incredible picture thanks
space,removed,space cum
space,removed,it was that moment that i decided i had no further desire in trying to gain social capital with any of these people riamverysmart
space,removed,sounds dirty
space,removed,i havent seen than many black holes since the last nsfw reddit thread
space,removed,hey sorry to interrupt im at karma can u just give me a upvote and make it i have ocd and its bothering me
space,removed,how do they determine the level of water
space,removed,id imagine less erosion
space,removed,wow you have flying machines and space ships and why are you so obsessed with that tiny rectangular obj it has cats on it
space,removed,so earth basically got it
space,removed,those are some serious potholes
space,removed,and trees
space,removed,kinda looks like the death star
space,removed,excellent thanks
space,removed,rjupiterporn
space,removed,
space,removed,i swear you straight made all that up lol
space,removed,heres a tldr the approximate maximum height of an eruption column is given by the equation h where k is a constant that depends on various properties such as atmospheric conditionsm is the mass eruption rateδt is the difference in temperature between the erupting magma and the surrounding atmosphere
space,removed,not caused
space,removed,thats assuming that these hypothetical aliens havent figured out how to easily generate this amount of energy i mean yeah most likely just a mundane signal but i dont think that if there were aliens sending boopings that we should assume that its a big deal for them to send the boopings is it extremely unlikely that its aliens yup but its still easy to justify if it were theyd probably send a more steady signal to us if they were trying to make contact though maybe if theyre booping us with a strong signal theyre not trying to communicate maybe if theyre booping us with a strong signal their scanning us something like sonar
space,removed,heads up everyone this photo is fake pluto is at least twice this distance from earth
space,removed,i think you mean the year
space,removed,pussy americans no space faring material
space,removed,if they did then it was more than likely a signal for dinosaurs because of the whole speed of light thing
space,removed,
space,removed,so thats a mushroom sitting on oz right
space,removed,i expect obama will shut down seti again just like the last time we had a strong signal i doubt he expected hed have to do it twice
space,removed,australia is a dwarf continent
space,removed,this is awesome thanks for the new phone wallpaper
space,removed,those damn communists we need to build a wall and make mexico pay for it s
space,removed,used to be fucking fight me
space,removed,big bang
space,removed,is aliens real
space,removed,a dingo ayte my bay bay
space,removed,hello everyone if you require the service of a professional hacker to help track your partners cell phone remotely contact he was excellent in helping me hack my husbands phone without physical contact you can also reach him on tell him stacey referred you
space,removed,i dont care i still see it as a planet
space,removed,so does this mean australia is no longer a continent
space,removed,light years thats some lag

space,removed,impressive work
space,removed,installing windows your rover may restart several times this might take awhile 🔄 complete
space,removed,this photo
space,removed,that nebula is large and outta sight thanks to the power of clap dynomite
space,removed,i think its so incredible that jj walker has taken such a dynomite photo
space,removed,everyones walking around capturing pokemons meanwhile this guy captures an interstellar gas cloud showoff
space,removed,jw with the space ace
space,removed,i was expecting to come in here and be the only one to say dynomite and get some karma from all us old fucks i hate kids and their damn intranets stick to your pokeball references not everything is yours kids
space,removed,dynomiiiite
space,removed,thanks obama and here i thought it was more senator shelbys fault for perpetually driving more money into sls and his district than nasa has asked for leaving jack shit for other programs sls jwst have done a fantastic job of eating nasas lunch itll be interesting to see where the money goes once jwst is in service and sls has been canceled
space,removed,so about the same
space,removed,til humans are more water than europa
space,removed,dynomite
space,removed,incredible
space,removed,white house government after they disavow their fuckup they then propose more government to fix what government fucked and people vote for it because their brains are fucked its all just fucked
space,removed,that is sooooo beautiful
space,removed,
space,removed,so does it actually look this bright and colorful
space,removed,cant wait till pictures are taken theyre gonna be amazing
space,removed,hopefully investigators and engineers focused on the outer two planets are working toward resolving these issues and hopefully some day soon be able to get an orbiter proposal passed you and me both great post
space,removed,all these worlds are yours except europa attempt no landing there
space,removed,thanks for the new wallpaper
space,removed,you and i think alike
space,removed,what is the chemical composition of the local giant planets gas giants jupiter saturn are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium ice giants uranus neptune are composed mainly of heavier elements like oxygen carbon and nitrogen i would like to know what percentage of the volume of each planet is what element provides the answer on page for earth venus and mercury im interested similar data for jupiter saturn uranus and neptune i can readily find the composition of the atmospheres eg saturns atmosphere is hydrogen helium other but not for the deeper levels or the cores eg how much of the whole of saturn is hydrogen obviously any documented percentages would be best approximations with certain margins of error but i have been unable to find even that much outside of atmospheres only vague statements of mostly i suspect that what i ask is simply unknown but if you do have a concrete answer then please provide a citation thank you for your time
space,removed,no problem guy p
space,removed,appreciated
space,removed,is this where juish santa lives
space,removed,this is completely and utterly incorrect stop spreading misinformation
space,removed,thats a lot of coma aberration there that telescope need some alignment
space,removed,great work nasa
space,removed,what an incredible picture by the way commenters some of you are shadowbanned
space,removed,lol this is why this shit has points
space,removed,i mean we are on rspace
space,removed,no thats hoth
space,removed,mah man
space,removed,so basically planet hoth it seems where are the tauntauns hiding i wonder
space,removed,how long does it take for surface to rid itself of impact creaters
space,removed,the cassini mission is so mind blowing when i see stuff like this
space,removed,yeah a boeing needs a km runway so i guess youre unlikely to find a km natural runway on mars lol otoh there could be ways to decrease mass increase lift especially when flying in groundeffect increase deceleration or make the payload decelerate more rapidly than the crew doesnt mean wings and parachutes dont work they just have to be bigger theres also less stress on them so its easier to make them bigger not trying to argue with you just saying that theres often more than one way to theoretically design something
space,removed,its well known that the extensive civilization in question existed a long time ago in a galaxy far far away
space,removed,now i want a space doggo
space,removed,soyuz isnt a shuttle its singleuse the httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiburanspacecraft is the russian equivalent to the space shuttle
space,removed,picture has to be fake dogs dont like black people and black people dont go to space
space,removed,you wanna go outside
space,removed,read the article
space,removed,this is all that will be left of earth once comrade hillary ascends the throne and forces russia to destroy the planet
space,removed,fun fact when cowenia goddess of cows added a drop of milk from her udder into this concoction she created the milky way with all life inside as we know it
space,removed,so what can this telescope do can it see exo planets
space,removed,dont get me wrong im in no way supporting isis or the horrible acts that they perform but damn they can take a good picture
space,removed,pretty spectacular
space,removed,it looks so magical
space,removed,isis those damn terrorists im so sick ofoh wait oooo what a pretty picture
space,removed,except this is a podcast on dark energy
space,removed,the real sad thing is that you had to use s

space,removed,i misread this northern lights from isis and thought hmm thats interesting but i dont get it
space,removed,i cant be the only one who always misreads it as isis
space,removed,im glad im home alone because i just audibly said well thats fucking cool
space,removed,is it just me or do you guys read iss as isis
space,removed,hillary clinton made this
space,removed,pfft another flat earther clearly the earth is concave
space,removed,thats not the northern lights its green house gas emissions jk
space,removed,holy shit
space,removed,so cool
space,removed,youll need

space,removed,clearly shockwaves from infernal landings
space,removed,i thought this said isis
space,removed,heineken
space,removed,why is it that
space,removed,here is a collection of images of saturn ive taken since my first telescope back in years on earth is roughly a quarter of a saturnian year oldest image in the bottom newest on top telescopes skywatcher skywatcher reflector synscan goto canadian telescope makcassegrain antares reflector skywatcher reflector televue powermate cameras sony cybershot canon imaging source dbk location vancouver bc canada
space,removed,its kinda eerie you know the way it just hangs there in that silent void
space,removed,geez people this gets posted at least once a week we dont need this yet again
space,removed,exactly being downvoted for it anyway
space,removed,and because no one linked to it
space,removed,thanks
space,removed,now that is freaking creepy
space,removed,with the lights on
space,removed,how many times is this gonna be posted
space,removed,yes
space,removed,looks like broken yellow glass

space,removed,and eat your carrots
space,removed,
space,removed,better than waiting for is to pull out respectwomen
space,removed,hope you dont mind but i did this its a great image and some extra editing can really make it shine i just did this through instagram as a demo some lightroom or photoshop work would be much better
space,removed,i think redditors are the only people on earth who still believe that the moon landing actually happened lol
space,removed,hollywood we never landed on the moon it was a way to trick the soviets
space,removed,remindme aug iama apollo
space,removed,found you
space,removed,mythbusters are just government shills who got paid off to do that its so easy to be a conspiratard
space,removed,help me plz
space,removed,my father was raised in vero beach florida and actually went to one of the launches at cape canaveral he told me he was like twenty miles from the launch site and the ground shook as it lifted off
space,removed,apollo landed on the moon pfffft who still believes that malarkey
space,removed,arent there satellites that could take picture
space,removed,the gun that shot that bullet must have been huge
space,removed,good point
space,removed,yes reticles are the little crosshair shapes that some optical instruments have but what were they used for on the apollo missions
space,removed,show me what youve got
space,removed,can i get a hat wobble
space,removed,awesome thank you
space,removed,i cant wait to see what james webb snaps for us
space,removed,nope

space,removed,is it just me or is this picture super pixelated i say fake
space,removed,so its not gonna hit any of that town down there
space,removed,oh my god that was breathtaking i literally held my breath when it went off
space,removed,you dont really notice how big it is until you get off a phrase few female redditors have uttered

space,removed,cool knowing no actual details of this particular event im still going to blame the ruckus between prometheus and pandora for this dust up
space,removed,yep the rocket came in fast it touched down unevenly causing the landing leg piston to crush into an internal crush core buffer material as a result the rocket was initially unsteady and with wave motion it must have waddled across the deck from its initial because when it arrived in port a few days later it was in and httpsiimgurcomgvgqsmtjpg i figure it probably slowly waddled over in the first few hours before spacex recovery engineers were able to if you like the pictures in this post quite a few of them came from httpswwwflickrcomphotosspacex which is epic in every regard the rest i just googled there are loads of awesome shots out there by photographers of every grade spacex do this shit so publicly that anyone can get pictures
space,removed,a fuvking wormhole
space,removed,looks like a smudge by inept use of the upto healing brush tool
space,removed,not necessarily theres a perfectly valid albeit fictional universe in which present actions do not spawn new timelines but time travel does besides you can make a fairly rational argument that thats the case in this universe the everything already happened and is predestined thing i mean
space,removed,but it still took a decade and a democrat to find osama bin laden
space,removed,i made an amazing shot on ur moms face last night
space,removed,
space,removed,you meant chemtrails right
space,removed,that will only last for another year or so well yes hell be by then
space,removed,please dont let this go to your head literally anyone could take this photo if they were given the special access you were given
space,removed,i dont know why everyone is sucking this guys chode literally anyone could take this picture if they were given access but people like to think theyre a special skilled snowflake its the same thing when someone takes an incredible sharp picture and someone else asks what gear theyre using and they get all mad that its not about the gear its meeee well im sure that sharp picture has nothing to do with your very expensive piece of glass and excellent body

space,removed,finally they are coming to finally tell us how ton handle all of this
space,removed,i thought they were first discovered by telescope in
space,removed,its one of my favorites
space,removed,psst you want a hookup nothing shady like just change the tube in youtubecom to pak
space,removed,we need to build a wall and figure out what is happening

space,removed,from the codex they are enormous structures scattered throughout the stars and can create corridors of virtually massfree space allowing instantaneous transit between locations separated by years or even centuries of travel using conventional ftl drives primary mass relays can propel ships thousands of light years often from one spiral arm of the galaxy to another however they have fixed onetoone connections a primary relay connects to one other primary relay and nowhere else
space,removed,nature doesnt make triangles that perfect aliens are real sheeple
space,removed,wat
space,removed,oh boy we just found the first mass relay
space,removed,
space,removed,there is a calendar for amas and i just found out what the fuck is wrong with me years years
space,removed,
space,removed,which is the black hole the bright light in teh center or the whole area in teh center of the photo that kind of looks like a ripple
space,removed,wow this was a really cool story you made me tear up i love space
space,removed,nope not even close
space,removed,lmfao people actually believe this nonsense just because science
space,removed,i got sucked in
space,removed,its incredible and difficult to conceptualize
space,removed,tldr some scientists believe that by we will have created true artificial intelligence a computer with the capability to recursively improve itself so lets say that this computer can solve basic math equations and improve itself the next iteration can solve middle school math then high school then it tells how the universe works all within a few minutes they believe our knowledge will exponentially increase if you were filling up a glass of water exponentially over the course of a minute half the glass would fill up in the last second now imagine this effect with the knowledge we currently possess
space,removed,why does it always have to be circles
space,removed,sone one way a black hole can form is when a super massive black hole implodes have i misunderstood something or is this a typo as a super massive black hole already is a black hole its in the name i know when a sun goes supernova it can implode and that can result in a black hole is this what you mean or am i misunderstanding
space,removed,so they still cant make up their minds th bible never changed just saying
space,removed,your woods is on fire
space,removed,would this be the same as the theory of how time passes during the big bang before planck second gravity and pressure increases temperature to such a point that time does not move so when people ask where did big bang matter come from it was always there as time did not pass perhaps the universe fails to exist or dies out but the singularity increases temperature to the point time doesnt pass resulting in suspended time
space,removed,when you were a kid is this how you saw your life goin complaining about cool pictures of meteor showers on the internet so that you can feel a little bit smarter than a stranger for a second and get your edgy dig on politics in
space,removed,rub it in some more that its been cloudy here for weeks
space,removed,what a stupid fucking comment its just a time exposure picture that allows us to experience ourselves our planet moving through space in a more meaningful way since to our human senses the motion doesnt occur at a meaningful rate when we look up at the sky it doesnt look like we are moving anywhere everything looks still but if we perceived time much more quickly and a period of weeks or months occurred in a matter of seconds then we could get a better feeling of this motion through spaced and experience it in a more meaningful way this is basically what the time exposure picture does although a time exposure video does a better job at it reading about it or seeing an animation in a documentary leave a lot to be desired and seeing pictures from space probes just show the a person perspective which isnt nearly as exciting
space,removed,hey seriously fuck off while socialism of past may not have worked think about the people that tried to establish it not always the best people with the best intentions im not on board but im not against trying it out with some serious revisions everyone knows capitalism has been a complete failure for the masses so what do we try next capitalism or socialism
space,removed,mind fd
space,removed,im so excited for sunday
space,removed,so theres a form of welding thats based on rubbing man ive been welding my whole life
space,removed,in his imagination
space,removed,its also totally wrong
space,removed,and we all are about sixteen billion years old the universe is a fascinating place to be in
space,removed,no japaneses are elevens
space,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgqmdgltzanq
space,removed,bernie would have made college free
space,removed,aliens
space,removed,good point
space,removed,at the risk of going full nerd here understatement
space,removed,nice
space,removed,as a civilian how can i buy or acquire an orlanm space suit
space,removed,we have to go back
space,removed,for and at least at the beginning of the program back in the they probably had many more important other concerns than to track and locate what becomes junk afterwards
space,removed,primarily yes the simplest equation to describe a position on an orbit requires variables angle distance and time alternatively xyt a wave only has value and time or xy
space,removed,i feel like this guy took a bump right before he went on
space,removed,ok deepak chopra whatever you say man just dont put the woo woo on me
space,removed,why do people upvote this shit you all realize this is literally word salad right what exactly do you think this is saying fucking sad shit for a space sub
space,removed,so much space
space,removed,i dont remember paying anything
space,removed,it could be redder
space,removed,
space,removed,least effective use of red line ever
space,removed,
space,removed,buhahahhahahhaa just like their impact on the world a fucking disaster
space,removed,bondage would no longer be a kink it would be a necessity
space,removed,thats quite a lens you have there sir
space,removed,its okay that title made me giggle even though im a fully grown man
space,removed,it was
space,removed,i dont comment all that often but i just wanted to say in the most earnest of terms that the op is a fucking moron for posting this picture if you—the op—or you—someone else—havent the faintest clue why then not only are you a fucking moron but also a fucking clueless moron to boot
space,removed,i was expecting pictures of my butt during the various times ive mooned people done up with instagram filters or something hey someone had to make the joke
space,removed,another interesting fact recent research suggests uranus is actually much larger and gassier than we one believed
space,removed,im glad i got a giggle out first before appreciating the picture itself
space,removed,thinking about getting a job in astronomy color enhancing extrasolar bodies no education or actual knowledge necessary right
space,removed,does uranus have a california cause it looks like parts are on fire
space,removed,uranus farted which is why it looks a little more browner than usual dont worry uranus usually isnt so gassy and itll settle down in a few billion years
space,removed,i cant find the images for luna from that link your provided they just show an artists depiction of a satellite impact can you point me to a good link please
space,removed,did you know there is about to be only planets cause im about to destroy uranus
space,removed,hehehehe uranus is radioactive hehehehe
space,removed,chemtrails man i see em
space,removed,i smush your head
space,removed,hes not your buddy man
space,removed,im pretty sure you cant get it up because the blood flow is different and does not reach the man stick
space,removed,with honors
space,removed,definitely expected dickbutt
space,removed,my cock fucked all girls here does you dick is bored now
space,removed,cool cgi
space,removed,the second one
space,removed,fuck isis
space,removed,the full array wing is x theres of them on the iss
space,removed,i thought the solar panels were buildings
space,removed,now all we need to do is build rainbow road
space,removed,maybe it was named ivanka but trump grabbed it by the pussy and they renamed it ivan the end
space,removed,a new threat to human civilization has emerged space isis
space,removed,there is a bathroom up there what do you think
space,removed,i read it as from isis
space,removed,grodddamnit
space,removed,i read isis instead of iss and was very confused
space,removed,i would of thought holy shit alien invasion
space,removed,i think the aliens have already probed
space,removed,you were bandwidth stealing from midnight planets not cool
space,removed,humans are never going to explore or colonize space in a major way the physics is simply not in our favor
space,removed,curiosity shoots in historial round of golf i hope they remembered to pack a sand wedge
space,removed,im glad curiosity has greater than of estimated service life left
space,removed,whats that white tapelooking stuff on the right and bottom of the hole
space,removed,it can really be frustrating or feel like a waste of time to even try to talk to them but i find it great practice trying to provide evidence for something without referring to nasa or all the photographs they claim are fake heres there hangout link you can join
space,removed,if they drill too deep theyll hit the core and let out all the gravity
space,removed,yeah im sure you know elons will pray to your saviour dickhead
space,removed,if love curiosity to drill into me for minutes to see what im about
space,removed,i wonder if there are fossils in me sigh curiosity please come home
space,removed,lol i guess this is latest sorry guys
space,removed,better keep drilling more holes or well never find kissin kate barlows treasure
space,removed,thats a damn sexy hole half chub would stick my dick in again
space,removed,looks like an old concrete playground with faded paint from a hopscotch border
space,removed,now two planets arent virgins well i guess holes earlier at least
space,removed,imagine if trump put his money into a mars golf course instead of kicking people out of their homes on earth
space,removed,looks like mars is just concrete
space,removed,tldr a billionaire who wants to be president of the world should pick mars as that world someone get donald trump on the phone stat
space,removed,wisp arcana
space,removed,that sounds like a cologne trump would wear
space,removed,transcript of the audio recorded omg didnt anyone teach you to knock first
space,removed,came here to ask this
space,removed,ive been skeptical as to whether or not this is shopped
space,removed,it looks like baby trump with a little tiny hairdo beginning are those kinds of observations allowed on this sub im in reddit blue and cant see sub rules
space,removed,im surprised mars doesnt have a volcano growing and blowing its top while curiosity is drills into mars mud
space,removed,fucking terrifying ok back to me advocating fullcommunism bbl
space,removed,yes
space,removed,almost organic

space,removed,looks a lot more sophisticated than the soyuz ignition whereby a drunk russian man flicks a lit cigarette butt towards the base of the rocket
space,removed,stop my penis can get only so erect
space,removed,such a crazy engine
space,removed,unlike other ovary possessing entities the ssme should not be turned on while attempting to stick your dick in it
space,removed,lol everybodys such a sheep we have never been to space gravity was discovered in we supposedly went to the moon in get it what goes up must come down turn upside down and its and vice versa earth is flat space is an illusion the moon is a hologram get it through your damn heads
space,removed,now thats a startup id like to be part of
space,removed,happy cake day
space,removed,now try to get a physics engine to simulate these kind of forces
space,removed,why
space,removed,that was just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to evidence of water on mars
space,removed,many of the jobs in the industry are engineering or research related skills that i do not have i can have conversations about basic technical details but anything more advance requires further explanation i do have however experience in sales management and business development where can someone like me find positions that require my skillset httpswwwnasagovaboutcareerindexhtml
space,removed,was this just read the instructions or the other one
space,removed,the predicted the idea of a rocket also serving as a space capsule which in reality is pretty farfetched what did become a viable idea however was the idea of a direct accent lunar landing at one point the united states and the soviet union considered using a single capsule that would also function as the lunar lander direct accent but the rocketry at the time would have been unfeasible nasa had plans eventually for a rocket nova that would have had the ability to launch a single capsule no separate lem but would have probably used eight rocketdyne engines versus the five on the saturn v
space,removed,i dunno im calling real a high iso throughout the image group lit by dying embers no signs of blending and maybe mountaintop lit by far city lights
space,removed,clearly your not from nz
space,removed,
space,removed,this looks so fake that it must be real
space,removed,fake
space,removed,beautiful view of beautiful night
space,removed,wouldnt a shot like that have to be tracked to a star as well plus having lived down the road for nearly years im pretty sure the stars arent in the correct orientation
space,removed,cool but fake the audio in them is heavily processed to sound meaningful nd supposedly has miraculous healing qualities
space,removed,wallpaper material
space,removed,im actually speechless this thing is just so amazing
space,removed,reavers
space,removed,if bush gets to take credit for clintons work which was greater than reagans by the way you idiot piece of shit then then we know that trump will steal credit for obamas work in any event you are a horribly boorish and stupid asshole and you should be killed immediately but we will wait until you are done sucking trump dick to kill you
space,removed,i read jim carrey and read the whole thing expecting a joke at the end i thought it was pretty solemn for carrey
space,removed,i literally just gagged thats a perspective i hadnt even entertained yet
space,removed,
space,removed,i just dont think the trek audience were able to accept a lesbian captain they didnt want to masturbate to
space,removed,aliens new number who this
space,removed,hes not wrong
space,removed,we human beings are still divided into nation states but these states are rapidly becoming a single global civilization and now it feels like were going in reverse
space,removed,we will build a wall and the aliens will pay for it believe me we will make planet earth great again
space,removed,lol
space,removed,but these states are rapidly becoming and single global civilization lol
space,removed,build spaceships on earth or face tariffs
space,removed,bite my shiny metal ass
space,removed,theres something wistfully nostalgic and classy about this picture
space,removed,in english
space,removed,billion that seems tiny
space,removed,come at us space bitches
space,removed,how long is that tiny dick is it like adam size plz help
space,removed,i dont know why but ready this made me cry
space,removed,we are rapidly becoming a single global civilization thats where youre wrong kiddo
space,removed,this is the kind of thing that makes me proud to be a human being
space,removed,shit is gay
space,removed,jim carrey is a great actor and great dude love this
space,removed,thought it was jim carrey until i reached the end
space,removed,carter was a bad man
space,removed,the riaa we will even fuck up interstellar communication
space,removed,its a cookbook
space,removed,
space,removed,wall
space,removed,boobs
space,removed,fuckin sexy ass signature though
space,removed,im sure et will find it good thing et speaks english too mericans 🦄
space,removed,why are you so obsessed with me aliens
space,removed,this is perfect for english speaking aliens everywhere
space,removed,its a flip of a coin a gamble and you either think the bet is worth the risk or its not you allude yourself to the fact its utterly pointless to try and reason out the will of aliens the only thing well definitely have in common is mathematics everything else down to fundamentals such as morals and logic could be different but for me the potential benefits of first contact outweigh the risks sure i agree that disaster up to and including total annihilation is a real possibility but frankly thats almost a certainty without first contact maybe im being pessimistic but i really dont see us shedding things like tribalism without such an event and tribalism is going to be our doom imho im not looking for benevolent overlords and frankly i dont think we need them even something like viewing actual real long dead alien megastructures around other stars would have a profound impact on our society at least i hope it would anyway i digress aliens could view us a a plague that needs to be wiped out who knows maybe carbon based life is abhorrent to them aliens might view us as a fascinating science experiment to be prodded and probed on a planetary scale aliens might be well meaning but seriously fuck us over inadvertently aliens say hello and leave nothing happens probably the least likely aliens say hello and go on their way a revolution happens once we realise were not alone and theres something to aim for aliens say hello give us some stuff and teach us how to us it our society changes in untold ways including the end of poverty desease and maybe even death any of the above are possible along with a whole host of other possibilities as its looking more likely were going to kill ourselves anyway why not do things that infinitesimally increase our chances of getting a roll of the dice or a better analogy were already standing on the cliff edge why not play russian roulette the only thing i do know if theyre not coming for our resources unless you include the sun and they are tapping all the stars in the galaxy to do some cool kardashev level shit
space,removed,this made me cry can carter be president again
space,removed,youre the best
space,removed,i got chills reading this thank you for sharing
space,removed,i want this president
space,removed,lol
space,removed,about the most useful thing he did as potus
space,removed,i cried a little this is actually very beautiful
space,removed,best thing to emerge from the carter administration
space,removed,this made me cry for some reason
space,removed,sounds like he knew something
space,removed,yee
space,removed,that gave me chills for a solid seconds
space,removed,i like jimmy and i love voyager
space,removed,interestingly enough the elections usually used to work this way before andrew jackson won the presidential election in from what i remember from my history class people rarely ran for president meaning they didnt seek votes or make campaign promises as it made them seem unworthy in the eyes of the public
space,removed,lol
space,removed,i dont understnad it
space,removed,dibs
space,removed,uh and who had arranged for them to be earths
space,removed,no
space,removed,look up interkosmos
space,removed,itokawa compared to the paris skyline hope this helps
space,removed,i would get make it larger cover it in give it a not unlike saturn put it in and give it tones of extra moons to look at
space,removed,theres a radius marking the edge of what mere mortals could see thats not how radii work theres a billionlightyear radius marking the edge of what mere mortals could see
space,removed,to be fair the guys point wasnt you are a coward despite that it seemed to have been you are a coward because you didnt really do that i dont think the guy was saying the act of being flung to the moon with a rocket strapped to your back is not something worthy of respect but that aldrin was not worthy of his respect because he did not do that in his mind
space,removed,theyre both
space,removed,umextraterrestrial means not earthright
space,removed,you forgot jupiter
space,removed,nothing official just personal conversations with a few industry insiders take with the usual grain of salt but im pretty sure they knew what they were talking about
space,removed,dammit physics are relentless kk bunny hop it is my people need meeeeeeee
space,removed,they dont want you to see certain things think about it
space,removed,glad somebody is addressing this urban legend of the saturn v being a bigger dick than sls this biggest dick contest is interesting but ultimately infantile leo and geo are just reference levels not something to derive absolute reference markers a lot of people need to start moving away from this mindset of absolutes the sls is designed for deep space it has been so long since leaving earth orbit that a whole generation isnt able to comprehend the differences in requirements wonder how many people noticed the sls is going to get deep space probes faster to their destinations a europa mission that launched atop an sls block as opposed to a united launch alliance atlas v rocket could shave years off the journey from years down to years and carry twice as much payload dalee said size really does matter in multiple ways sanders said
space,removed,someone get michael bay on the phone
space,removed,earth is not extraterrestrial tho
space,removed,lol doesnt make you feel better to downvote my comments on a post from days ago
space,removed,earth is not extraterrestrial by definition off the word
space,removed,this gave me goosebumps
space,removed,fall into a black oceon of nothingness
space,removed,this is bullshit a black hole is a star thats collapsing on itself the gravity so strong supposedly that light cant reflect back and escape the gravity making it invisible but it still remains a dense lump of matter you cant thru it youll just get crushed as a matter of fact it would probably pull matter into itself until it grows like a snowball that added matter burying the gravity until its pull is lessened and is no longer a black hole but probably a planet or maybe its refueling itself so in the future it will spark up and become a star again where people are getting it turns into a wormhole why would the sun stop being a solid body when its gravity becomes so strong it crushes it self what exactly are u going thru maybe the gravity is so strong it draws or pinches two ends of space and draws them together that going thru one would reach the other point but still how can you go thru a solid dense of matter that light cant even escape it
space,removed,simulation of what you might see if you fell into a black hole
space,removed,earth isnt extraterrestrial
space,removed,you can tell its a neat by the way it is
space,removed,sigh im going to give you an upvote but only because i expected someone to do it but you should feel bad
space,removed,holy shet
space,removed,honestly i think looking at this made me blind
space,removed,you would die before this
space,removed,spaghettification intensifies
space,removed,i thought for sure the last thing i saw would be a dickbutt if someone makes this change by tomorrow it will be front page garontee
space,removed,rip the savory savior
space,removed,fuck me black holes are crazy
space,removed,what about the initial shredding of your atoms by tidal forces
space,removed,woah
space,removed,or less
space,removed,simulation shit looks like it was done in photoshop
space,removed,made the mistake of squinting youre an asshole
space,removed,at which point would i be dead
space,removed,i thought it was pretty well understood that you wouldnt see anything because youd be dead the gravitational pull would rip your body completely apart into atoms
space,removed,i believe this is what he is referring to there are images further down the page of black holes the second and third pictures are the realistic ones while the first one is a little more flashy
space,removed,httpimgurcomvczxpkj
space,removed,you wouldnt though you would spaghettify
space,removed,fair answer 👍
space,removed,noooooooooopppppe
space,removed,excuse my lack of verbiage but that is sick as fuck
space,removed,but but but how do they know
space,removed,would you live if you went into a black hole
space,removed,so it would always be black nothingness on the other side
space,removed,well theres something i hope to never experience
space,removed,seconded
space,removed,where do i sign up for this
space,removed,was expecting to see dickbutt
space,removed,alright alright alright
space,removed,but how do we know this theories blow my mind
space,removed,but from an independent observer outside of the black hole that process would literally take until the end of the universe to happen relativitys a bitch
space,removed,when are we going to send s satellite into one of these
space,removed,i think i just got car spaceship sick
space,removed,wouldnt your eyeballs be crushed
space,removed,wouldnt it be the other way round the blackness you see is because youre looking in the direction of the singularity so trying to boost away from it should cause it to take up less of your vision not more right intuitively if youre freefalling in the only light you receive is from directly above you while if you try to resist you may see light emitted from your sides as well no
space,removed,fuck thats crazy a billion different things that can erase our existence almost immediately comforting
space,removed,jesus that is fucking terrifying
space,removed,so who here is actually an astrophysicist lmao
space,removed,if ftfy douche bag
space,removed,i was honestly expecting a dickbutt but this is neat
space,removed,goddamn im so dumb
space,removed,how about the normal way
space,removed,the math checks out
space,removed,cool story bro
space,removed,murph dont let me go
space,removed,physics
space,removed,depends on who is looking
space,removed,aaand theeeeeen
space,removed,bull shit
space,removed,its even bigger than no mans sky it has literally nothing in common with no mans sky why even mention it
space,removed,why the fuck does this have upvotes
space,removed,my mind just broke
space,removed,can we get a please
space,removed,too much black i cant see anything in there
space,removed,doubt it
space,removed,wheres all the monkeys at
space,removed,watch it in vr
space,removed,this is terrifying
space,removed,wow that was terrifying
space,removed,this person is a troll
space,removed,alright alright alright
space,removed,frankly i dont think we should be collaborating with iss they are terrorists
space,removed,well they helped us bring mark watney home so maybe there is hope
space,removed,and thank you for not telling people shit thats not already accessible public knowledge
space,removed,theyre building the worlds biggest radio telescope too thats an upper hand on the aliens
space,removed,goddamnit and i was trying to steal a tech
space,removed,alright nerds unify classical physics and quantum physics or face nuclear incineration
space,removed,what is up with this comment chain being the same format some old joke
space,removed,first page of google for your exact question has this link there are no stupid questions but there are fucking lazy ones
space,removed,heres the plan wait for the china cucks to actually put resources into developing the ideas they stole from us if any of those crazy ideas work then nuke them then steal the technology they developed from our ideas back agreed
space,removed,technology doesnt correlate with population that was a dumb argument by you how is population related with the required amount of rd spending
space,removed,bot test please ignore this comment
space,removed,i understood that reference
space,removed,wuzetian clan aint nothing to fuck rith
space,removed,i agree but dropping the atomic weapon leads to faster innovation
space,removed,at least their leader isnt gandhi
space,removed,america has stolen your tech of engineering we can now build that wall
space,removed,lu cixin wrote them one comes out this fall
space,removed,who in turn poach from us yes thats how the economy works you pay people what theyre worth or if youre microsoft you rig the process and illegally collaborate with other companies to illegally suppress worker wages
space,removed,this game is pure terror i was cruising around our galaxy taking in the sites when i saw a nebula to my right i decided i wanted a closer look so i zip my scroll wheel a few times and end up going max speed which is like a googol miles an hour after about seconds i realize im not getting much closer so i stop thinking something is wrong and turn around sweet moses in a river was that a mistake the milky way galaxy is about the size of a dime with nothing but black filling the screen i freaked the hell out and immediately the game the universe is quite large
space,removed,well we managed to get boys in the girls bathroom this year so take that china
space,removed,whats more so many space exploration technologies come from or go to military technologies we really dont need the chinese having pinpoint intercontinental ballistics missiles or godtier satellites with imagining and targeting capabilities and the likes
space,removed,this whole comment thread should go to riamverysmart because damn uthemachphisto you are really smart arent you
space,removed,it is a simulation
space,removed,only trillions though not quintillion
space,removed,so kinda like no mans sky but free
space,removed,thanks for sharing
space,removed,procedurally generated is going to be the new buzz word isnt it
space,removed,mars is a rouge planet
space,removed,lol biggets
space,removed,charge and be shifty about whether it has multiplayer

space,removed,why no earth
space,removed,why are venus and titan not nearly as reported on as mars
space,removed,
space,removed,mars looks beautiful
space,removed,mars looks so similar to earth
space,removed,the earth seems to be a quite comfy place
space,removed,mars looks nice i may have to plan a vacation
space,removed,nice rocks
space,removed,space nothing dirt
space,removed,the picture on the left is from ireland the picture on the right is what nasa released from the mars rover

space,removed,gonna need a picture of a banana next to it
space,removed,all these worlds are yours except europa attempt no landing there use them together use them in peace

space,removed,yes i am very sexy
space,removed,i dont know what but the venus one is very unsettling to me
space,removed,its daylight
space,removed,i dont believe you
space,removed,because the most of poor people are selfish assholes such as yourself plenty of help out there in the world plenty of opportunities to get back on your feet plenty of jobs in the world if you think that these people with all these things going for them should halt something as important to mankind expansion through space exploration then youre a degenerate moron and people like you is what is holding back our desires to do more
space,removed,but i do
space,removed,how can i get a copy of this on my wall
space,removed,wait when the fuck did they send a rovor to titan
space,removed,i love venus surreal
space,removed,by having a close at the pictures of the different planets here we should be able to tell which one is a hoax on one hand the hydrocarbons are thought to form in titans upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the chemical reactions of gas methane through the suns ultraviolet light resulting in a thick orange dense smog another factor that shields titan from the suns fiery wind to take into account is the fact that titans is in close proximity to saturns magnetosphere mars has been known as the red planet as far back as i recall this is the color it appears when looking at it from a distance because of rusty dust spread out through its atmosphere however if we have a close look it would appear its true color more like butterscotch along with other colors due to the various mineral content the planet has listen up to what nasa says about venus per according to nasas solar system exploration everything in venus appears red because of a thick layer of atmosphere that filters out the actual shades of color the planet appears bright white when observed from space because of its cloud cover however its surface rocks are variations of gray similar to rocks on earth lets see what quora has to say the color a rock will appear on one planet might be different than the same rock would appear on a different planet this is the case as the contents of the planets atmosphere may contain different gases that affects what color we see as the sunlight reflects to our eyes filtering certain colors quora goes on to say that venus appears dull yellow when seen from space which is due to the sulfuric content in venus atmosphere if on the venus surface its rocky surface will be reddish brown venus never has a clear light blue in its atmosphere as the picture shows here please tell me how is it possible to get venus look blue when this is not its natural color
space,removed,its a conspiracy
space,removed,gruyere is swiss but doesnt have holes
space,removed,i wonder how much does this cost
space,removed,awb onesky
space,removed,depends on what space means to you look up from the monitor at a wall with nothing in between look at the wall look at yourself what is between what color is it transparent its not totally empty it is filled with trillions of air molecules microscopic dust and mineral particles viruses bacteria so on but keep looking at the wall and remove all the molecules that are in it and what is it empty no not empty yet that space between you and the wall is filled with a magnetic field electric fields gravitational field cosmic rays solar particles and most of all full of photons so that is why you are able to see the wall so keep looking at the wall and erase all the invisible energy including the photons what happens it is no longer transparent it is the absence of photons black that is the spacetime between you and the wall now imagine the wall out in the eternity of nothing and the wall disappears with everything else that is the spacetime of nothing that extends to infinity so spacetime is limitless however our physical universe of the visible and tangible is and has been measured the cosmic microwave background cmb has been measured in a complete sphere around our local reference frame and it is about billion lightyears in radius in this timeslice of the present some physicists recently printed a representational model it is data but highly exaggerated but it demonstrates the omnidirectional cmb as we are measuring it at this point in time
space,removed,get a good tripod one with a pistol grip and that is taller than you preferably makes binoculars even better
space,removed,i use to do this i got sick of nothing happening

space,removed,science is just thinly veiled male machismo and sexual impotence
space,removed,for those curious and its just as weird as usual for those who dont know are kind of a tradition for nro missions
space,removed,friendly reminder to go suck a dick
space,removed,the nro has spy satellites plus numerous predecessors however it is almost that the spares that were gifted came from the failed httpsenwikipediaorgwikifutureimageryarchitecture optical the government wanted to revolutionise spy technology and boeing over promised to break into lockheeds monopoly which with bad parts and tight congressional strictures resulted in the most spectacular and expensive failure in the history of american spy satellite projects so definitely not business as usual also the nro led the creation of computer controlled mirror polishing which was later used on the hubble

space,removed,there were a lot of things we couldnt do in an but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact people often asked us if because of this fact it was fun to fly the jet fun would not be the first word i would use to describe flying this plane intense maybe even cerebral but there was one day in our sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there at least for a moment it occurred when walt and i were flying our final training sortie we needed hours in the jet to complete our training and attain mission ready status somewhere over colorado we had passed the century mark we had made the turn in arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly my gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months ripping across the barren deserts feet below us i could already see the coast of california from the arizona border i was finally after many humbling months of simulators and study ahead of the jet i was beginning to feel a bit sorry for walter in the back seat there he was with no really good view of the incredible sights before us tasked with monitoring four different radios this was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital it had been difficult too for me to relinquish control of the radios as during my entire flying career i had controlled my own transmissions but it was part of the division of duties in this plane and i had adjusted to it i still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground however walt was so good at many things but he couldnt match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading he understood that and allowed me that luxury just to get a sense of what walt had to contend with i pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him the predominant radio chatter was from los angeles center far below us controlling daily traffic in their sector while they had us on their scope albeit briefly we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace we listened as the shaky voice of a lone cessna pilot asked center for a readout of his ground speed center replied november charlie im showing you at ninety knots on the ground now the thing to understand about center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a cessna or to air force one they always spoke in the exact same calm deep professional tone that made one feel important i referred to it as the houston center voice i have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this countrys space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the houston controllers that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did and it didnt matter what sector of the country we would be flying in it always seemed like the same guy was talking over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere conversely over the years pilots always wanted to ensure that when transmitting they sounded like chuck yeager or at least like john wayne better to die than sound bad on the radios just moments after the cessnas inquiry a twin beech piped up on frequency in a rather superior tone asking for his ground speed i have you at one hundred and twentyfive knots of ground speed boy i thought the beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his cessna brethren then out of the blue a navy pilot out of nas lemoore came up on frequency you knew right away it was a navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios center dusty ground speed check before center could reply im thinking to myself hey dusty has a ground speed indicator in that milliondollar cockpit so why is he asking center for a readout then i got it ol dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from mount whitney to the mojave knows what true speed is hes the fastest dude in the valley today and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new hornet and the reply always with that same calm voice with more distinct alliteration than emotion dusty center we have you at on the ground and i thought to myself is this a ripe situation or what as my hand instinctively reached for the mic button i had to remind myself that walt was in control of the radios still i thought it must be done in mere seconds well be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost that hornet must die and die now i thought about all of our sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming i was torn somewhere miles above arizona there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet then i heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat that was the very moment that i knew walter and i had become a crew very professionally and with no emotion walter spoke los angeles center aspen can you give us a ground speed check there was no hesitation and the replay came as if was an everyday request aspen i show you at one thousand eight hundred and fortytwo knots across the ground i think it was the fortytwo knots that i liked the best so accurate and proud was center to deliver that information without hesitation and you just knew he was smiling but the precise point at which i knew that walt and i were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say in his most fighterpilotlike voice ah center much thanks were showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money for a moment walter was a god and we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the houston center voice when lacame back with roger that aspen your equipment is probably more accurate than ours you boys have a good one it all had lasted for just moments but in that short memorable sprint across the southwest the navy had been flamed all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the king of speed and more importantly walter and i had crossed the threshold of being a crew a fine days work we never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast for just one day it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there

space,removed,tell me that when they start losing as many crews as sts did
space,removed,we did it reddit time to harass his family and colleagues
space,removed,none of it would have ever happened if they would have killed shuttle one of the biggest pork projects in history killed brave astronauts for the sake of jobs reports in congress everything shuttle did could have been done cheaper safer and faster with conventional rockets to put things in perspective a shuttle launch cost roughly a billion dollars and could take metric tons to low earth orbit and was always flown with crew a delta iv launch which can take metric tons to low earth orbit costs around million a spacex falcon can take metric tons to leo for million dollars it wasnt reuseable unless you consider total disassembly and refurbishment as well as replacement of most parts reuseability the only redeeming quality the shuttle had was the volume and size of its payload bay which allowed it to carry iss modules this could have been accomplished by other massively less expensive means fucking pisses me off every time i think about it we could have had a goddamn moon base for fucks sake

space,removed,bullshit because as you can see the escaoe capsule was firing up seconds before the explosion happened

space,removed,im tempted to extrapolate from the fact that time slows down more and more for a ship traveling closer and closer to the speed of light so if it were possible to actually reach that impossible speed then i believe time would completely stop for the lightspeed traveler i guess transit would appear to be instantaneous for him even though time would have passed for the origin and destination a lightspeed boomerang would return at the same time it has left from the boomerangs point of view it might appear to have not moved at all but suddenly it would be in the future
space,removed,this is true it kinda gave me chills when i saw that the tradition in mecca is to circle the cube just like saturns rings definitely some shit going on that has been lost over the ages
space,removed,nods head yep yepwait what am i looking at now
space,removed,explosions in low desity orbits are very different and inefficient propellants because they mostly dissipates near instantly to all the vacuum around it and barely accellerates any matter other than a spherical bubble of the exploding matter itself explosions get sucked by vacuum and barely create any pressure waves that accellerates nearby matter
space,removed,im such a failure what the fuck how did i not know this oh my god i had just gotten over learning about saturn man and now this

space,removed,lol didnt know that now i do
space,removed,a new type of human a martian maybe
space,removed,i do not believe in flat earth the fact that so many of you by way of sampling the few responses think i do shows that you are polarized and think if u think this you must think that which is why the world is so messed up on other subjects but i do know this image is digitally manipulated and stitched together with a fake earth and an existing image of the moon go ahead use photo forensics online and see for yourself

space,removed,how is it even possible to absolutely love something youre completely and utterly ignorant about that doesnt make sense if you even remotely care about something you put some effort into learning more about it if you cant even be arsed to put in the minimum amount of effort it takes to get a basic level of understanding of something then you cannot say you like it because you clearly dont youre just jerking yourself off living out your pseudointellectual stonerfantasies like of people on the fucking internet if you want to know about space go and fucking learn about it dont just act like you care because you want people to think you care fucking care or move on stop lying to yourself and everyone else its so selfindulgent and smallminded that its sickening you obviously missed quite a lot when you were at school i mean you learn about the basics of space in fucking primary school and yet you clearly were so interested in space that you completely ignored it and then went on to ignore it at secondary school too hardcore brah

space,removed,the whole point of a reentry module is to be aerodynamically stable like a marble in a bowl if there are any external perturbations it automatically passively tries to return to the proper orientation with respect to the incoming airstream this is typically also the case with airplanes with the exception of modern fighter craft that would be unstable and indeed unpilotable if not for computers continuously tweaking the control surfaces

space,removed,in latin our satellites name is luna because a significant chunk of english comes from latin many terms associated with the moon are related to this latin name — for example the adjective lunar and the noun lunatic an oldfashioned word for a mentally ill person madness was thought to be correlated with the phases of the moon in greek our moon is named selene as is the moon goddess of ancient greek mythology the english word selenology or the study of the moons geology derives from it

space,removed,the two world wars gave us domesticated weapons but penicillin and many other discoveries were discovered by people who didnt need to work and had both free time and money which enabled them to pursue their scientific interests instead of working menial repetitive jobs innovations like basic income could be just as important to human advancement as killing muslims

space,removed,as the squishys ship entered the systems oort cloud it began spewing out millions of little von neumann machines that proceeded to gobble up a bunch of asteroids and comets and build from their constituent matter a large rockyice intelligence which shall hereby be referred to as rice meanwhile the squishy noticed a gas giant wandering through the oort cloud and thought it had interesting swirls so he moved his ship into orbit around it the squishy then proceeded to pass out for a few thousand years while the squishy slept rice began building and manufacturing all the necessary components for an approximately two hundred thousand year observation period of the third planet from the star which observations from nearby interstellar civilizations agreed was at the beginning of a mass extinction event the squishys civilization had bid on and been awarded this contract by offering to do the whole thing dirtcheap via their new rice technology they were to observe closeup and collate the resulting footage of said mass extinction which would then be distributeddisseminated across the galaxy and various satellite galaxies this being of monumental significance to the squishys entire civilization as it would upjump them into the more important sectors of galactic federation the spectacle that was a mass extinction sometimes called planet ex had recently ie within the last few million years become widely loved by the galaxy et al it being the preferred form of entertainment of watching the quick and the slow of millions of species going extinct it made them feel all warm and gooey inside these interstellar civilizations to see life snuffed out en masse but why was he here the squishy asked himself every time he woke if rice was handling everything perhaps it was because his civilization wanted something squishy and familiar and biological a fault of his civilization yes but he could understand their fears of not wanting this screwed up of having him as the backup and maybe too he was here to keep rice company for these asteroidcomet level artificial intelligences could if left alone for long enough become eccentric for example there was the time a ricelike mind drastically lowered its albedo and altered its infrared signature and disappeared into a systems oort cloud and when its squishy woke he was met with a message asking him if he wanted to play hide and seek and that the rice was hiding and would he please come and find it then there was the time a rice tried to assemble itself into its own planet and thereby grow its own life which ended with no life and a despondent rice and an attempted suicide by star the most common eccentricity however was when a rice molded asteroids into pleasing configurations eg making gigantic asteroidal squishies though these tended to be unstable and somewhat disturbing to said squishy to see oneself orders of magnitude larger with every physical characteristic of oneself rendered and exaggerated in rock and ice though it should be noted that the rice usually only meant this as a sincere gesture its way of saying i like you squishy
space,removed,and there are probably people sacrificing goats too you debase this subreddit by posting comments about these fringe groups of people who post a video to youtube even assuming that such videos exist and that they werent posted by people like you

space,removed,remindme month
space,removed,actually if theyre any smart theyll realize it is anomalous for many reasons including that it is made of material that the oxygen we need to survive would oxidize it quickly on geologicalastronomical timescales and therefore is either manmade or asteroidal in origin

space,removed,dont hate me here but the agencies that take pictures are a bit to blame why the hell do they use such wide field of views when taking pictures from space for instance this video thats not what you see from the iss the iss is really really close to earth yet they keep releasing videos and photos with huge field of views that exaggerate the earth roundness you see from the iss this is how close the iss is to the earth
space,removed,on first read i thought it said isis
space,removed,like if you read this as isis
space,removed,its really close to earth maybe not for us tiny humans but in the earth scale is pretty much touching it obviously altered photos and videos that make it look like its half way to geostationary orbit and you call people morons for questioning it ok
space,removed,i swear i read isis
space,removed,why are you redistributing isis propaganda drain the swamp
space,removed,but the earth is flat
space,removed,say what you will about isis but they do provide the world with fantastic photographs boggles the mind they can be so violent at the same time

space,removed,would it be possible to increase the sensitivity of gravitywave detection in order to see all objects in the universe in other words something other than the visual spectrum uv ir gamma etc i just figured all objects in the universe should be giving off some sort of gravity waves no matter how infinitesimally small seem like a good way to detect objects that are invisible through any other means perhaps could even be able to be used to see things in great detail that we couldnt see with optics but i understand that the equipment would have to be incredibly sensitive and precise to achieve these things

space,removed,thats a lot of money to test something people dont agree is real the people in this instance refers to the near universal consensus among the scientific community almost no one is taking this drive seriously
space,removed,how much money and how many years of time are going to be spent debunking this nonsense its been years if the drive worked respectable scientists and respectable institutions would have been using it by now even if they had no idea how it fundamentally worked
space,removed,i figured as much due to well how tiny gravity is i figured that if youre only detecting supermassive things like black holes it must be because only black holes are strong enough to detect still i thought maybe as time goes on we could hopefully create devices that can detect tinier and tinier waves i assume that wed need to have such devices stay in as deep of space as we can though as to avoid as much interference as possible much the same reason telescopes are best outside of earths atmosphere im not a scientist or anything just a thought

space,removed,when youre met with bluff and bluster it usually means people dont want you asking you could go the conspiracy route or you could just take them at their word there are plenty of other angles you can look at the same formations if you are interested in seeing them at such a stark angle perspective tricks happen easily
space,removed,when someone claims to see things that people dont want them talking about theyre usually suffering from an abundance of something else youre looking at a photo with a resolution per pixel this is the moon our moon the thing that hasnt changed much in centuries there are many logical possibilities that dont involve wait look at that unnatural formation i think theres something like a foundation on the moon which is what you initially proposed the reason people arent giving definitive answers is because we dont want to split hairs with your bias we see exactly how that would go you initially wanted to argue something made a fucking gigantic thing on the bloody moon thats why this is stupid
space,removed,it makes you appear like a cock says the guy who has constantly been asking inane questions he could google the results to said to the guy who has been consistently patiently responding to him with answers and potential solutions despite the general understanding among adults that a fucking long moonbase might be something other people would pick up on when studying the motherfucking moon for a century

space,removed,i dont know who made this gif i dont know his story and i dont care were talking about the gif not what bullshit hes trying to represent with it i know the scales are wrong thats extremely obvious i also mentioned the planet lagging thing was wrong those two things are obvious this is not a vortex its a helical pattern a vortex is something which rotates and comes back to its original position thats only the case when you look at the classical model which is also correct from the galacticcenter pov you dont come back to your original position the sentence the helical model our solar system is a vortex makes absolutely no sense to the educated reader thats like saying this apple is large and its small that gif is also accurate its just taken from another pov this one is from the pov of a source standing in the galactic center and looking at the solar system the one you showed was from the perspective of some one standing on the galactic center and not actively rotating in order to see the solar system i quickly read what the astrophysicists are saying i agree with what they say for the most part the problem is that they have read about the theory the idiot who made this gif came up with that theory is obviously completely bullshit they are debunking his theory if you asked them this exact question which includes all of my points they will agree is this visualization besides from the planet lagging and scale a correct visualization of the trajectories of the planetary objects around the nonrotating galactic pointcenter from an observer who is actively looking at our solar system correct to clear some things up i am not saying that the classical model is wrong i am simply saying that under these assumptions assuming the observer is located at the nonrotating galactic pointcenter and is actively looking at our galaxy assuming the lines represent distance travelled from the observers pov assuming the scales are wrong knowing the lagging thing is not true this gif is accurate

space,removed,astronomy cast man it is absolutely the bomb
space,removed,i imagine it wouldnt affect it meteorites themselves are quite valuable and there is a pretty good market for them already a gold meteorite would not go into the general gold market rather it would go into the meteorite market where it would be far more valuable also please consider that most meteors burn up in our atmosphere so even a dense meteor shower would have very few actual meteorites reaching the surface this means that any meteorites made of precious metals would be extremely rare and thus probably worth far more in their orginal form than melted down into jewelry or coins

space,removed,higher res imagery is available publicly from if you want higher res you can buy it from httpswwwdigitalglobecom modis noaa digital globe and landsat have never been classified that data record stretches back to submeter resolution aerial photos predating the satellite record are available from the httpwwwscarorgdataproducts library the university of minnesotas httpwwwpgcumnedu is probably the best resource for free extremely highres aerial and satellite imagery the conspiracy theorists like to point at antarctica and claim data is being suppressed but they dont seem to understand how satellite data is collected or the fact that there is very little need for highres data over vast uninhabited polar areas processing high resolution data takes a huge amount of resources and effort
space,removed,what is this from

space,removed,where did that mph come from you arent moving relative to the earth at mph guessing that number is the speed earth revolves that is relative to something outside earth not something on it like if you were on the moon looking at the earth you would see it revolving at x speed but if you are at the surface you are moving as fast as the earth rotates if you are standing still so why pull up the mph it as nothing to do with the question

space,removed,yes unless you fancy overlords
space,removed,preeeeetty sure theres no such clan apart from anything else evans is a welsh surname scottish clan evans was the first clan to be recognized by the english crown they helped to delay the norman conquest of england when they crafted a few small boats and rammed the rafts that were carrying the norman invaders across from what is now france drowning the invaders they were awarded special status for their service it took the normans a few generations to breed enough new soldiers to reinvade when they did clan evans fighting men once again reported for service this time the king had left his brother in charge who did not have a clue and jailed them all then started executing them one at a time that is why the norman conquest of england happened jump ahead many years and in the clan evans fought for independence they did really well in the scottish highlands but when they marched on london they were slaughtered the lesson was supply lines matter the english tell a different story about this war which is nothing like that preserved in my familys history so clan evans moved to the new world once they were established they started the american revolution their leader was known by the code name the third son of the third king of scotland im descended from him and several others who fought for our independence they won and went back to raising sheep a few years later the descendants of english colonists overthrew their government at the constitutional convention thats where history was rewritten and our socalled founding fathers got the credit one of my ancestors samuel evans slipped into the constitutional convention and signed the us constitution as a drunken prank ben franklin had a group physically throw him out then ben franklin remember he was a printer carefully removed every trace of ink that samuel evans had left on that copy of the us constitution it was proved he did sign the us constitution a few years back because they could see where his pen broke the fibers in the paper the oldest son of the oldest son of the third son of the third king of scotland was called the heir to the american revolution i say was because the last heir took off to australia to start a revolution there when they confiscated all their citizens guns and got himself killed

space,removed,yeah rickrussel is right weather is one of the areas where throwing more money at the problem absolutely makes a difference the europeans invested billions of dollars into their weather model and todays models are as accurate as models were years ago they estimate with current and consistent funding they gain about day of accuracy per decade which could definitely accelerate if the promise of machine learning bears out most of their forecasts are produced by a pair of core supercomputing clusters being upgraded to a pair of core clusters by the current system has peak performance of teraflops and will soon max out at the us system is comparatively shittier because congress keeps cutting funding in an effort to privatize us forecasting and to defund the noaa fortunately after sandy they provided a little money to upgrade the us system which was turned on this year prior to february the us system had a peak performance of teraflops with the sandy funds were up to teraflops momentarily outcomputing the europeans though their models are still better so their forecasts are more accurate

space,removed,waiting here for europa report references like
space,removed,it looks like something from rshittyfoodporn i didnt read the headline and thought it was some kind of melted burnt cheese dish with bad lighting
space,removed,what actually amazes me is how a third world country is spending more than per year on a space program about of indians live off less than per day well at least they now how these nice pictures to look at if only they had a pc with internet connection
space,removed,interesting factoid mars is actually a flat disc constantly accelerating towards us faster and faster considering its only about miles away it should reach us any day
space,removed,i just never get tired of that word uranus hehe there it is again
space,removed,in the past people thought the moon was cheese now we see a similar dream but instead of cheese its curry
space,removed,in the moon people see a man or a rabbit or whatever what do people see in mars
space,removed,not bad seeing as they just taped a used iphone to a firework and set the camera timer to six months then whatsapped the picture back
space,removed,actually it says more about their incompetence as a country
space,removed,no they dont they relied very heavily on american assistance to do something the nasa does routinely they are doing poorly and this is a shitty picture its a waste of their resources to even have a space program theyd be better off feeding their starving populace and cleaning up the feces they throw on their streets
space,removed,speaking of gas giants people shit on the ground in india yet have a rover
space,removed,shit on indias space program designated e s i g n a t e d
space,removed,i can only hope this will all change with the combined efforts of nasa spacex and governmentscorporations all over the world working on new methods i really hope this microwave thrust idea goes somewhere my understanding is that if it works once in space a vehicle shoukd be able to run its engine nonstop and theoretically slowly approach the speed of light its probably take ages to reach that with current tech but hopefully larger and perfected engines will be far better and accelerate faster if thats really the case then lightspeed travel may not be totally out of reach in our lifetime i can only hope
space,removed,it was probably a big boost to the million indians that have to take a crap on the street every day
space,removed,india has a mars orbitor
space,removed,india has spacecrafts yet they barely have any roads trains toilets clean water

space,removed,glad to see the tax i pay for india humanitarian aid is being spent well 😑
space,removed,yeah cool uk gives india billions in aid cos they so poor indian government ignore poverty and spend on space programs
space,removed,how do we fix that
space,removed,it is nice that indian government has a designated space program

space,removed,i feel like chris is about to explode space looks uncomfortable
space,removed,the short answer is that the material you imagine cannot exist because it would transmit information faster than the speed of light sorry
space,removed,it has to be truly a global effort not necessarily when america was colonized it was by a handful of the most powerful nations and through the course of many wars i see no reason it wouldnt be the same thing for a new planet as it was for a new continent hundreds of years ago
space,removed,i think that lightspeed engines would be great for us for more local reasons traveling to our own systems planets would be so much easier and something we could do all the time for interstellar and intergalatic i think lightspeed is a great step but hopefully we can create a warp drive eventually the vastness of space is so great that even light is almost inifinitesimally slow
space,removed,if i recall correctly the chinese invented gunpowder brought to europe by marco polo but they didnt use it to fire guns they used it to propel their arrows by stuffing this powder into cylinders it may have been an accidental discovery while trying to make flaming arrows who knows only to find that it would also make them go further but these may have been the first rockets of sort
space,removed,who said one nation on the contrary if only one nation had discovered america and kept it a secret colonization may have taken much longer but competitiveness for resources during times of war was a strong motivator as kings needed to feed their armies also the need for nations to prove their worth like the race to the moon between the usa and the ussr have also contributed to the advancement of space technology

space,removed,this is really cool can you do more planets
space,removed,you forgot millions
space,removed,i once read about the use of space pendulums my terminology to lift cargo into orbit essentially it is a satellite having two very long cables attached on opposite sides of the satellite the cables rotate and actually reach down to close to the earths surface as one reaches the earths surface it picks up the cargo when it reaches it apex in space it releases the cargo into orbit my description probably lacks clarity but i hope it gets the concept across

space,removed,does some random somebody have to be notified everytime some random scientist thinks he found one of the billions of random planets out there
space,removed,false the creator does not know where i am
space,removed,why would i complain about it and then read it
space,removed,pretty much every picture of earth is cgi composed and photoshopped were meant to believe that earth is a blue marble looking perfectly round and nasa has even said that they compose their pictures why havent we sent a probe or anything just to picture our floppy curvy homeplanet the we it really is im tired of these perfect photoshopped magazine cover pictures put our planet upside down and it looks completely different unfortunately were only used to the widelyspread look of it

space,removed,no youve captured very slightly more than half its contents alloting for rotation of the earth during exposure and bending of light via gravity literally what you said is the same thing as me saying that if i take a picture of the ground while jupiter is on the other side of earth then ive captured the whole of jupiter and its contents in one frame just because the diameter of the light cone the camera captured is wider than earth does not mean everything on earth is in that picture thats fucking stupid
space,removed,make space great again space is gonna be yuuuuuge i have many astronaut friends that tell me so if trump was actually devoted to tripling nasas budget i dont know what i would do
space,removed,if we went to the moon then why are you guys faking a far shot of the earth through a small portal window in the the space craft what a crock whether we went to the moon or not a tremendous amount of photography and videos were completely faked quite strange

space,removed,you like to repeat yourself youre in pain because of the men in your wifes life thats whats important here
space,removed,how soon can you get back to that planet
space,removed,no it isnt there is no asteroid mining there isnt even any asteroid prospecting luxembourg begs to differ the osirisrex mission to the asteroid bennu which was just launched is a prospecting mission even though nasa doesnt call it that but what else do you call a mission thats going to determine the composition of the asteroid and bring a sample back for analysis for asteroid mining to be worth anything at all there would have to be thriving orbiting factories which could turn raw materials into the fuel and spare parts you imagine sorry but you dont understand how it works the chondrite class of asteroids contain up to water as mineral hydrates and carbon compounds similar to tarry oilsands both of these can be extracted by heating to ie household oven temps this is easily reached by concentrating sunlight depending on your needs the water can be used directly as fuel in an electric plasma thruster if you need high thrust the water carbon compounds can be reformed to oxygen hydrocarbons using electrolysis the kind of reforming reactions done in oil refineries but at much smaller scale these are not complicated processes satellite parts would still come from earth as they do now what makes maintenance uneconomic right now is we dont have an affordable way to get the parts to the satellite with robot or human to do the replacement or alternately take the satellite to a maintenance base large amounts of low cost propellant solves that problem your thriving factories reduces to a couple of furnaces an electrolysis unit plumbing and pipes storage tanks and solar arrays to power the electrolysis and the usual spacecraft systems comms attitude control etc the level of complexity is about the same as a satellite upper stage and a manned mission to mars isnt likely to take us any closer you have it backwards a mars mission doesnt prepare for asteroid mining asteroid mining prepares for a mars mission by providing fuel and other supplies that otherwise have to be launched from earth

space,removed,so youre
space,removed,anyone see the comments below that article morons talking about how great it would be if we find oil on mars and how people would then find the funding to go get it and bring it back to earth how stupid can people be oil fucking bags of cut diamonds wouldnt be close to worth the cost to bring back oil holy shit i cannot stand it anymore

space,removed,nasa going for the guiness record for number of times water was discovered on mars
space,removed,well quit fucking around and go build a warp drive already were waiting on you

space,removed,thrown them for a loupe was this a swiss joke
space,removed,don is so adorably odd and so different from the typical astronaut image he is like that awesome but weird high school science teacher who doesnt give a shit at all about ego or imagehe just loves what he is doing
space,removed,i dont know if it was done or not but stars are much too far for us to reach with current technology so they are not where ships are being sent ships are sent to objects of our solar system and as it happens these predominately lie on the same plane so it makes sense to explore that plane first before anything else another consideration is that the speed of the ships we send out begins with the speed of our planet as it orbits the sun so it also makes sense to take advantage of this existing orbital speed and to send our rockets in that general direction as opposed to another direction that is either perpendicular or even worse opposite of it
space,removed,now that you have a hypothesis the next thing to do is to write down your equations and calculations so you can compare these results against recorded observations

space,removed,i dont think that you can establish a company located in space under the current laws debeers does not have an outpost in space youd have to have a headquarters on earth somewhere besides i think you underestimate the ability of various countries to put pressure on you legal or otherwise see kim dotcom i think your plan wouldnt work as easily or as well as you think it would
space,removed,no i do not misunderstand you i know that debeers engages in anticompetitive practices such as hording diamonds to inflate the prices i understand your point im saying they dont have a headquarters in international waters or in space they are headquartered in luxembourg diamonds are also not a commodity that has militaryeconomic value diamonds can be produced commercially to suit any militarycommercial needs theyre not truly rare you bet your ass if you had a supply of a commodity useful for a major countrys military such as oil that wasnt able to be replicated by industry such as oil youd have major countries very interested in influencing you in one way or another
space,removed,why not a microscope those things are used to make small objects like my pen
space,removed,see all the small water bubbles that actually leaves the wash cloth and his hands one bubble even hits the camera lens ive yet to see how they deal with this on the iss apparently on the mir there were multiple shortcircuits because of this they found huge blobs of dirty water on the backside of panels for instance looking at all the small experiments from the iss that include fluids there must be water everywhere theres a video too about washing your hair with karen nyberg and you can see water splashing everywhere even though im sure that there are ducts for catching water on the panels for instance what about water hitting random equipment like laptops its so weird that this seemingly isnt a problem at all i know i get a bit stressed out if i spill something in my laptops keyboard for instance imagine another even more sensitive piece of experiment yet no one seems worried about that

space,removed,lets think about that would it be easier to use joint efforts to engineer build and operate one space station that is a collaboration between nations or would it be easier to build space stations all separated by nationality why how about the feasibility of having space stations orbiting space junk is already a major problem there is no scenario in which building a space station for every country accomplishes anything positive or realistic why would the segregation even be desirable or in any sense fitting with the spirit of unity regarding space exploration and experimentation
space,removed,captain hows this the milky way if we are in the milky way

space,removed,congress wont even let him appoint a scj even though he had months left in his term the republicans have been bitching about him spending money even though he was mostly paying off the bills and debts of the last presidency how is this cognitive dissonance he doesnt have the money he doesnt have the political capital hes trying to create hype to lay the groundwork for a future president to get the funding needed thats not cognitive dissonance thats reality
space,removed,my brother every have sex with there girls they wants you now httpurlinmusicomkhum
space,removed,no they were the sacrifice
space,removed,what am i looking at
space,removed,sounds like a good business strategy shame that nasa is not primarily a logistical agency for low earthorbit activities actually thats a lot of very big words for trump and eloquently put i sense shenanigans or speechwriters
space,removed,this sounds like a brand new film series floridaman vs space
space,removed,how does he propose to fund this tax breaks to thee wealthy tax breaks to corporations he wont use defense money because he wants to fix our military cant use the money that will go to that new wall or the money spent to deport million people maybe hell sue outer space and gravity for unfair business practices
space,removed,the immediate economic impact of lost confidence in american democracy brought on by a trump win alone would doom any budget expansions for nasa neither candidate is being honest this late in the game this is just pandering for last minute votes dont be fooled
space,removed,its last minute pandering for votes something clinton does as well theres no reason to believe this is his actual platform
space,removed,yall trump needs florida to have any chance of winning the election hes pandering the shit out of himself to florida he has no intentions of giving a shit about nasa im certain that he has no idea what is being done to get us to mars
space,removed,turn back now ctr is already invading this thread
space,removed,there are so many cool possible names though meteora marspolis new warsaw olympus ultor
space,removed,literally of what comes out of that mans mouth is complete bullshit i dont know why i should take his words on space exploration seriously i really just wish he was just cut out of the media entirely all he does is lie and destroy the value of actual facts
space,removed,well need a good space program to get the fuck out of a world with trump as president
space,removed,too bad a lot of them cannot vote because they are bots
space,removed,rpolitics is just all biased people reddit itself has many trump supporters including me
space,removed,hes looking for alien pussy to grab
space,removed,nasa is a civilian agency like the irs or the cdc eisenhower made sure the agency had a distinctly non military bent while there is cooperation between nasa and the military nasa is separate from the military chain of command ie a general cant tell a director of mission control what to do and said director can tell them to fuck off and call security
space,removed,if i could vote this would be all it takes for me to vote trump then im thankful you cant vote single issue voters are the worst
space,removed,hillary says the exact opposite sorry of what specifically i want to make sure i understand what youre saying
space,removed,thanks for the demoralization shilling and thanks for admitting you have no argument im correct
space,removed,why most adults understand you cant cut taxes across the board and also increase government spending most adults realize drump just talks nonsense and has no real plan to follow through with his claims
space,removed,most of them on here are just trolls just ignore them
space,removed,for fucks sake i hope you can find a real job once ctr stops paying
space,removed,this cant be real
space,removed,were going to explore space and make the aliens pay for it
space,removed,i will take the chance to get as far away from this shit hole mostly to get away from trump
space,removed,trust me folks i know space i look up at the stars and love it and crooked hillary doesnt even know what the big dipper is can you believe that she will turn nasa into nation agency for hispanic astronauts
space,removed,trump supporters are too stupid to hand out in rspace is his point
space,removed,inspires and motivates others to hate and speak freely about it does not happen has not happened and displays high integrity and honesty about almost nothing you have no evidence of this meanwhile his life and his work stands as a testament to the opposite solves problems and analyzes issues with his own prejudice ignorant of the facts at hand you have no evidence of this drives for results to fill his own pockets wow a businessman drives for his business to be a success almost as though thats the fucking point you goddamn marxist communicates powerfully and prolifically to hear himself speak he is the classic narcissist and so this somehow equates to your original claim of moron in what way exactly builds relationships and tears them down do you not know how to run a business do you not know how to run a country explain why a foreign alliance or trade deal should be kept when it is no longer in the interest of a country therein ill wait displays technical or professional expertise about nothing presidential you have no evidence of this displays a strategic perspective to keep people who are other out so hes literally the perfect person to be the president of a nation do you know what a nation is develops others into a xenophobic frenzy displays an overwhelming tendency to lie about basic ideas you have no evidence of this should i go on youve yet to make a valid point yet or to prove any of your claims with even a single citation so yes
space,removed,is that really a sign in the back reading women for trump really
space,removed,hillary posted on this sub
space,removed,he is a deplorable what he said was just stupid trump supporters are barely people and they sure as shit shouldnt have a say in anything related to science for gods sake lol
space,removed,trump is a populist clinton is not i want politicians to be politicians and sometimes that involves lying and spinning yes theres a reason people dont want to see their sausage made
space,removed,the bad thing is that he most likely doesnt understand a single word of that sentence
space,removed,i wish it was
space,removed,what kind of fucking historical illiterate are you exactly do you know a damn thing about us history i mean a single fucking thing until we were isolationist the truman doctrine has been nothing but trouble if you gave a fuck about military expenditure youd be screaming to repeal it but it was passed by a liberal so you dont give a shit
space,removed,yup the wrong candidate supports space exploration
space,removed,i had to open the article and check that he actually said that that phrase is at a level far far above his speeches so far i think the people who came at his rally to yell lock her up must have felt like he was speaking a foreign language
space,removed,nitpicking intensifies
space,removed,ok
space,removed,and then selfdestructs
space,removed,pretty thorough breakdown of all theoretical possibilities
space,removed,faster then light travel
space,removed,faster than light
space,removed,when was this if thats just the moon we cant get an hd video yet come on man
space,removed,
space,removed,this video is private
space,removed,full retard
space,removed,why would you pay if you arent going to look through it
space,removed,they die
space,removed,but just in time to browse memes
space,removed,or walking on the sun
space,removed,soho nasaesa solar heliospheric observatory watched as a fairly bright comet dove towards the sun in a white streak and was not seen again after its close encounter may the comet probably part of the kreutz family of comets was discovered by amateur astronomer sergey shurpakov in this coronagraph the sun represented by a white circle is blocked by the red occulting disk so that the faint structures in the suns corona can be discerned interestingly a coronal mass ejection blasted out to the right just as the comet is approaching the sun scientists however have yet to find a convincing physical connection between sungrazing comets and coronal mass ejections in fact analysis of this cme using images from the solar dynamics observatory shows that the cme erupted before the comet came close enough to the solar surface to interact with strong magnetic fields
space,removed,dont be a fool of course this image is fake they even admit that an artist embellishes the colors and lighting why would you not assume the entire thing is fake did you take the photo did you build the telescope do you really comprehend how they send a signal through space over such great distances think with your brains before you discredit others with facts given to you by your authorities they say the sun is million miles from earth where the fuck is the sun in this picture i thought it was enormous
space,removed,none of them are real dummy its all a big lie just think how could they send a signal million miles away if we can see the earth in this photo apparently then why is the sun not its expected size of fucking enormous look at photos of earth over the past years north america is never once the same size when compared to all composite images in one photo north america takes up about of the entire globe its flat you fanboys the earth is flat and you continue to believe an organization that refuses to address air bubbles in all its space walk videos get real
space,removed,it would be a nice break from the when i think of the vastness of spacethe emptiness of marsthe sheer magnitude of the largest star as compared with our sun it really puts everything into perspective oh the significance of it all why wont i live long enough to travel through the mists of time surely that would make my life significant will there be a mass revolt on rspace against this stuff
space,removed,i appreciate the pedantic
space,removed,fairly new to reddit yr
space,removed,depending on composition internal magnetic eddie currents would also contribute a significant amount of heat
space,removed,more like comet penetrates sun sun orgasms
space,removed,is that thee sun
space,removed,that wouldnt work when a planet is discovered that happens to be closer to the sun they will be out of order nobody will remember the order of discovery just their order from the sun
space,removed,rwhoadude
space,removed,can someone add send nudes at the end of this
space,removed,in space there is no up
space,removed,perfect loop
space,removed,anyone else feel homesick while watching this
space,removed,this is amazing
space,removed,runexpected
space,removed,so what makes us think we are relevant
space,removed,play the album dark side of the moon by pink floyd with this looped
space,removed,absolutely not you mean that would be a violation of the cosmological principle there is just absolutely no evidence any physical laws or processes are different anywhere in the universe
space,removed,no were not fucking okay the news are more ridiculous than the onion
space,removed,very nice
space,removed,but we still cant see why kids love cinnamon toast crunch
space,removed,the situation was already absurd the us supporting unknown insurgency in syria same in yemen obama getting love by redditors and liberals while messing with peoples privacy and supporting both wars that i mentioned clinton wanting to get the us in a direct war with syria and literally paying us media to push for her etc but suddenly trump won and now its absurd whats worse is that you ask for a reason for people to think that trump is inherently bad and all you get are buzzwords
space,removed,im a scientist however saturn to me always looks ridiculous like how are a you real saturn with your rings all other solar planets are content being round but no lets add a fake looking ring on it
space,removed,how much worse than trump can it be
space,removed,nah things being pretty ridiculous is a fairly apt description even if you just went by a bare minimum measurement of the potus actually says these things on twitter it would be pretty fucking ridiculous
space,removed,can someone put googly eyes on saturn please hahaha
space,removed,kinda looks like a shark
space,removed,comment and gif belong in raww
space,removed,i read this as satan popping out
space,removed,hey champ you doing ok
space,removed,how was that taken
space,removed,wow
space,removed,comment
space,removed,bs so fake how does anyone believe any of this crap nasa puts out do some research on nasa and realize they are feeding you nothing but propaganda all fake bullshit
space,removed,psssst you kids wanna buy some moon rocks
space,removed,whats your surgical telescope
space,removed,pssstwanna buy some rings
space,removed,fuck em serves them right for attempting to escape their fate on earth
space,removed,its not saturn popping out its the moon moving out of the way
space,removed,wow beats all nasa images i have seen so far
space,removed,keep it down mexico
space,removed,looks like a fairing to me
space,removed,tell saturn were not
space,removed,looks like the moon is pooping saturn
space,removed,wow very sad what a good man
space,removed,even then saturn would no way look that big
space,removed,rip to those poor people
space,removed,tir saturn looks a lot like internet explorer
space,removed,like maybe a planet
space,removed,im fine get out of my room
space,removed,we are not saturn please send help
space,removed,we are not saturn we are not
space,removed,hey kid i was just asking
space,removed,why are two of them dressed in blue and not in orange
space,removed,can someone explain why dying make you a hero
space,removed,got it makes sense i dont understand the downvote though it was just a question p since challengers transcript was released for instance so that one survived the disaster
space,removed,they were unfortunate victims not heroes lots of people put their lives on the line for other people progress etc
space,removed,they went out with a bang
space,removed,hey saturn were fine some whiny liberal pussies have their cuckpanties in a bunch but thats hardly uncommon
space,removed,it clearly says rick and his name sounds like it was made up by a lonley catlady trying to claim she has a husband to some internet strangers on the spot oh my husbands name well its rick yeah his name is rick d husband totally nailed it
space,removed,i think we should build a monument to all of the brave men and women who died for mankinds advancement to space
space,removed,aliens
space,removed,um years ago
space,removed,my dad in satellite surveillance for cia spent my childhood bitching about how the shuttle was a giant waste of money and that the missions should have been carried out using conventional heavy boosters he was an asshole though and i didnt listen i was and will always be a fan and acolyte of the shuttle program
space,removed,are those waves of heat im seeing
space,removed,happy cake day
space,removed,i grew up with my dad who was in satellite surveillance for the cia constantly bitching about how the shuttle program was illconceived and should never have flown his assertion was that all the missions could have been done much more cheaply and safely with apollo era booster technology i never liked my dad i thought he was an asshole i love the shuttle program
space,removed,rick the husband
space,removed,they are not edgy just assholes the internets are full of their kind
space,removed,that is a duplicate
space,removed,hero a person who is admired or idealized for courage outstanding achievements or noble qualities i would say yes
space,removed,i wouldnt blame him
space,removed,he was just too mccool
space,removed,the closest earth sized planet is venus
space,removed,not a thing go to rtelescopes
space,removed,link
space,removed,my name is not riiiiiicckkkkkkk
space,removed,i knew the son and hes one of the most wonderful men ive had the pleasure of knowing he is heavily involved in the space program and even works on the side with the team thats testing the new motor the one that uses microwaves the mystery engine that that seems to violate the laws of physics hes also the guy first to identify the head and shoulders found on the beach
space,removed,i love the smell of my own fart
space,removed,science has discovered fart clouds i can die happy
space,removed,apparently a lot of geophysists in here lol
space,removed,why this is interesting i dont understand it whats so special about methane clouds
space,removed,it wasnt me
space,removed,in the queens english its actually meethane
space,removed,the reason is that wed be sending people presumably not shitheads unfortunately this particular planet has a plethora of them of course thats kinda what the video game bioshock had setup before everything went bad maybe we humans arent capable of keeping our shit together as a species i mean we still have people cutting off rhino tusks in the century is it that much of a stretch to have scientists wanting to press the reset button on a different planet
space,removed,well at least theyre not on uranus
space,removed,like shooting a bullet out of the air with a smaller bullet i took have seen star trek
space,removed,hehe cloud to butt plus at it again
space,removed,rtrees is leaking
space,removed,has someone made a fart joke yet
space,removed,say my name
space,removed,ok your way is way better
space,removed,vape clouds on titan
space,removed,
space,removed,i do have the current version for sale on etsy if anyone is interested
space,removed,they should change the name of the moon to methan or change the element to titane to make it more simple for people to understand
space,removed,imagine if most if not all manufacturing was done on titan powered by fuel cells using the readily available methane i wonder in terms of electricity how many ewh would be extractable with a efficiency fuel cell
space,removed,what if all of the methane was generated by farting space cows just let that sink in a moment meaning of life right there
space,removed,five times i have come across this post and each time i ended up reading methadone clouds on titan
space,removed,it even looks like how i imagine that many farts would look like still stunning though
space,removed,those must smell so bad
space,removed,usa builds intercept rocket silos all over europe nobody complains china builds an antenna in argentina outrage
space,removed,this photo is legit beautiful
space,removed,looks like a matte painting but its not fantastic
space,removed,well thats deflating
space,removed,they should call the attempt deuce bigelow
space,removed,haha technically kuiper and edgeworth predicted the existence of a belt beyond neptune my professor david jewitt along with jane luu were the ones who discovered the first kbo proving the theory
space,removed,lol you shouldnt use words at all world would be a better place
space,removed,sometimes theyre much worse—racist bigoted wrongheaded oh for the love of fuck he needs to shut the hell up
space,removed,i see a face in the cloud a face in space
space,removed,i still believe the saturn v is the most beautiful and absolutely bat shit crazy thing humans have ever created cern just a donut the internet just a web this thing is a building sized firebreathing obelisk that humans strapped themselves to and traveled to another world on and its gorgeous to boot reddit user uhugso
space,removed,the military and their love for initializations lol
space,removed,they do tend to do it a lot i already have bruh youre welcome to look
space,removed,it would take billion years before they can get out of the milky way and its only theory because the signal power would be infinitesimal then those waves were made to be local on earth they havent been broadcasted by billion of watts
space,removed,i was just about to ask
space,removed,actually your town is about to be destroyed by the death star
space,removed,youre goddamn right
space,removed,this pic was taken in imagine what they have now ughhhhhh
space,removed,i also noted that one of the two lines that supplied oxygen to my pressure suit had come loose and the other was barely hanging on if that second line had become detached at high altitude the deflated pressure suit wouldn t have provided any protection i knew an oxygen supply was critical for breathing and suitpressurization but didnt appreciate how much physical protection an inflated pressure suit could provide that the suit could withstand forces sufficient to disintegrate an airplane and shred heavy nylon seat belts yet leave me with only a few bruises and minor whiplash was impressive i truly appreciated having my own little escape capsule after helping me with the chute mitchell said hed check on jim he climbed into his helicopter flew a short distance away and returned about min later with devastating news jim was dead apparently he had suffered a broken neck during the aircrafts disintegration and was killed instantly mitchell said his ranch foreman would soon arrive to watch over jims body until the authorities arrived i asked to see jim and after verifying there was nothing more that could be done agreed to let mitchell fly me to the tucumcari hospital about mi to the south i have vivid memories of that helicopter flight as well i didnt know much about rotorcraft but i knew a lot about red lines and mitchell kept the airspeed at or above red line all the way the little helicopter vibrated and shook a lot more than i thought it should have i tried to reassure the cowboypilot i was feeling ok there was no need to rush but since hed notified the hospital staff that we were inbound he insisted we get there as soon as possible i couldnt help but think how ironic it would be to have survived one disaster only to be done in by the helicopter that had come to my rescue however we made it to the hospital safelyand quickly soon i was able to contact lockheeds flight test office at edwards the test team there had been notified initially about the loss of radio and radar contact then told the aircraft had been lost they also knew what our flight conditions had been at the time and assumed no one could have survived i briefly explained what had happened describing in fairly accurate detail the flight conditions prior to breakup the next day our flight profile was duplicated on the flight simulator at beale afb calif the outcome was identical steps were immediately taken to prevent a recurrence of our accident testing at a cg aft of normal limits was discontinued and trimdrag issues were subsequently resolved via aerodynamic means the inlet control system was continuously improved and with subsequent development of the digital automatic flight and inlet control system inlet unstarts became rare investigation of our accident revealed that the nose section of the aircraft had broken off aft of the rear cockpit and crashed about mi from the main wreckage parts were scattered over an area approximately mi long and mi wide extremely high air loads and gforces both positive and negative had literally ripped jim and me from the airplane unbelievably good luck is the only explanation for my escaping relatively unscathed from that disintegrating aircraft two weeks after the accident i was back in an flying the first sortie on a brandnew bird at lockheeds palmdale calif assembly and test facility it was my first flight since the accident so a flight test engineer in the back seat was probably a little apprehensive about my state of mind and confidence as we roared down the runway and lifted off i heard an anxious voice over the intercom bill bill are you there yeah george whats the matter thank god i thought you might have left the rear cockpit of the has no forward visibilityonly a small window on each sideand george couldnt see me a big red light on the masterwarning panel in the rear cockpit had illuminated just as we rotated stating pilot ejected
space,removed,heres the actual photo i found so i think the moon was photoshopped in the poster

space,removed,oh you havent spotted the flatties over at rconspiracy
space,removed,im from the uk id like to welcome you by asking you to kindly fuck off
space,removed,looks like the scrin hav successfully seeded the planet
space,removed,fun fact items reentering from orbit dont reach outrageous speeds because they are falling from great heights most objects terminal velocity from gravity is quite low the astronomical speeds that we see when things in orbit are reentering is actually due to the orbital speed being tremendous the entire time the shuttle is in orbit it is going about miles an hour as it drops into thicker air it experiences more friction due to air resistance which causes intense heat and actually slows the shuttle down as it falls back towards earth if a human were to be dropped from space they wouldnt get going any faster than a skydiver
space,removed,thats actually the sun the smog is just very thick
space,removed,kryptonite
space,removed,isnt this how day of the triffids started
space,removed,thats a dangerous and retarded mentality feelings are gonna be the downfall of the us what happened to everyone making fun of people for feelsreals if people feel like crime is up when in reality it has gone down you are playing on peoples fears and creating a monster that doesnt but i guess we reap what we sow

space,removed,if you squint and turn it sideways you can read the words death from above
space,removed,either a meteor or a pilot decided to fly home after a long night at the bar
space,removed,it looks like a drunk tried to write something and drew a shitty middle finger
space,removed,come on senior pilot its embarassing even the natives are able to pull off better landings than that with all due respect chief contact officer we just cant go for a straight approach over that area last time someone tried a few solar cycles ago we had to bail him out by trading natives integrated circuit tech you want them to have quantum computation too
space,removed,looks like an airplane pilot who had a bit too much to drink but seriously watching that must have been both scary and amazing
space,removed,httpiimgurcomjguvdesjpg made a shitty secetch of this amazing picture

space,removed,nasa clickbaiting again they have fooled me several times before it will probably be something orgasm producing for some planetary scientist neckbeard somewhere but to the average joe meh
space,removed,sorry but duh
space,removed,thats not a radio telescope that is a giant wok how else can you feed billion people a day
space,removed,my thought as well d
space,removed,they are winning when trump becomes president boy you are going to get tired of winning we are going to win so much that your head will spin
space,removed,so what dead people vote from the grave all the time

space,removed,hooray for our belgian light pollution although i think this is an older picture because we started to turn off highway lights a few years ago
space,removed,far lower i lived on some land for a while that had been clear cut and replanted about years ago and really got to see how this plays out trees that need a niche to survive are just barely coming back now as an example the cedars are just now starting to grow again around the massive stumps of their forefathers for some reason people think that if you chop down an old growth forest and replant a fuckload of fir trees all on top of each other that everything will go back to how it was but it just doesnt the interesting trees that remain or grow back are stunted and choked out by the fast growing replants the soil itself and all the mycological magic going on in it gets totally fucked by being completely exposed and unreplenished after everything is razed until we as a species begin to think ecologically about all this stuff were going to keep fucking things up only somewhat related but i was just in monterey and saw doc ed ricketts marine biology lab where john steinbeck used to hang out cannery row in any case both of these guys were putting this stuff together the importance of diversity looking at humans as one piece of a conected ecology etc way back in the and we still havent caught on in any case if youre interested in the history of this sort of thinking ricketts is a very interesting character steinbeck took his new at the time ideas of ecological interconnectedness and applied them to human relationships creating what i think are some of the most iluminating looks into intothe human condition culminating in east of eden theres also a great travel book called log from the sea of cortez that describes the two mens journey around the gulf of california to study specimens also of interest is that joseph campbell pioneer in mythology and comparative religion acted as ricketts assistant for a while got way off track there but all this to say that we should understand our effects on the planet by now and the danger of disturbing stable diverse ecosystems but we totally dont i am encouraged by the way thought seems to be going lately a lot more public attention on these concepts and innovations like biodynamic farming and aquaponics and stuff but weve got a long long way to go just look at the piece of shit fuckwad whos going to head the epa

space,removed,hmm i personally think that is a useless thought and wouldnt bother having thought like that clog up my intellegence but hey thats just my thought😕 personally i think you have a pointless comment and would advise that you remove it anybody with an iq of or higher would already think that anyone with an iq of or lower arent worthy of the thought remove your comment before the low iq people think they are smart oh i mean please remove your comment😊
space,removed,yeah that thing
space,removed,im not a dick its the truth thats hurting your little feelings many people with the profession you brought up are people of the low iq or lower so those people chose a profession that would best suite them a profession that they feel interested in dont you see their iq is strongly related to the profession they chose

space,removed,its true i work in a crisis unit and it becomes clear when its a full moon and i do not need to look out the window for proof tonight was just so wild that instead of full moon my coworker and i both said super moon as a joke its funny that it turned out to be accurate

space,removed,i would like to see one like this with mercury
space,removed,hero really for putting himself at such great risk the faked moon landings would never have happened otherwise
space,removed,what are you talking about
space,removed,i dont know the source picture mro archive is massive so searching by image is nearly impossible without knowing some cues but the source imagery from mro hirise cam are strips that are created by scanning the surface as the spacecraft moves above the surface in sunsynchronous orbit so that at every time theres the same lighting geometry these source strips are collossal they are available as jpeg images better compression than standard jpeg and the size of individual is counted in hundres of megabytes the mapprojected example i just downloaded is × pixels about half of which is actual image data irfanview went unresponsive for about seconds just displaying this
space,removed,i thought this was going to be a joke about mjölnir

space,removed,the evidence for accelerated expansion is at most what physicists call sigma sukar said according to physorg this is far short of the sigma standard required to claim a discovery of fundamental significance sarkar said other evidence suggesting an accelerating universe like the cosmic microwave background were all made under the framework of an assumed and unobserved model
space,removed,hes a police officer enough said
space,removed,you know how they say engineers dont really have any social skills thats pretty much the entire spacex subreddit communityunless you run with the pack they turn into joe mccarthy and suddenly everyones a communist so much for trying to ask some reasonable questions of them

space,removed,thats no moon
space,removed,and this site sucks at layout literally zero percent of the article is on my screen when it loads and im on a monitor thought it was some troll site cause its just a dancing astronaut
space,removed,to me the greatest evidence is that the soviet union went all damnit the capitalists beat us to the moon instead of saying its fake
space,removed,aeiou john madden

space,removed,i know there has been a lot of speculation on what would happen if you went through a black hole but what would happen if you had an erection while going through a black hole or would the black hole make it impossible not to have an erection obviously there is a great deal we do not know about space
space,removed,well what are we waiting for lets get him up there
space,removed,he is just being thorough in his search for the next miss universe
space,removed,need a new cabinet position so newt can be secretary of moon bases
space,removed,oh wow what will he say next d
space,removed,the donald doesnt just say things he has a theoretical degree in astro physics he has given this a lot of thought and personally designed a launch vehicle to execute his space plans and cant wait to built it its not like he just says random shit a president wouldnt do that s
space,removed,im responding to his comment you can bitch to him and yourself for the tangent and no all it would result is in a proxy war that doesnt require a victor andor economic ties being cut
space,removed,here comes the space race war for solace weaponization begins now
space,removed,you know if i had the ability to put a sattelite over your house right now i would nuke the fuck out of you and there would be literally nothing to stop me youre trivialising a problem people have been saying is a real problem ever since we started sending up satellites youre confusing military with all out war no the first causes the second theres not much in the way of confusion there all we know is that he wants to strengthen their stance in space why theres no reason to make space a tactical proving ground beyond escalating things to the next level but we still have a military presence all over the world and we have since before the cold war so the crimea and syria are just not on the agenda right now youre saying everything is hunky dory because noone ever wants to fight again why then is nkorea a problem or nuclear disarmament why are there still treaties banning space based weaponry why do these things even exist if militarisation of space is even a problem
space,removed,in
space,removed,and the rest of the gop
space,removed,national parks should be transferred for states to run them nowhere in the constitution does it say that the federal government can run national parks
space,removed,i was told space was yuuuge i dont believe it so were gonna check it out also were launching hillary into the sun and im putting a casino on the moon
space,removed,she has his anus
space,removed,make space great again
space,removed,can he go in person
space,removed,property belonging to the united states thats my point the national park land should belong to the respective states not the us government
space,removed,do you have any idea what you are talking about the voyager left the solar system in you seem to have the same understanding of our solar system as our current president it took years to reach interstellar space not
space,removed,are inventing a scenario built on nothing but assumptions justified assumptions based of his selfevident incompetency i dont think at this point you can honestly defend the contrary rationally yes im inventing a scenario we call this thinking but trump is unquestionably an intelligent person well shit son you just went off the deep end source of his tweets and public speeches sorry but im not going to be able to convince a guy whos committed to not seeing a snake oil salesman when he sees one
space,removed,we have the best space program dont we folks
space,removed,thats the joke but he couldnt word it with your anus
space,removed,indeed why politicians think they know better than the scientists is beyond me of course we should just be happy that trump hasnt claimed that the moon missions were a hoax like global warming and appointed a flat earther to run nasa
space,removed,i do hope he means personally
space,removed,they want to find this miranda planet seems like a bad idea
space,removed,scientifically he seems pretty ok wow speaking of spacewhat planet are you on maybe you missed it all these millions of times it came up but do you know his scientific view on climate change
space,removed,the moon is moving towards paragee its closest point to the earth it appears bigger because it is very close compared to our usual view httpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryperigee
space,removed,ok
space,removed,that joke almost seemed staged he set your ass up
space,removed,i agree with you on climate change definitely its just some things in life you just dont have control over like the election of the president i am not saying you dont have any control over climate change but i believe we realized we are beyond fucked when beijing has so much smog that people have to cover up their nose and mouth i am not hyperventilating because i accepted the fact that he is president its like working with someone you dont like there is a creature from spirited away called no face that gets stronger when people pay attention to it but once it is not given attention it goes weaker just go on about your life and accept this is shit out of your hands keep studying working being passionate and years will go by
space,removed,december is a nice month to travel donald
space,removed,is this a bit formatting is shit
space,removed,whoosh the sound of the joke flying over your head
space,removed,and the centaurians are gonna pay for it
space,removed,im just finding this out now thats pretty insane wheres the logic in that
space,removed,the new presidentelect also has plans to abandon climate research this is the catch
space,removed,sounds like a waste of tax payer money
space,removed,the iss looks like a tie fighter
space,removed,didnt it have chinese lettering on it
space,removed,my brother told me the antichrist is here😂😂😂
space,removed,if they had those green chicks from the original star trek id go there for them too
space,removed,space station i count tie fighters thats no moon the empire is coming
space,removed,trump the space marine of out age
space,removed,guess there is a silver lining to everything
space,removed,supreme leader trump is already rolling our his planetary defense system
space,removed,the iss is at on your scale the tip of the atmosphere is defined at km altitude the iss orbits at an average of km the moon is on average km away you want to calculate km km km
space,removed,trump is at least getting rid of the tpp which would fuck up the environment if it was passed
space,removed,yes
space,removed,send hillary too
space,removed,certainly looks like a tie fighter invasion lol
space,removed,tie fighter circles death star thats no moon
space,removed,i agree
space,removed,you misspelled tie fighter
space,removed,at though it could work but it would mean the government having to spend more time going through all that shit which would mean more people working for the government to make it happen which costs more and then its just a funding circle jerk
space,removed,amazing
space,removed,came here to say thisthanks
space,removed,star wars is real 🙃
space,removed,thats no moon
space,removed,oh was the supermoon lastnight cause it seemed pretty small to me
space,removed,thats not a moon its a death star look at those tiefighters
space,removed,awesome well done
space,removed,sooo where are the secret bases
space,removed,notallmoons
space,removed,waiting for your pics its cloudy in my town tonight
space,removed,why is your moon sideways
space,removed,rspace everybody
space,removed,glad to learn space travel beats fleshlights for now
space,removed,well then well never see eye to eye on this i think its a sign of progress and modernity that we arent allowing fools to sacrifice themselves for what they think or what others think is a greater good you want to talk cold hard logic we have a sample size of one only one instance where we can survive in the universe we have a comfy giant space ship right here that is perfect for us and weve only found death elsewhere in our available universe i know i know its incredibly backwards sounding especially to those riddled with engineers disease but there is something incredibly dangerous and seductive about the utilitarian justifications youre giving in the name of some spacefaring fantasy that you should damn well know is impossible not we just need a bigger widget impossible but physicserasing amounts of impossible like hitchens said i dont want the sacrifice in my name and if i was present at calvary i would have done everything in my power to stop it we dont want it we dont need it this is why we build our beautiful antlike robots and spread them out in our stead and this scifi reddit fantasy of sending humans out into farspace to fucking die is a remnant of a more primitive time so yeah well have to agree to disagree
space,removed,what type of banana banana is a terrible scale there are like varieties that are common world wide and the cycle out what type of banana are we talking about be more specific with your conversions

space,removed,can you assume the raddest points are the most distant
space,removed,its on this small blue planet near an average sized star on one of the outer arms of the milky way andromedas neighboring galaxy to be more precise
space,removed,i know the feeling i remember one night me and some of my friends and my dad were sitting around a camp fire talking about stuff someone asked a question about what they wished would happen after they die myriad of answers such as afterlife being reborn heaven etc mine was to see the future of the human race in its entirety i wanted to see if we ever made it out there and see what they would see lol my friends thought it was a weird answer
space,removed,the gold standard when it comes to reddit responses
space,removed,this is one of my favorite images of outer space hands down
space,removed,and yet the is only you in that entire picture
space,removed,think about it like this in the first million years after the big bang light would have travelled about a million light years but that distance has since expanded and today is quite a bit bigger than a million light years so when you add up all the distances that that light has travelled over billion years its going to add up to more than billion light years because the distance its travelled has expanded behind it
space,removed,heres hoping the skies will be clear that night
space,removed,our current understanding of physics allows for ftl travel look at the httpsenwikipediaorgwikialcubierredrive for example you dont necessarily have to move faster than light to get somewhere before light can get there
space,removed,how is that possible
space,removed,one dick for mankind and a giant anus for humanity
space,removed,was it really worth watching i saw it advertised but shuddered at the bad science but if the rest of the movie is really good then perhaps i should give it a try

space,removed,yay that spot where it gets whiter in north america thats me
space,removed,looks like earth is breathing warm out cold in
space,removed,yes but by complaining about shitty grey clouds we read it and it makes us sad little images of shitty grey clouds are floating around in the periphery of our mind so by distracting from that topic and steering it toward something abstract like the bounty of mans harvest vegetative growthhunger we can be happy again but then we go back and forth and by the time you reach the end of the line the last post mine or yours depending on if you the reader reply to me specifically or not if you reply im referring to you if not im referring to me its not a request just a conditional preparation based on a probabilistic outcome that im aware of based on previous experiences you forget that you were even typing in parenthesis and what the whole discussion was about fortunately you can appreciate the value of the discussion rather than the abstract symbols used to foster a medium through which the discussion may flow like etheraethermagic cough

space,removed,lmgtfy is gaining in popularity
space,removed,goes to moon to take pictures that look staged meanwhile they avoid every opportunity to advance research on the moon bring a telescope to take pictures of constellations nope better bring a land rover instead thatll make better television either nasa staged the landing or they really didnt want to collect data both realities seem disappointing in the science community
space,removed,nasa seems to think theyre dangerous we havent sent a single craft anywhere near the belt since
space,removed,it blows air on your balls when they get sweaty a lot of these were designed by the astronauts themselves
space,removed,technically there isnt a need to send people in space in general but if youre agreeing that traveling through the belt is an added risk astronauts dont need sure
space,removed,thats hilarious spend billions of dollars for a mission and all we have to show for it are pictures that can easily be staged not one picture of any star because nasa has deemed that impossible traveling to the moon possible traveling to the moon and taking a picture of stars from the moon impossible good job nasa seriously what specific piece of evidence proves we landed on the moon video of a land rover driving around a moon set is not enough for me
space,removed,not a real woman they never admit that their guy is right and real women certainly dont fart
space,removed,yeah but weve done that before right or have we evidence today seems to suggest we might have not which begs the question did we really land on the moon
space,removed,no you idiot the upper stage of a launch vehicle
space,removed,it is the upper stage of a chinese rocket reentering
space,removed,thanks for posting these but so far the experiments look just as easy to stage as a moon landing
space,removed,this is what saturn really looks like not the planet you guys think nasa shows you

space,removed,the earth is flat saturn is actually that hexagon
space,removed,yep reddit is full of fools
space,removed,that hexagon is what saturn actually looks like
space,removed,can we talk about how nasa is a freemason organization that worships the sun and makes many fake images
space,removed,because nasa is full of shit

space,removed,nice one
space,removed,and its also virtual reality headset compatible
space,removed,they have space engine which is now but still in early access i guess
space,removed,first of all its maple road secondly no this is not this is mile rd
space,removed,wixom so yeah detroit metro
space,removed,nice yeah ive lived here so long that i got to see the heyday of the plant when wixom was little more than a bar stop and when they demolished the plant it created like miles and miles of rubble it was the craziest thing
space,removed,is better than no mans sky
space,removed,didnt w bush say this too though until the shuttle launches i wont believe humans will go there
space,removed,im cool with that because that future was in a lot of was inferior to ours hoverboards id rather have the internet what the fuck is fax they were still using fax machines flying cars are stupid we barely dont crash on earth

space,removed,this is not a launch the spacecraft was launched back in march it is now arriving at mars and will land how can people get paid to write drivel like this
space,removed,httpsmyoutubecomwatchvjiduezqkyjo
space,removed,say i have an idea were going to need a butt ton of labor to build mars colonies all those rightwingers who hate immigrants for takin their jerbs can go to mars where there are no borders mexicans immigrants or muslims to upset them and we can have a peaceful planet again

space,removed,cocacola presents the iss
space,removed,this is the secondmost exiting thing i have learned all year
space,removed,advanced civilizations no longer use antiquated methods such as radio signals they use the force directly which as you know works through the dark matterdark energy interface and we have not even discovered either one of those yet so theyre not hiding and not in deliberate radio silence either they just use methods currently beyond our grasp
space,removed,yeah the movie got it all wrong it was obviously fake
space,removed,this is brilliant nice work
space,removed,dark matter is proven to exist by observing how light from distant galaxies is bent and distorted through what appears to be nothing so obviously something is there
space,removed,exactly
space,removed,so what enabled the development of these super zooms
space,removed,they need to pull his doctorate and send him back to school i guess there is no air because we cant see it right he alleges that the earth isnt round because if it was as it spins the water would fly off like a tennis ball lol whats the purpose of people hiding the flatness of the earth if it truly is flat thered be no benefit so the moon that you see in the sky is round obviously you can see this yourself proves there are round objects in space we see the sun it is round too we have sent craft to other planets and moons and they are round so why would the earth be the exception you hear his argument against gravity saying that theres no way this could be the case well whats on the other side of the flat earth what holds people on on that side and if the earth is flat like a coin and stands on its side what keeps everyone from falling off and if space is so big as big as we know it is then how are we oriented in space if the earth is flat if every object is flat why would they all be flat and round like a coin and why would every object be oriented in the same way toward the earth so we seem them like a coin
space,removed,excluding weather no theyre pretty accurate we know where the debris is we know our orbit and we know the moon phases it really is that simple i guess it does depend on where you are getting your prediction from whether it is overhyped or not here is the with predictions it will guide you well for instance january quadrantids were predicted to see zhr sightings suggest it peaked at

space,removed,reddit for very good reason has taught me never to get excited about this kind of stuff every time something revolutionary happens in science whether stated or hinted at its dismissed the next second next month it will be revealed the data was misinterpreted due to the local kite flyers club practicing in front of the telescope something ridiculous like this

space,removed,programmers never make misteaks they simply transcribe all the stupid shit the manager tells them oh you want us to use the imperial system instead of the metric system ok dont blame us when an algorithm breaks because you thought you were using metric system like the rest of the world of course good programmers can make their code failproof especially when majority of the users are idiots but there is only so much you can account for before a single invalid statement will break the code
space,removed,maybe im just overly sensitive to this because im sick of ancient aliens taking over the history channel

space,removed,actually in engineering fields overtime is a huge advantage as spacecraft to not magically stop operating on weekends hour workweeks are very common and are the reason level engineers are paid overtime the problem was that level engineers would be staffed for tasks that would take more than hours a week because supervisors knew they were cheap so level was granted overtime so unlike level they get paid for the full amount of work they do nbsp time card fraud gets anyone fired i was just noting that schedules are more fluid at jpl than at say your local supermarket on a given day you can show up at and leave at or and but clearly you would rather be antagonistic nbsp tldr you are wrong and you should feel bad because you are very wrong

space,removed,image of the
space,removed,you people are so dense a simple google search proves that hillary is for nasa quit lying to make your candidate appear better hes not
space,removed,im just calling it out when i see it uhstark blatantly lied in his post which is why i saw it fit to call him out
space,removed,you are being intentionally ignorant as president i will give my full support for a nasa budget that invests in innovative meaningful programs that are managed wisely and efficiently in order to grow our century space and aeronautics portfolio i mean the quote is right there there is no complete silence you are just choosing to plug your ears and scream
space,removed,no the republican dominated congress did the president doesnt establish funding
space,removed,like i said i am just calling it out when i see it i know there are liars in every walk of life but to lie on election day like that is abhorrent and a disgrace to democracy and the information age that we live in
space,removed,dont trust either one of the reasons trump has my support is because he doesnt ask for trust in fact he purposely does all he can to avoid it you have to analyze things yourself to determine his true beliefs you cant just assume hes who you want him to be i formerly supported bernie because i simply trusted him to be who i wanted him to be thats a mistake ill never make with a presidential candidate again that said i dont think these comments were lies i think there are three possible explanations the donald is passionate about space as pretty much anyone can be having billions of dollars cant make the moon much less impressive he knows the logical benefits of space travel like job creation technological advancement and a safer existence of the human race he knows nasa is a big stake in the key state of florida and that even in other states people who oppose space travel are not singleissue voters about it while many people who support space travel are i personally think its mostly the latter two but i think theres a dash of that first possibility in there because something about his personality tells me theres no way trump could have lived through the moon landing without catching some feelings about it
space,removed,yeah we have a lot in common most notably that we believe in climate change i am proud to say that is something that trump and i do not have in common among many other things
space,removed,yeah the entire thing of deleting accounts doesnt really help your case debating about politics when you actually support a candidate i do the same with all my posts but when you actually support a candidate it makes you look very shady in a perfect world you could just use one specific account for debating politicsbut in our world everybody would look at your history and see oh look hes just supporting this candidate and we have the same outcome i genuinly feel sorry for any supporter of any side in this election i cant trust any media from the us anymore so i cant know the truth about any accusasions its all rumours and oh heshe totally did that i dont have anything to say about no green energy funding and his bigoted vp because of this exact issue i just want cold hard truth but no media will give it its all money now not just media everything in the world is based upon money now the main developer of osu a rhythm game was recently found to be accepting money for unbanning players and posted a drawn dick in ms paint when confronted about it and got upvoted for it this world is just so sad and now im crying been thinking about killing myself for way too long no way we arent nuking each other in years anyways
space,removed,i was doing no such thing i simply refuted a statement and provided a suggestion one that was unbiased in fact whatever you assumed from my post is your fault not mine
space,removed,thank you for actiually voting
space,removed,you two stop you are doing exactly what drove the us into this nonsense uxerthernax tagging you aswell dont make my day even worse i couldve shut the hell up but now you two are arguing because of me rambling take it to pm if you have to
space,removed,it means she is looking to invest in programs that wont be a waste of taxpayer money it doesnt get much more succinct than that
space,removed,by the freshly elected democratic congress well see after today how viable that will be republicans are thoroughly against big government nasa included so even if trump and a republican congress get elected it would go entirely against their mantra to fund it significantly
space,removed,presidents dont increase funding congress does
space,removed,i think u can use a go pro
space,removed,whoosh dammit
space,removed,satellites
space,removed,this election in a nutshell what i think the other side has done makes him so worse that im voting for my side yeah just please stop arguing its pointless im disappointed that this entire situation happened to a country like the us i used to dream living there in my childhood
space,removed,the vote was for jerry brown
space,removed,and it shouldnt because thats not the presidents job it is congress
space,removed,you must be embarrassed by how truly little you know about government and how it works which responsibilities fall to which branch the president doesnt decide which direction nasa goes in it is congress that does that through their approval of funding
space,removed,that is because it is not the presidents privilege to fund and direct nasa that befalls to congress she is saying she will support a congress that supports nasa
space,removed,no way jose
space,removed,ahhh yes

space,removed,your photoshop skills are impressive astrophotography however leave much to be decided i think it is fairly apparent in that you repeatedly say you never meant to mislead anyone into thinking it was anything other than animation specifically you knowingly and repeatedly use the word animation in place of the word inaccurate youre not misleading anyone into thinking it is animation it is animated it is the depiction of motion through sequential images what people are mislead into thinking by your work is the direction and speed of the iss and mercury as they transited the sun literally if you spent a fraction of the time as you must have in photoshop just making a gif from the frames of the video i would think that rspace would have a higher bar for acceptability of an image such as this as it is apparent from the commentary that most people will see this and accept it as unaltered video and will not have any idea of your admission that the speed and directions of the elements iust took artistic liberty and did what i thought looked best it does not bother me so much that you did this your time is yours to spend but what bothers me immensely is that seeing this image in the context of rspace the vast majority of the audience will either see this and take immediate issue with it or see it and accept it as reality as a guy who spent hours on his rooftop observing the transit in my telescope that just frustrates me no end because the transit and the simultaneous iss transit are remarkable in their own right and do not need artistic license to be improved upon in my opinion after guessing an incorrect speed and direction for both objects you might as well have replaced the iss with an actual tie fighter for all the good it would have done you now couple all of that with the paramount fact that the original photographer expressly stated any use of one of these images other than strictly private must be subject to prior authorization from legaultastrophotofr and your jovial artistic license has in the end taken away any artistic integrity the work you generated may have had

space,removed,i would suggest that you get involved in any of the space advocacy communities from httpsedsorg httpnssorg httpsspacefrontierorg to httpplanetaryorg each of these groups has local chapters meet ups national and international events and they all have active participants who are often the ones you read about in the space news there is a lot of cross fertilization between these groups nasa and other agencies and the various industry participants if you want to do more school consider getting your msc in space studies at httpwwwisunetedu in my experience a lot of the folks ive met at conferences many if not most working in new space companies are graduates from one of their programs you will come out of their with valuable knowledge and strong connections to folks who are or will be in the industry literally every student there from all over the world intends to work in the business and to help make space development happen they put their money where their mouth is the isu campus is in strasbourg alsace france which is close to germany all classes are taught in english

space,removed,here is a good video by a grade teacher hilarious
space,removed,all theoretical likely we dont fucking know it is said to traverse between our planet and venus or the sun but during its passing it is said to latch onto our magnetic field stopping our spin around the sun we will still be spinning it will just be different i honestly cant tell you how the big thing theorized is that when it pulls itself off our magnetic field it could possible cause the magnetic pole to shift and could also cause sometype of weird effect during the magnetic lock it is possible our magnetic field could depress against the earth literally pulling the atmosphere down almost like a balloon that has another baloon in it that is earth and you flatten the first balloon against the second one but you do it enough that the first one is bulging up like the earths exterior being exposed to the vaccuum of space it would also permafreeze any biological life havent we found large mammals before that have been nearly flash frozen the other part of this is that when earth escapes nibirus hold it will likely cause a magnetic pole shift this is all theoretical

space,not_removed,that is utterly fantastic the away makes scale so difficult to judge but it doesnt matter such bleak starkness hurtling through the void at speeds the mind can barely comprehend i cant wait until we start mining the shit out of comets and asteroids
space,not_removed,nothing like i expected the waitstaff were nowhere to be found not a drop of water in sight absolutely desolute and terrifying of would go again
space,not_removed,thats one big achievement to get such clear image of an asteroid from such close quarters wish humans were there toolanding on asteroid and doing the science shite
space,not_removed,amazing is there any scale available how big would a human be compared with one of those rocks edit the image scale is about cmpixel and the image measures about m across
space,not_removed,and now the craft has been put on a collision course with the comet it will crash at a speed under one ms i guess that is because the comet has low gravity and they dont want it to bounce off into space also it arrived there over years ago really doesnt seem that long
space,not_removed,if i were to pick up a random stone on the surface of this comet and throw it upward would it be able to reach escape velocity and leave the comet forever
space,not_removed,our entire school sat down to watch the livestream the last few minutes were so intense
space,not_removed,that is just this is the future i wanted to live in where wed see stark images of the surfaces of comets rather than idiots in congress refusing to release funds for zika research our species is struggling with whether to spring into unimaginable wonders ahead or lurch backwards into darkness i hope we make the right choice thank you to all those who made the rosetta mission possible you blew my mind
space,not_removed,it looks like the surface is covered by sand and small rocks how are these created if not by wind or water to break down smaller stones and boulders
space,not_removed,trying to wrap my stupid head around the fact that this is not just another computer rendition of a comets surface but an actual photo from a fucking comet
space,not_removed,does anyone know what those little specks of light are all around the asteroid
space,not_removed,how are we able to see it so clearly is it light from the sun like visible light or some other part of the spectrum
space,not_removed,so cool imagine some other species someday stumbled upon this comet in the same fashion that us humans did only to find remains of some extraterrestrial technology
space,not_removed,im not meaning to sound ignorant just curious but what knowledge have we gained from philae and rosetta i cant believe its been two years since they arrived there i remember watching livestreams and reading all about it when it landed and the troubles it went through after but what did we walk away with
space,not_removed,looks like a hollywood studio set proof thatset designers are awesome
space,not_removed,explain like i am why arent we have pictures of the moon that are clear like this
space,not_removed,i mean its literally a mountain floating through space suspended in nothingness crazy as hell
space,not_removed,when they rendezvoused it wasnt going at speeds we cant comprehend it was actually around a couple thousand miles per hour
space,not_removed,right the whole comet is close to km at its largest point twice the width of manhattan
space,not_removed,even better the gravity on that asteroid is one wrong jump and youll never get back
space,not_removed,this is nothing like the hell scape the movie armageddon and deep impact had me believe
space,not_removed,for reference google earths highest resolution for select cities is cmpixel and is cmpixel for most other places
space,not_removed,escape velocity is only ms based on this calc about how easy it would be to try to walk on the comet so yes small stone would be easy
space,not_removed,it kind of feels a bit sad doesnt it
space,not_removed,yeah it looks kind of like erosion youd see in a canyon on the desert i have no idea but geologists must be having a blast looking at this and space geologists too
space,not_removed,well that totally failed looks like i dont know how to reddit
space,not_removed,weve got some that come close but i dont think weve sent anything to the moon in awhile
space,not_removed,giant boulders that you can probably roll around large rocks you would be able to pick up if you wouldnt sink into the gravel up to your waist
space,not_removed,certainly it was a comparable magnitude to the difference between the earths surface and orbital speeds hardly incomprehensible
space,not_removed,didnt know that thats a little faster than the average speed of a bullet when fired
space,not_removed,jump i am afraind to tiwtch my nose it is so tiny and yet it looks like a moonscape to me i always pictured strange erosion no weathering uhhhh displacement patterns go with that displacement patterns making it more swiss cheese or pumice than painted desert i am godsmacked by the image being so terrestrial it is almost surreal
space,not_removed,okay so the scariest environment imaginable thanks thats all you gotta say scariest environment imaginable
space,not_removed,theirs was a huge mettalic meteor though and crystalline
space,not_removed,could a flea jump off the cometassuming it didnt boil into a flea soup
space,not_removed,definitely it actually felt like a funeral for rosetta
space,not_removed,and with a precise enough throw could you lob a rock into orbit edit
space,not_removed,well its tombstone is a giant rubber space duck so cheer up
space,not_removed,i realize now that the title could be written more clearly these are all uncopyrighted nasa images used by astronomy picture of the day apod in their calendar heres the pdf version and the pptx in case you want to make changes using a printing service like fedex should result in a legit calendar
space,not_removed,if you ever go to space
space,not_removed,ive been wracking my brain and chasing down a couple ideas but the closest i can think of is maybe the block d kerolox upper stage used on proton it has a fairing and is fueled on the pad but i dont think it counts for what you want because it ejects the payload when its done then passivates every satellite i could think of or even esas atvs that use storable propellant are fueled before integration sorry
space,not_removed,thanks i really appreciate it im working on a design project and couldnt find any examples
space,not_removed,so guessing by youre username youre part of this team or know something about them whats actual real world use for such an engine
space,not_removed,as someone who knows very little about rocket science how does the power of a hybrid rocket compare to current rocket booster technology used
space,not_removed,those restraints took a bit of a beating
space,not_removed,this is the official warr reddit account were developing a sounding rocket with a hybrid rocket engine hybrid rocket engines showcase very unique safety features and were considered as an alternative propulsion method for the space shuttle boosters
space,not_removed,designed correctly they are usually comparable to kerosene liquid engines so they compare well in the performance department while they have safety improvements over liquids and solids they are trickier to design they are optimized for boosters and sounding rockets where you can get good safe performance for low cost once you start putting them on spaceships like virgin galactics spaceship one the problems of hybrids start to manifest like most things in life they have specific applications at which they excel but other applications where there may be more optimum solutions
space,not_removed,we are a student group from germany that is building and developing rocket engines for over years a few years ago we began to expand our activities and are now also building satellites space elevator concepts and are participating in the spacex hyperloop pod competition
space,not_removed,hybrid in what way
space,not_removed,thanks for your reply cheers and god speed
space,not_removed,apparently spaceship two broke up because of the feather system not the hybrid rocket
space,not_removed,so i know this is tangential but since this should be a pyrotechnical unit of significant size did you need to have pyrotechnicians on scene
space,not_removed,hybrid as in using a combination of both solid and liquid propellants in this case the oxidizer is liquid and the fuel is solid which is referred to as the classical hybrid rocket configuration
space,not_removed,hybrid rocket engines use a solid fuel and a liquid oxidizer most other rocket engines use either liquids or solids only
space,not_removed,that is true however they have hybrid rocket issues as well that is the main driver for their flight test delay in the timeframe they kept changing their fuel formulation and geometry
space,not_removed,the crash had nothing to do with the hybrid propulsion but it cant hit its intended performance hybrids are cool but have a low technology readiness level and need more time in development like what op is doing
space,not_removed,we started the engine with a selfmade pyrotechnical device with a mass of g so we dont need a trained pyrotechnician to operate the system
space,not_removed,what was the highest isp and highest theoretical isp
space,not_removed,the isp of htpb lox in vacuum can be as high as s since we couldnt expand to the optimal pressure of bar on this test we could only reach about s of isp in this test it will get better as soon as we have our bigger engine
space,not_removed,sounds wonderful so this can legitimately replace solid rocket boosters good luck to you guys
space,not_removed,spectacular i enjoyed zooming in on the smaller galaxies in the background
space,not_removed,a long time favorite the absolutely massive one of andromeda they released a few years back is amazing too iirc you need like hd tvs to display it at full scale edit is the one i am talking about pixels
space,not_removed,soooo many galaxies hopefully well meet neighbors in ours then in others
space,not_removed,i love the two on the bottom left touching each other
space,not_removed,i wonder what it would sound like pressed as a vinyl like those companies that press tree rings into music tones on vinyl
space,not_removed,this cassini image features a density wave in saturns a ring at left that lies around km from saturn density waves are accumulations of particles at certain distances from the planet this feature is filled with clumpy perturbations which researchers informally refer to as straw credit nasajplcaltechspace science institute read more at
space,not_removed,youd need one humongous needle i can tell you that much
space,not_removed,it would probably sound a lot like white noise i guess
space,not_removed,itll play a message for god humanity will be able to evolve once it can decide the hidden message from each planet the egyptians didnt die they evolved to a higher state they have already decided earth can we catch up
space,not_removed,curiositys camera cant record videos and even if it could that would be one of the most unexciting videos ever nothing moves on mars its a completely dead planet it would all be a still landscape and the rover itself travels very slowly and often stays in one place for multiple days while its scientific instruments do their work so even the landscape wont noticeably change during the stream you could watch a video for hours and it would look like a static image
space,not_removed,i think it only sends back images and then every minutes or whatever
space,not_removed,it would be cool of they started adding video to all new probes and you could switch between them
space,not_removed,it would be cool but bear in mind the rovers only uplink static images and not continuously maybe something to think about for a future mission
space,not_removed,imagine the panic when the martians finally appear the gubmint needs to keep their secrets it would be fairly boring
space,not_removed,nothing moves on mars eh literal tons of micron sized dust does in fact said dust ruined some missions to mars mars and mars for example ultimately failed because a dust storm had covered the entire planet and lasted for quite a long time mariner arrived around the same time and hung out in orbit till the dust settled but mars and mars didnt have that option its a completely dead planet not a known fact
space,not_removed,i thought it was a live video feed the website says its offline right now i thought it was just recharging its batteries until the the feed came back on heres the site httpwwwustreamtv
space,not_removed,boring maybe for some but id play it in the background which is how i watch most tv i colored and made a lenticular print of a mars landscape just a bunch of rocks and dust but when i tell people its mars it really piques peoples interest and not just my nerd friends you maybe underestimate human fascination with other worlds
space,not_removed,i think it would be pretty neat and if they had one on the moon you could flip back and forth
space,not_removed,martians dont exist pretty much any tv show is more boring
space,not_removed,was your comment at all necessary his point is that a live stream from curiosity would be painfully unexciting it seems like you just wanted to be confrontational or prove someone on the internet wrong too much of that on reddit
space,not_removed,no curiosity does not transmit a live video feed data from curiosity is typically sent in minute relay passes via the mars reconnaissance orbiter and mars odyssey it also is almost never video but engineering data science data and static image and honestly there really wouldt be anything to see apart from the sun moving across the sky and shadows moving timelapse worthnot live video worthy moreover the rover simply doesnt have the capacity to transmit live video anyway
space,not_removed,i just want someone to make an interactive landscape for vive hnnnghh
space,not_removed,was your comment at all necessary when untrue statements are made yes because this is the internet and people are likely to believe that as absolute fact check the sub daily look at some of the questions asked many that stumble into this sub ask questions that should be covered in elementary school and sometimes absurdly bizarre questions like have we hit the end of the universe because they see someones hare an onion article on facebook and believe it to be actual fact
space,not_removed,well seems like a good time to install snapchat i had no idea nasa had a snapchat account
space,not_removed,they post all the time on instagram including lots of instagram stories recommended
space,not_removed,hi this is mandy blahblah i am an intern here at nasa working on blahblah video ends im glad we have it but so far i have found it mostly boring although todays was good
space,not_removed,atlas v launches are easier to see because of the vapour from the srbs you should be able to view falcon launches on a clear day but they are slightly less impressive they launch from the same general direction check the side bar for the launch schedules
space,not_removed,the composition of the fuel and the combustion chambers atlas leaves a wider and initially a dirtier plume than falcon which uses nine smaller engines and has a tighter plume than atlas
space,not_removed,this cluster is billion light years from earth this means we are looking at what a cluster of galaxies looked like billion years ago correct this is what blows my mind what that cluster looks like today we will never know we will only know what this looked like what this cluster was doing billion years ago and there will come a time when we wont be able to see it at all because of the expansion of the universe when applying this to exoplanets if we are looking at a habitable planet thats very far away closest one may be approx light years away and we dont figure out how to travel faster than light by the time we arrive it could be completely differentin the time it takes to get there there could have been significant asteroid impacts volcanic eruptions runaway greenhouse disasters and we would never know because we can only see the planet as it was in the past
space,not_removed,there seems to be some conflicting information on that actually but it seems like there has been images of the fairing in the ocean though it hasnt been recovered per se i know first stage recovery and reuse is the headline and definitely the biggest single cost saver of a fully integrated falcon but the fairings are a huge resource drain not only does each half cost approximately million but they also take up a ton of space in the hawthorne manufacturing hq because theyre baked in a giant furnace like structure called the autoclave and that also takes about weeks two weeks also happens to coincide with the currently scheduled launch cadence which means something will have to give and hopefully its not the launch itinerary fairing recovery has been said to involve autosteering parachutes which was confirmed today also confirmed today is that it also uses thrusters to either propulsively slow down or steer the fairing what wasnt known was how they would be landed in the ocean means salt water which isnt good carbon fiber other predictions included on the asds alongside the first stage the most daring although eventually debunked by musk prediction is that they would follow ulas smart vulcan engine recovery method which involves snatching the chuted engines out of the air with helicopters however it looks like spacex will attempt a much safer and easier approach just a big squishy landing pad no need to fly helicopters out to max range or to engineer a parachute system since gave up on parachuted first stage recovery so long ago im sure they know the woes exciting times i hope we get more information on the development on the landing pad soon in the coming launches next spacex launch is scheduled for april and itll attempt a a rtls landing should be enough time to inflate a big bounce house if they get their biggest lungs on it d
space,not_removed,source
space,not_removed,at least we in the us can do a days travel to get that view i feel sorry for the eu folks
space,not_removed,i drove a few hours to go camping somewhere in the dark green region recently it was totally worth it coming from one of the bright white spots
space,not_removed,wow what a coincidence im over in parma and my girlfriend and i were just talking about trying to find a place to see the stars more clearly
space,not_removed,what about canada seems pretty close
space,not_removed,portage lakes has an astronomy club
space,not_removed,this is not what i was looking to post i meant to post the description and the design
space,not_removed,link to idea
space,not_removed,neurosurgery resident here we already have surgeries for treating the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid csf caused by other conditions classically we use a ventriculoperitoneal shunt which basically shunts csf from the brain to the abdomen via a tube that runs under the skin its a very common procedure that we do that may be used to prevent this condition if we set a valve that could consistently shunt an appropriate amount of csf while the astronaut is in space
space,not_removed,this article makes me kinda sad hopefully somebody much smarter than i can figure out a way around the vision loss and brain damage from long term space flight
space,not_removed,we really need to start developing space shuttles and stations meant to rotate for simulated gravity i am still very surprised we are still doing months of weightlessness
space,not_removed,you could make artificial gravity through rotating the ship to create a centrifugal force
space,not_removed,i feel like this is a prime example of how dangerous space is it will take than a few rockets and wishfull thinking to truely survive every caution must be accomadated for
space,not_removed,would the shunt still function to draw excess toward the abdomen in microgravity
space,not_removed,this is fascinating its could be a procedure everyone would need to go through before doing a long term zerog mission
space,not_removed,if you know how it happens you can make sure it does not happen apparently they now know how it happens
space,not_removed,centrifuge it doesnt have to be a ring it can be a crew module on the end of a long cable and a counter weight at the other end i dont think they need to get to though
space,not_removed,hopefully somebody much smarter than i can figure out a way around the vision loss and brain damage from long term space flight looks like someone had the answer for you two hours later
space,not_removed,yes this is because gravity is not the force driving the csf from the patients ventricles to the peritoneum but rather the pressure differential of the intercranial pressure being greater than the peritoneal pressure
space,not_removed,i think you have to be hooked up to a dialysis type machine that drains fluids and replaces it with less pressurized fluids duringspace travel
space,not_removed,we better hope they dont need mars colonization wont be feasible if we cant live under less than g without constant medical intervention
space,not_removed,that seems complicated but at least there is a way to fix it
space,not_removed,fluids dont come in different pressures that you can just switch out
space,not_removed,how do you launch that thing on top of a rocket though if it will be assembled in orbit then that will cost billions
space,not_removed,i will volunteer to be the guinea pig in this endeavor😁
space,not_removed,maybe it could be an inflatable habitat that is doughnut shaped
space,not_removed,we dont need torroidal centrifuge we can even use two strapped together on long line and some electric propulsion to make it spin electric means high isp so you can stop rotation when you want to dock i think its not impossible we just need long line that will be strong enough to keep that two modules together under the force we dont need i guess
space,not_removed,thats the kind of thing well need to learn to build in orbit long term plans and long term missions are going to need newer infrastructure up there
space,not_removed,sonething like that would have to be assembled up there thats not impossible
space,not_removed,sure but we will do it on earth and not in space are you still volunteering now
space,not_removed,still you need a large circumference and fairing size will limit the payload it could have a meter circumference maybe
space,not_removed,dont forget that itll need a strong structure strong enough to hang itself from at current beam and modules are very much designed for microgravity so thats a whole chunk of work to do
space,not_removed,if you are mobile user dont even bother clicking this nothing but pop ups ads and forces redirects to other ad websites
space,not_removed,without much detail i think most of the iss research has been focused on space travel and its effect on human health
space,not_removed,my understanding is that the majority of the research on the iss deals with bioastronautics as well as certain aspects of matter behavior in zero gravity for example crystal growth or flame propagation in space however nasa does generate a large variety of research that is used to advance our technology both on the iss and on earth the agency puts out an annual magazine available for free which details many of the advancements that it has achieved during the year the magazine overview can be found here httpsspinoffnasagov a pdf of the magazine can be downloaded for free here hope this helps
space,not_removed,i mean i just googled iss experiments httpwwwnasagovmissionpagesstationresearchexperimentsexperimentsbynamehtml
space,not_removed,are people really that bad at google
space,not_removed,ive noticed that people seem to be divided into two groups those who will google when confused and those who will ask another person the former group tend to be resourceful people who generally like to think for themselves and are good at researching determining the relative value and reliability of any given piece of information while the latter group tend to just want someone else to do it for them the fact that httplmgtfycom is a thing shows how bad many people really are at google i once had a colleague whip around at her desk and ask me hey what time is it in hong kong right now i was flabbergasted what were the odds i wonder of me being able to answer that off the top of my head without googling vs her being able to find the answer herself in google you could argue that it would be faster assuming i already knew to just ask me in reality i didnt know off the top of my head so she now interrupted her own work and mine to ask a question that she could have easily answered herself why ive spent years asking it going through that scenario and my only explanation is that these people dont want to be selfsufficient they want someone else to show them how to do it for them forever and ever they dont want to be selfreliant they want to be taken care of i have nothing but utter disdain for that kind of person
space,not_removed,i read somewhere once that people who ask others those kinds of questions arent looking for answers but rather looking for conversation i feel like there are better ways to do that though
space,not_removed,initially read that as superman was disappointed then mildly awed
space,not_removed,httpmathucreduhomebaezphysicsrelativitysrrocketrockethtml is a complete derivation and computation of this
space,not_removed,non relativistically this is easy acelleration is g v g t in seconds x g t now the hard part is the relativistic part which anyone seriously doing this will likely avoid as the thrust required to increase speed will approach infinity as c is neared however until till of c you can probably mostly avoid that also you want to slow down when you get to the other end so the classic trip is accellerate at to the halfwaypoint turnover the ship and then decellerate at until you reach your destination the cruise phase with no accelleration is adjusted to match the distance you need the equations for doing this relativistically are beyond my ability to type them in to this editor box but mathematica is your friend
space,not_removed,this has to do with one of my favorite graphs check it out constant acceleration round trip times the associated wiki also has some useful math httpsenwikipediaorgwikispacetravelusingconstantaccelerationexpressionsforcovereddistanceandelapsedtime realize though that constant acceleration is kind of a hard paradigm to reach conservation of momentum means you always have to be throwing something out the back when your accelerating this would be hard to maintain for years or decades at a time
space,not_removed,on another note i dont really understand your table the first two rows seem to contradict rows three and four are you sure you did your math right check here httphyperphysicsphyastrgsueduhbaserelativtdilhtml also the large magellanic cloud is about ly away not
space,not_removed,i was camping with my boy scout troop at snow canyon state park in southern utah the previous day we had been working on our knot tying merit badge we created a ft tall tower out of wood poles tied together at the joints to demonstrate our knowledge and the strength of knots we got up early and all climbed onto this tower to see the shuttle streak across the southern sky the sonic boom was unlike anything i had ever heard such a surreal experience made even more so upon hearing of its disintegration later that day
space,not_removed,i was in grade and my school arranged for all the classrooms to gather in the gymnasium where we all sat in rows on the floor to watch the first teacher go up in space on a big projector screen i dont remember my reaction when it actually happened but i remember clearly filing into the gymnasium and then afterwards our teacher saying that our guidance counselor was available to talk to anyone who felt they needed to i dont know if i went into shock or what i dont remember anything in between
space,not_removed,and to think that it had less computer processing ability than a modern smartphone
space,not_removed,and that burning patch of ground frankly if i had to choose between columbia and challenger id go columbia all day at least you got to see space
space,not_removed,i was in high school was actually sick running a fever the day it happened i stayed in bed and watched news coverage and remember sean okeefes i think news conference on what nasa thought had happened
space,not_removed,lock the doors remember hearing that and my guts just turned over
space,not_removed,swishing around in my dads bollocks for year
space,not_removed,youre referencing challenger right
space,not_removed,this article is so badif youre interested in the subject just go on wikipedia
space,not_removed,spacetime expansion which is related to but a separate thing from inflation is proportional to the distance between objects it causes things like large galaxy clusters to move apart from each other as they are hundreds of millions of ly apart however for two galaxies as close as the the milky way and andromeda the mutual gravitational attraction of the galaxies overwhelms the spacetime expansion
space,not_removed,no the effect of gravity outweighs space expansion over small distances
space,not_removed,i like how the definition of short distance is different in space as opposed to a short distance on earth
space,not_removed,for green stuff you want this famous thread which produced httpsenwikipediaorgwikipeagalaxy and yes the person who started that thread is the one who discovered
space,not_removed,i apologize for my ignorance but there is no such thing as a bad question what do you mean by stellar relic what am i looking at here
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,no need to apologize at all your question is a good one i used the link to get my title from my understanding the glowing part in the middle is the remnant of a dead star that went supernova long ago
space,not_removed,the crab pulsar psr is a relatively young neutron star the star is the central star in the crab nebula a remnant of the supernova sn which was widely observed on earth in the year discovered in the pulsar was the first to be connected with a supernova remnant thats from wikipedia cause i was too lazy to type out an answer hope that helps though
space,not_removed,false color to be sure the image you linked is an artists rendition the actual hubble image is the animated gif a bit further down in the linked article httpiimgurcomprocmkigifv very cool nevertheless
space,not_removed,more like elon musk has proved that its important to stay focused and get the job done the most sensible way possible instead of trying to make a rocket reusable with exotic materials and an airplanelike fuselage he builds conventional rockets and adds just enough hardware to reuse them
space,not_removed,and proves renewable rockets are the future of space exploration no is it possible yes is it economically profitable given the sacrifices costs and risks at least for chemical propulsion the jury will still be out
space,not_removed,mach is about breaking the soundbarrier that doesnt exist in space so the only think you have is miles per hour that doesnt matter if it is in a vacuum or not
space,not_removed,the speed of sound is a meaningless term in a vacuum and therefore all mach numbers are also meaningless miles per hour is independent of the medium
space,not_removed,speed doesnt depend on air pressure what is the context of your question
space,not_removed,not terribly fast thats slower than orbital velocity at earths surface let alone any altitude low earth orbit stuff goes at mph for comparison
space,not_removed,mach depends on the speed of sound in a given medium
space,not_removed,the earths surface spins at approximately mph
space,not_removed,sure but op gave the speed in mph
space,not_removed,yeah mixed up some numbers i was thinking orbital speed at earths surface thanks for noticing
space,not_removed,photoshop horizon too blue sun is white not yellow cant see stars due to suns brightness
space,not_removed,earth from photoshop you can tell by the pixels basically if you can see the stars and the sun at the same time you know the picture has been doctored
space,not_removed,i like how they used a fisheye lense to make it look like earth isnt flat s
space,not_removed,while it may not be a real picture its pretty damn close and looks really good
space,not_removed,i dont really care if its fake or not its only relevant based on the subreddit you posted it in a more appropriate place for posts like these in the future is under rearthporn cheers
space,not_removed,silly the earth is flat anyone with awellno education could tell you that
space,not_removed,this reminds me of the earththemed music visualisation on the hot dang i wish theyd bring that over to as a dashboard theme or something
space,not_removed,well the sun is yelloworange when its light being so the rendering isnt completely off in that regard
space,not_removed,im pretty sure its not photoshop doctored but entirely artist rendered
space,not_removed,omg i thought this was real
space,not_removed,its about time to wake up
space,not_removed,unfortunately i dont know much more than this but my grandfather was on the boat for one maybe more of these pickups for the apollo capsules too pretty neat if thats what this is im not even sure
space,not_removed,the document in the second image clearly states apollo twelve also see
space,not_removed,reminds me of what a customer told me once due to me wearing a nasa baseball cap she told me she almost married one of the jump men who used to jump out of the choppers not sure what era of apollo mission but she had fond memories usually when anyone mentions the hat i talk about kerbal space program lol
space,not_removed,i hope you dont mind but i thought you might want some colour on it i know its not perfect but thought you might like it httpdemosalgorithmiacomcolorizephotos
space,not_removed,could very well be that helicopter is part of a squadron flying off the uss hornet which recovered both the apollo and apollo command modules
space,not_removed,thats cool
space,not_removed,the article states an international team of astronomers using hubble have been able to study stellar evolution in real time over a period of years dramatic increases in the temperature of the star sao have been observed now the star is cooling again having been reborn into an earlier phase of stellar evolution this makes it the first reborn star to have been observed during both the heating and cooling stages of rebirth
space,not_removed,boca chica naturally manufacture the mct hardware at the launch site
space,not_removed,what the heck is rigil same thing as rigel the group aims to decide which traditional star names from cultures around the world are the official ones in order to avoid confusion the iau said in the statement mission not accomplished
space,not_removed,me also me you bastards itll always be alpha centauri to me
space,not_removed,if alpha centuri and proxima centuri are a binary pair how is proxima always closer to earth
space,not_removed,they avoided confusion in the same way of that occasion when they decided that some large round objects orbiting the sun are definitely not planets and named them dwarf planets im starting to think that the iau is some sort of troll cabal
space,not_removed,the iau has made a list of official names for some stars but these stars still have designations in other catalogssystems alpha centauri is still alpha centauri if youre going by bayer designation the httpswwwiauorgpublicthemesnamingstars releasing the new official names still has the bayerflamsteed designations as the first columns in their table you can chose whichever system to refer to a star that you want
space,not_removed,dumbest thing everit is alpha centauri and that is what its gonna be forever
space,not_removed,in another development the international astronomical union has been renamed to a bunch of mindless jerks wholl be the first against the wall when the revolution comes
space,not_removed,why dont we rename sagittarius a the supermassive blackhole in the center of the milky way every time i say the name in my head i immediately think but its not a star how about chronus
space,not_removed,yeah im just going to go ahead and keep calling it alpha centauri
space,not_removed,i actually like this particular change epsilon eridani is now ran much less of a mouthful
space,not_removed,renaming stars is not progress but worthless endeavor in microbiology they went thru a spate of that years ago and then stopped it al it did was to create confusion and messed up the taxonomies a rose by any other name would smell as sweet renaming stars is a waste of time it doesnt contribute one iota to improving our knowledge of astronomy its empty of value and point
space,not_removed,rigelrigil comes from the arabic word for foot rigel is the foot of orion while rigil kentaurus is the foot of the centaur also ive seen rigel kentaurus being used
space,not_removed,rhymes with vigil
space,not_removed,to make it worse the star system itself is still called alpha centauri so you have alpha centauri which consists of rigil centaurus alpha centauri b proxima centauri
space,not_removed,the decisions to reclassify pluto had merit and reason this is arbitrary and a bit confusing
space,not_removed,alpha beta and proxima centauri form a triple system with alpha and beta close together and proxima orbiting much farther away and therefore more slowly
space,not_removed,theyre not a binary pair rigel kentaurus alpha centauri is a pair wikipedia says proxima centauri may form a third component of the alpha centauri binary star system but at a separation of ± au its orbital period is likely greater than years
space,not_removed,except that there was confusion – namely why is pluto the only one of hundreds of small rocks with odd orbits that is a planet if pluto gets to be a planet why is ceres excluded
space,not_removed,the funny thing is that in the article the iau say they want to put more emphasis on the colloquial name of the stars but rigil kentaurus is colloquialy known as alpha centauri and the colloquial name has become little more than obscure trivia also correcting people by saying actualy alpha centauri is a designation the name is actualy rigil kentaurus is downright silly no way astronomers start to correct the public on that
space,not_removed,so its even more useless and confusing
space,not_removed,luckily the stars themselves dont give a fuck
space,not_removed,the editorial department would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over the position of space correspondent
space,not_removed,so will anyone with any sense
space,not_removed,i know what rigel is i dont understand why they think changing the spelling of it will make it less confusing especially when arabic vowel pronunciations are so varied sounds like they just got bored and decided to stir up some chaos
space,not_removed,my dad always pronounced it like ryejuhl thats the incorrect pronunciation handed down by the british who also mangled latin pronunciation but at least its familiar and if theyre trying to transliterate an arabic word it should be rijl after رجل arabic doesnt have a hard g sound but they do have a j sound but then if they did it that way i guess the dutch would pronounce it ryeyuhl theres a gh but thats more like the french r
space,not_removed,so at some point in the future proxima will be at the aphelion and alpha and beta will alternate as the closest
space,not_removed,at the time there were two competing views at the iau a people who thought that planets should be defined as bodies that clear their orbits and b people who thought that planets should be defined as any body orbiting the sun large enough to be spherical both definitions are consistent perhaps b even more so because clear their orbits httpsenwikipediaorgwikiclearingtheneighbourhooddisagreement personally i think that it would be far better to say dominate their orbits under b the solar system would not have eight planets but rather httpsenwikipediaorgwikidwarfplanetdwarfplanetsandpossibledwarfplanets with possibly many others to be added as they are confirmed to be spherical one can notice that ceres would be included so wheres the confusion
space,not_removed,it doesnt really come directly from arabic though
space,not_removed,yep alpha and beta centauri will be the closer stars after próxima for the most time in the next thousand years barnards start wont get to the position of being closer only ross and gliese will steal some thousand years to alpgabeta centauri and after that ross will get some
space,not_removed,yes unless another star like barnards star gets closer in the interim but it the centaurikentaurus system should remain the closest for at least a few hundred thousand years
space,not_removed,i dont think aphelion is the right word in this context but i dont know what that word would be
space,not_removed,both a and b are consistent neither a nor b were the definition before the decision was made before the decision was made pluto was a planet and ceres and the other dwarf planets werent thats the confusing point under b the solar system would not have eight planets but rather thirteen thirteen today hundreds in the near future with better detection capabilities maybe even thousands
space,not_removed,next years the scale on the xaxis is thousands of years so alpha will be closer than proxima starting in about years
space,not_removed,i wanted to say thousands of years but i derped bad thanks for the correction
space,not_removed,i mean we must have some good idea chemistrytemperaturemixture and so on its fair to say we dont know exactly why but this doesnt seem odd considering the size and makeup of saturns atmosphere
space,not_removed,simplethe death ray is now finally warmed up itll be aimed at us shortly
space,not_removed,just take a few nukes with us wherever we go and we should be fine
space,not_removed,wow thats even smaller than the role i have in my daughters life
space,not_removed,just accept that his candidate won and move on we have all been there
space,not_removed,jesus those nikon and the lenses are like porn for me space camera porn
space,not_removed,how often would they typically require a reboost and what variables might affect this frequency
space,not_removed,i want one of those lenses but they cost damn near as much as a car
space,not_removed,i hope the camera was recording when it was floating towards the camera
space,not_removed,iss altitude it descends about due to drag
space,not_removed,next goal create a rocket that doesnt collect condensation so we can watch it land
space,not_removed,it wouldnt need that just a camera with a lens wiper
space,not_removed,apparently this is debris from burning paint and its happening far above the moisture levels still a kind of condensation i guess but thought that might be interesting
space,not_removed,alright there buddy lets keep things a little more realistic what you want a worm hole generator too while were at it
space,not_removed,didnt we do that already
space,not_removed,generate a wormhole or windshield wiper cameras
space,not_removed,wormholes windshield wiper cameras are way too advanced
space,not_removed,i think weve created a magnetic wormhole but not a spacetime wormhole
space,not_removed,yeah i know i saw that we created a wormhole and my friend started yelling about how were going to make a wormhole and teleport to the nearest nebula and harvest its resources it was kind of infuriating because even if any of that is possible we wont be able to do it for a long time
space,not_removed,im just waiting for the day where i can control a personal rocket launch from my smartphone wormholes can wait a little longer
space,not_removed,its such an inauspicious end to the modern marvel of human spaceflight isnt it days spent in a billion dollar space station and it ends sitting in some garden chairs wrapped in blankets in the middle of a scrubby field like grannies come to watch a ploughing contest after this picture was taken one of them got out a tupperware box of goat stew
space,not_removed,is the dude in the background about to slide down some sort of childrens slide set up over the capsule
space,not_removed,do you think they have them sit for a while like that so they can get used to gravity again after being in space for months it must feel really weird to be on earth again and actually put effort into moving around
space,not_removed,why dont they do water landingsor why did the us do water landings
space,not_removed,both rubins and onishi look very jovial whereas ivanishin looks like someone bought him megablocks for his birthday instead of legos
space,not_removed,is there a way to get a sweet russian space blanket without going to space like if you had a valid application such as playing video games in a cold house
space,not_removed,the russian looks so happy to be safely back where is vodka comrade
space,not_removed,that tiny capsule had all three off them that must have been cosy i take it there is not shower either
space,not_removed,probably a pretty stupid questions but theyve illegally entered a country right cant they get arrested for that like if i just fly into a country visaless and parachute out its surely not allowed or do they apply for a visa in advance if so what kind like i said stupid question probably
space,not_removed,jesus ivanishin is looking like such a badass he clearly must have been inhabited by an alien and is now evil also google autocorrected badass as nasas
space,not_removed,dude in the middle looks like the well meaning scientist turned evil by space goo that he now carries inside of him
space,not_removed,why is it that the astronauts tend to land in that part of the world central asia is this preplanned or does that area have some significance
space,not_removed,do all the astronauts land in the same field or does all of kazakhstan look the same
space,not_removed,little do they know one of their crew has been turned by the dark side
space,not_removed,without reading the title i thought this was some astronauts that came to aid in blocking the oil pipeline silly me
space,not_removed,can someone start selling these roscosmos blankets please id buy one
space,not_removed,do the pods land randomly or is there some sort of target i mean isnt there a risk of say us astronauts landing in countries such as iraq or syria or landing in dangerous conditions
space,not_removed,the guy in the middle looks like hes practically fuming maybe he wants to go another round
space,not_removed,who else is thinking hm more minutes and it would have been sunday even though it has no relevance to the post
space,not_removed,is it me or are both a man and a woman in competition for kates love
space,not_removed,it is an interesting dichotomyshows just far weve come and yet how much farther weve yet to go
space,not_removed,when there are no roads you gotta limit your equipement
space,not_removed,what kind of gardens do you visit that have space chairs
space,not_removed,i thought astronauts had to be quarantined for a period of time after returning from space or is that before departure only
space,not_removed,yeah its to help get the astronauts down gentler they introduced it a few years ago i think
space,not_removed,they have a medical tent as well to do on field checks ect to make sure they are all good after they land especially with the year mission after that they had to be in the medical tent for a couple of hours because they feared problems the us astronaut after arriving back in the us was saying how the pain increases over time and that his skin was painful so i guess the first sitting down period is to let the astronauts feel the gravity and state if they have any serious and immediate problems
space,not_removed,chris hatfield wrote about it and explained it really well many changes happen to human body because of long exposure to lack of gravity that even lifting your arms is difficult at first
space,not_removed,could you imagine how much stuff they break by just letting go it in the air once they get back to earth
space,not_removed,their muscles atrophy in space even with all the exercise they do so they pretty much cant move much when theyre back on earth dont know how long it takes to get better probably a few months
space,not_removed,i wondered the same thing my theory same as you was the adjustment period i also thought it might just be a procedural precaution like how you always leave the hospital in a wheelchair no matter what
space,not_removed,from a technical point of view it doesnt really matter that much the usa does water landings for now on mercury gemini and apollo simply because they have the ocean near the launch sites the ussrrussia does land landings because they have a massive flat area of land near the launch sites i think dont take my word for it soyuz capsules are actually capable of landing in deep water as well
space,not_removed,take a look at a map of the world and tell me what you notice about the availability of coast line to each nation the orbit that russian craft enter is unlikely to pass over suitable water landing areas they need to land close to russia once for secrecy reasons also land is cheaper you need some dudes with trucks and helicopters and that is it water landings are easier engineering wise to land on the ground the soyuz needs landing rockets splashdown does not require this
space,not_removed,look at the background of the picture that is one shitload of nothing
space,not_removed,a spacecraft cant sink in a desert and russia has far greater land mass and much less population density than the us so landings made more logistical sense to them
space,not_removed,the term water landings should be replaced with waterings
space,not_removed,motherfucker looks like a goddamn bond villain
space,not_removed,mega blocks scariest shit ive heard all halloween
space,not_removed,i love the contrast between them and kate the stoicism and the cheer i wonder if there are some cultural differences at work because i seem to recall that can see the same thing with obama and putin in a lot of their public appearances together
space,not_removed,well with the latest soyuz launches doing a fast track approach to the iss the astronauts dont spend huge amounts of time in the tiny capsule from a quick search the time up is hours and the time down is
space,not_removed,have you watched gravity its not the best movie but it shows well how small the soyuz capsule is also the visuals are stunning
space,not_removed,yeah its fascinating to see how small the capsule actually is they do have a bit more space in the orbital module which gets separated before landing theres no shower not even on the iss by the way but at least theres a basic toilet in the orbital module
space,not_removed,chris hadfield actually answered this in an ama not too long ago nasa kept our passports and visas and brought them to us at landing so we had them at the karaganda airport to leave kazakhstan a funny but necessary detail of returning to earth source
space,not_removed,russias space program is still based in kazakhstan due to the whole soviet union thing kazakhstan is also very very friendly with russia
space,not_removed,i live kms away from kazakhstan we go there by car no visas no passport control whatsoever these three guys just have chosen the fanciest way to get there baikonur is kms away though as far as i know you can buy tickets to watch a launch not sure why i havent been there yet
space,not_removed,considering they launched from russia im sure they had a proper visa squared away
space,not_removed,its the russian landing zone it a few hundred km from the baikonur space centre they have all their helicopters ect in a area they take off the capsule begins to fall and the helicopters follow it plus the army style all terrain vehicles also its really flat no aircraft movements ect so its a perfect area this is a very good nasa behind the scenes of the mostly russian operation when they prepare to land its a general area because they cannot control where they will entre
space,not_removed,kazakhstan is the location of the baikonur cosmodrome where the russian launch their rockets they use this location because it is closer to the equator and provides a slight velocity boost as the earth moves faster near the equator this is also why cape canaveral was chosen by nasa this video helps explain things
space,not_removed,all of kazakhstan look the same
space,not_removed,ha i actually thought thats what it was also when i saw the small photo before enlarging it and seeing the subreddit
space,not_removed,obviously its not random what if they landed on a mountain certain death if it landed in a wrong place also you have these people waiting for astronauts on the ground with equipment and doctors landings are definitely calculated of course there is some error but these flats or ocean is big enough not to worry about it
space,not_removed,nothing is random when it comes to space flight other than human error perhaps
space,not_removed,its probably a pretty small area that they could land in if you think about it we had ballistic missiles decades ago that could target cities so our reentry vehicles should have at least similar accuracy
space,not_removed,nobody brought a frickin hamburger no wonder the middle guy looks pissed
space,not_removed,though the fact that an american spent all that time with the russians landed in a fairly soviet country and will return home without issue also kind of says weve come quite a ways
space,not_removed,thats not what dichotomy means
space,not_removed,well consider this what if he was piss drunk the whole time while he was learning to fly a helicopter it would actually be more dangerous if he was stone sober now
space,not_removed,i think that was from the old apollo days when they actually went to the moon and we had no idea what might come back with them
space,not_removed,thats an old thing from the first forrays into space where they were worried about space diseases being brought back to earth overlooking gravity altogether acting on any spaceborne bacteria or virusesthese days its a recovery period and medical assessment for the effects of low g and space radiation
space,not_removed,i think it was only apollo that was quarantined as a precaution
space,not_removed,they also use them for emergency situations in commercial aircraft i think itd make a funny bit people jumping down and laughing after surviving a horrifying accident or maybe its already a bit and i just remember the premise and claimed it as my own idea
space,not_removed,i cant even really grasp what he means by that because im so used to gravity even when they put those planes into a dive to experience weightlessness they are still experiencing gravity pushing on their body sounds interesting and bad at the same time lol
space,not_removed,it must feel very stupid after a while dropping stuff and then thinking oh yeah right gravity i mean there are a handful of cosmonauts that spend over a year at a time in space there is no way that they didnt pick up some bad habits in that time
space,not_removed,thanks for the info can you imagine that for a little over months you actually know what its like to be able to fly and then you come back to earth and you cant fly anymore
space,not_removed,which is one of the most important research areas for the iss figuring out how to get folks to mars in the physical condition to build shit is a big issue
space,not_removed,so they pretty much cant move much when theyre back on earth thats not true at all they can even walk even if a bit unbalanced all the carrying around and support is mostly a precaution
space,not_removed,that would be correct they can land in water too didnt go too well but mainly probably because it was unplanned
space,not_removed,why is the launch site location a factor in the landing isnt this many days after the launch
space,not_removed,yep all these astronauts land near zhezkazgan kazakhstan im originally from that city in a village not far away at all and my parents would tell me how they would see all the launches from the baikonur cosmodrome my dad was even responsible for collecting some of the material from the rockets when it landed back around the city
space,not_removed,the steppe is a beautiful place
space,not_removed,i like how the horizon is a bit curved makes one think that the earth is not flat after all
space,not_removed,texas new mexico arizona nevada are a bunch of nothing too is it because theres so much private land in the us landowners would try to sue nasa
space,not_removed,my russian colleague says that russians avoid smiling because your are presumed to be an grinning idiot without serious thought the more serious you look the more respect you get so yes definitely a cultural difference
space,not_removed,its an american thing to constantly smile at things especially at people wtf are you smiling at me for i dont know you
space,not_removed,russians are much more straightforward about emotions we smile when we happy laugh when something bad happened to america someone told funny joke frown when dissatisfied etc while americans seem to smile all the time
space,not_removed,nah he just didnt smile thats all stoicism hedonism existentialism you cant judge it by the smile
space,not_removed,i love the contrast between them and kate theres only one russian cosmonaut in that picture and onishi seems like hes smiling too
space,not_removed,theyre probably just going through reconditioning to the earth and are super fucking hungover feeling she just looks glad to be back on ground
space,not_removed,kate is happy to be back on earth the cosmonauts are thinking fuck we landed back in russia area
space,not_removed,the latest launch used the old route where the astronauts spent days in the capsule before they docked with the space station
space,not_removed,many folks have actually recommended that one its on my list
space,not_removed,they launched from kazakhstan as well considering that baikonur cosmodrome is what russia uses for its space program edit uomskcamill is correct fixed
space,not_removed,thanks ill watch it later today
space,not_removed,theres also the fact that you can only directly launch to higher inclination orbits than your latitude launching to lower inclination orbits requires a course correction after launch which uses extra fuel
space,not_removed,oh ok thanks i just wasnt sure how accurate the landing area would be but that definitely makes sense
space,not_removed,i think hes severely culture shocked
space,not_removed,middle guy wants to go home
space,not_removed,definitely historically that is a huge leap forward still sad to think though that as a specieswe havent stopped killing each other long enough down here on earth to really make any big progress in so many areasaerospace science environment etc etc
space,not_removed,hmm there may be a better word to describe my sentiment in the english language though dichotomy is the best i came up with of top of my head httpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionarydichotomy seems like it could be used two oppositecontradictory thingsin this case the highly advanced technologyknowhow to go to safely go and come back from lowearth orbit next to the very decidedly lowtech garden chairs in a scrubby field but would be interesting to know if theres a word that captures this idea thoughprobably is
space,not_removed,verrrryy nice you like
space,not_removed,are you triggered
space,not_removed,yes its well known as the zero gravity uterus syndrome
space,not_removed,probably not given they experienced gravity the entire time they were in the womb
space,not_removed,babies cry if theyre tired hungry or uncomfortable in need of a diaper change otherwise they mostly just sleep go indians
space,not_removed,iss isnt outside of earths gravitational influence those weightlessnessdives are the same as being on the iss relativistically speaking
space,not_removed,the iss is basically falling endlessly around the earth its the exact same as the planes diving iss not outside gravitational influence
space,not_removed,that is exactly how orbit works though when something is orbiting earth its not just going in a big circle around it its constantly falling and missing earth but a little less extreme than how it sounds
space,not_removed,we studied it in school being in space for one day was the equivalent of laying in bed without moving for either a week or a month muscle atrophy is one of the bigger issues faced when entering gravity again im pretty sure they wouldnt be able to walk in that picture pretty neat stuff
space,not_removed,yes i can i have never been able to fly on earth without wings
space,not_removed,from your link the landing marked the final splashdown of a manned spacecraft to date thats quite interesting
space,not_removed,it is and in theory it does not matter if the landing site is close to the launch site in the real world however it is simply nice more practical to have the two close for human emotional reasons where we like to complete journeys think of the hobbit there and back again for operational reasons theres overlap in personnel for launchlanding its always practical to keep any operations as small scale and uncomplicated as possible for political reasons you dont want your space thingy to land in an area you dont control edit its even more obvious for the space shuttle orbiter most flights ended with a httpsenwikipediaorgwikishuttlelandingfacility near the launch site thus requiring only a simple shuttlepullingthingytractor to drag the thing back to the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiorbiterprocessingfacility for other landing locations an infrastructure with two single purpose httpsenwikipediaorgwikishuttlecarrieraircraft plus a lot of associated equipment and personnel had to be available
space,not_removed,the horizon looks curved because of the wide angle lens
space,not_removed,wait must be a trick of the light
space,not_removed,there are large amounts of federally owned land from new mexicocoloradomontanawyoming all the way out to the west coast so i imagine its for operational reasons
space,not_removed,no more likely the epa cant have the capsule landing on some spotted shit beetle
space,not_removed,maybe americans are just happier in general
space,not_removed,american im going home russian fuck this is home japanese i failed to defeat gravity i have dishonored my family
space,not_removed,i dont know which astronaut but somebody said that those days beyond the very limited space window are actually pretty great nobody from the ground bothers you and you can look a lot at earth
space,not_removed,its not like their brains are wiped im sure they still understand the practical implications of geopolitics
space,not_removed,baikonur is a cosmodrome launch site iss is the space station the cosmodrome is in kazakhstan but is rented by russia therefore saying its russia and its kazakhstan is both correct
space,not_removed,its awesome he goes though all the events from when they start preparing to get to the landing site from getting information about the deorbit burn about the possible landing zonesareas ect its a really good insight
space,not_removed,not to mention the fact that all astronauts are checked on their social compatibility with basically all humans and the fact that they are at a minimum trilingual with russian being most definitely in their repertoire also if i just came from a space station i could think of nothing better and to sit on the huge kazakh plains and just enjoy the fact that i cant see the edge of the world every time i look out of the window also a real meal sounds fantastic
space,not_removed,this video will give a bit of perspective on how far weve come when it comes to violence
space,not_removed,are you kidding its when we are killing each other that we make the most progress war brings out the most advances in all fields you stated above alone explains a lot going on in the image were talking about
space,not_removed,yeah it hurts my heart sometimes to think about what we could have done if defense budgets worldwide had been turned to education and science
space,not_removed,theres nothing wrong with your use of the word dude
space,not_removed,i like to go with zgus for short
space,not_removed,youre right they experience of earths gravity i never realized that does that mean they constantly have the sensation of falling and just get used to it
space,not_removed,i bet you learned a lot of cool things when you were in school to give you a hint of how old i am when i was in school they just taught us that pluto was a normal planet we didnt learn much about astronauts we didnt even learn why the challenger exploded but we did get to listen to nirvana when they first came out
space,not_removed,yeah and if they came by car to launching site it wouldnt make sense to land far away because parking meter would keep ticking while they travel back this way space travel can stay as inexpensive as possible
space,not_removed,ahh so it still might be flat
space,not_removed,i didnt even think of that lots of protected cactus in the southwest
space,not_removed,i found that most americans are really good at small talk
space,not_removed,its from the fake happiness that is expected from everyone in the service industry that has become the norm in everyday human interaction many countries dont have that thats why you hear american horror stories of incredibly rude waitresses or hotel staff from their eurotrips even in denmark the happiest place on earth people smile laugh clap and otherwise express their joy in a less extrovert manner
space,not_removed,or maybe we really are all grinning idiots
space,not_removed,theyre both good and very different
space,not_removed,gravity has a lot of factual inaccuracies but its not a bad film it gets the idea of nothing across and shows you how tiny all their capsules are
space,not_removed,what that movie blew me away interstellar is good too but everyone dick rides that movie on reddit so whenever gravity is mentions someone just has to say how better it was
space,not_removed,well some do report having changed views on life its called httpsenwikipediaorgwikiovervieweffect
space,not_removed,baikonur is still ours so they launched from kazakhstan
space,not_removed,after space food goat stew would be great
space,not_removed,i imagine being back safe on the ground must feel pretty good
space,not_removed,ha thats a good pointwarfare did drive lot of innovationsinventionsmaybe it is a phase that most intelligent species have to get through
space,not_removed,we wouldnt have nuclear power if we didnt want to kill of japs at one time
space,not_removed,that was pretty astounding thank you
space,not_removed,that video really puts things in perspective i dont care much that the narrator attempts to correct some perceived revisionist history about the atomic bombs
space,not_removed,that makes me sad that we advance when we want to kill each other hopefully we can advance that tribal pettiness
space,not_removed,that doesnt mean youre not experiencing what gravity feels like its just that your weight load is distributed evenly across your entire body just like when youre swimming in seawater for example gravity doesnt just magically disappear when youre suspended in a fluid
space,not_removed,being in amniotic fluid not experiencing gravity
space,not_removed,its all about your reference point technically theyre always falling in reference to earth but since their craftshipstation is falling witharound them they cant tell that theyre falling its the same way that driving works when youre hurtling down the highway you dont really feel the speed you only feel accelerationdeceleration because your surroundings the vehicle are moving with you
space,not_removed,essentially yes as they are indeed always falling experiencing gravity but in freefall as they do is to an astronaut in all ways indistinguishable from experiencing no gravity at all if such a thing was possible its not
space,not_removed,they are being pulled by of the gravity they would be on the ground but so is the spacecraft theyre in so its like being in that plane or a lift falling in its shaft the trick to orbit is to go fast enough sideways to miss the ground
space,not_removed,high school didnt teach me that a good professor at uni did and i was a little too young to enjoy nirvana and man am i jealous of that although if there were one man i could go back and watch live i love the guitar solo in this song he died before i could truly appreciate his music and ever get a chance to see him live
space,not_removed,yes parking fees are often overlooked in aerospace
space,not_removed,you cant see the curvature of the earth at that altitude its too minute
space,not_removed,or maybe this is just a snapshot of a single moment perhaps the russians were smiling before or after the picture was taken i think youre looking way too into this
space,not_removed,and they help get rid of all the trolls
space,not_removed,baikonur is exterritorial russian laws russian everything like an embassy so its kazakhstan in terms of geography russian in terms of laws and control but if you launch a rocket from russian embassy in washington it will be launched from usa therefore saying that rockets launched from baikonur are launched from kazakhstan just makes more sense unless you are dealing with law nuances ours or not ours notion doesnt really apply here
space,not_removed,goat is pretty good we eat it regularly from the mexican deli goat stew goat carnitas
space,not_removed,after reading chris hadfields book its not theyve been floating weightless for months able to move a literal ton with one fingertip being back on earth the gravity is so oppressive and their muscles so week they feel like ninety year olds
space,not_removed,the bomb wasnt developed specifically for japan though
space,not_removed,wwii was pretty weird when you start comparing it to many other conflicts the political military and civilian world became very blurred by the end of the war i think it was churchill who suggested firebombing civilian centers in the hope that destruction would force the civilians to topple their own governments to end the war in all honesty everyone focuses on the atomic bombs but the doctrine was no real different than the firebombings regardless of the merits the point is that the civilians were targeted as they were considered war assets i think dan carlins logical insanity hardcore history podcast gets into the nitty gritty of this topic though
space,not_removed,obviously a sober russian is deceiving someone probably not really russian
space,not_removed,thats why rockets take off from the florida coast instead of a convenient location like nyc the parking costs on the coast there are way cheaper than nyc
space,not_removed,smile he was
space,not_removed,i saw that shit in imax and it was an experience wish i did the same with interstellar
space,not_removed,it does you guys rent it from us it doesnt make it yours the territory of the town and the facilities around it are on the lease to russia but it doesnt make it yours its still ours dont judge my reaction in light of recent events people now make sure that you guys remember whats yours and whats not yours i thought i might have to let you know once again that baikonur belongs to kazakhstan
space,not_removed,right we developed an equal opportunity ultra murder bomb
space,not_removed,its cute you think your opinions matter
space,not_removed,that is exactly the reason the taxi unions fought hard against this decision
space,not_removed,i dont think that was a joke
space,not_removed,maybe russians are just happier in general
space,not_removed,thank lenin im finally away from that smiling american woman
space,not_removed,wtf is wrong with you i just explained the case to the people who didnt even knew baikonur were in kazakhstan i said it is rented by russia from kazakhstan in my first comment for fucks sake do you know what rent means do you know what exterritorial means i dont judge your reaction i judge your reading comprehention
space,not_removed,ok so as long as you and everyone else keeps in mind that baikonur is a kazakh land im happy the term ours certainly applies here because it is indeed ours so just to clarify baikonur is a kazakh land temporarilry given to the russian governments use its just as kazakh as petropavlovsk pavlodar or ustkamenogorsk its not a russian town its a kazakh town
space,not_removed,filthy animals heres an upvote for your submission space concept art is always wonderful
space,not_removed,my father worked at nasa for the mercury and apollo missions he had this picture along with a few others hanging in his room this one always stood out to me and i remember it so vividly it showed scale better than the rest of the photos and left an indelible imprint in my memory
space,not_removed,ok that actually gave me a giggle of course its for consumption on mars not transport back no offence if that was a legitimate question
space,not_removed,ahah yeh me to turn mars in a vegetable planet
space,not_removed,i was just reading about the sun a couple days ago coronal mass ejections specifically apparently they weigh billions of tons and are hurled into space with speeds ranging from to miles per second absolutely mindboggling in the largest coronal mass ejection ever recorded occurred it shot out into space at a speed of roughly million kilometers per hour our sun is out of this world source
space,not_removed,according to this article its the second stage from chinas long march rocket
space,not_removed,the mormons have finally received an early warning of the second coming
space,not_removed,much better quality than my video i was at work on the ramp of slc airport so i had a lot of light around and the phone didnt capture how brilliant the flame trails were
space,not_removed,you could see it in colorado too pretty impressive if not a little creepy at the time
space,not_removed,ive seen space debris before then it was during dusk so it was lit by red sky very cool looking
space,not_removed,the zooming in and out and its respective perspective doesnt settle well with my stomach and made me queasy but nevertheless excellent footage this is a really great shot
space,not_removed,i was working the early shift at the philadelphia airport around when we saw a very similar display in the sky it looked like it was going to rain fire in downtown philly later found out it was an old russian rocket and was actually several hundred miles out over the ocean
space,not_removed,finally one i could of seen and i was going to take a time lapse last night too man this bums be out
space,not_removed,that ranks among the largest objects to come back to earth unguided over the last few years small debris rains down on earth every day vaporizing from the scorching temperatures of reentry but the reentry of chunks space junk as large as the long march second stage are less common what happens to all the other second stages of leo missions
space,not_removed,i love the unadulterated shriek of terror at the beginning
space,not_removed,a reply i found on stackexchange specific to spacex but its neat
space,not_removed,this is posted on this sub several times a day and has been for several days and nobody knows why
space,not_removed,nasa released a
space,not_removed,there is no link visible either edit your post and add a link or delete and repost
space,not_removed,wow i bet he was really freaking out when that happened a hole in his suit would be catastrophic moms ironon patches wouldnt be good enough
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,pretty neat the space tourism thing is taking off not sure why though but when i first saw this my gut reaction was it was going to end badly for the crew hope that isnt the case because we need people to be excited about space and keep the ball rolling
space,not_removed,yup the combination of speed of light delays minutes round trip impossibility of repair and heft of equipment carried means we have to be incredibly ginger with all of the rovers out there every little move is preplanned and researched beforehand its one of the big reasons why a human expedition is so appealing being able to look at something interesting meters away walk out to it pick up a sample and take it back to the heavy lab equipment all in a single day would speed things up tremendously even sitting in orbit piloting the robots live would be a huge help
space,not_removed,i appreciate the fact that you really did look this up out of curiosity
space,not_removed,its like walking with a toddler daddy look at this rock and this one and this one im gonna climb that dirt pile you think there are bugs under it ill check daddy daddy daddy iphone locked communications reestablished what is it look at this rock sigh well never make our dinner reservation on time
space,not_removed,it noticed it was on its way to harlem and turned around curiosity is a racist robot
space,not_removed,so one manhattan in england we measure things in double decker buses olympic sized swimming pools wembely stadiums and wales
space,not_removed,the area covered by neil and buzz during apollo was about the size of a football field
space,not_removed,sort of puts into perspective how much we still dont know about the planet really imagine this little path was layered over the atacama desert we would think there was no water or life on earth either edit for everyone who seems to think im an idiot yes i understand it is not a fair comparison and that the rovers were landed in places specifically that we had information about from probes and satellites yes earth and mars are not fairly comparative we can see everything is a desert but what would landing in the atacama tell us about the sahara or the gobi or the great sandy desert theyre all deserts they look similar from space yet they are so different hell even antartica is technically a desert my point is that while there is quite a lot we do know until we get down and actually explore and dig and do actual study of the physical surface of mars with people or thousands of rovers we dont know even about the history of the planet aside from what we think we know based on measurements and inference of those results about an alien world im not suggesting a massive alien city or tropical rainforest is just over the next mountain range thats stupid we know europa is waterice do we really think its just like the ice from back home just because we know what ice is here of course not finally we do have a narrow band of places to look for things based on life as we know it imagine what we will find as we explore the rest of the planet
space,not_removed,the principal investigator for spirit and opportunity steve squyres you know im a robot guy thats what i have spent most of my career doing but im actually a very strong supporter of human spaceflight i believe that the most successful exploration is going to be carried out by humans not by robots what spirit and opportunity have done in years on mars you and i could have done in a good week rovers are cool but theyre excruciatingly slow
space,not_removed,imagine how little you would learn about the diversity of earths environments if you only explored manhattan and people still ask isnt or rovers enough
space,not_removed,well i mean the goal isnt to spin cookies and fly dirt rooster tails they are literally looking at every rock and outcrop along the way
space,not_removed,are we just going to ignore he said out of curiosity which happens to be the name of the mars rover
space,not_removed,jesus ive lived here for years and i dont even go north of the park
space,not_removed,thats shorter than my commute to work if you take the ac train its under a half hour someone please give that poor rover a metrocard swipe
space,not_removed,who would have thought that the first planet in our solar system to be overrun by robot invaders from outer space would be mars
space,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters used in this commentextravehicular activity used in this commentintercontinental ballistic missile used in this commentjet propulsion lab california used in this commenttrojan httpsenwikipediaorgwikilagrangianpoint of a twobody system degrees ahead of the smaller body used in this commenttrojan httpsenwikipediaorgwikilagrangianpoint of a twobody system degrees behind the smaller body used in this commentlaunch escape system used in this commentmars colonial transporter used in this commentmars science laboratory curiosity used in this commentradioisotope thermoelectric generator used in this commentspace launch system heavylift used in this commentsingle stage to orbit im a bot and i first saw this thread at jun utc httpwwwdecronymxyz httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
space,not_removed,if it was piloted by matt damon it wouldve gotten across the country in less time
space,not_removed,i was wondering if the distance would be of any significant difference if you take into account elevation the rover did travel on some hills no
space,not_removed,wait until you look up the odometer from the future explorations of uranus
space,not_removed,so the rover has covered more square mileage than there is in the division
space,not_removed,we have two active rovers on mars so it might be an idea to specify which one youre talking about
space,not_removed,imagine trying to understand the planet earth by gathering all of your research data in manhattan
space,not_removed,why did it turn around when it realized it was heading towards harlem
space,not_removed,i think its understandable given that one little mistake like getting stuck in loose dirt would end its functionality
space,not_removed,it just worked off one can of cokeand if mars rover can do it so can you
space,not_removed,interesting and all but im not from new york not even america how many bananas is that
space,not_removed,imagine going to such a small area on earth and then extrapolating what the rest of the earth is like from so little info
space,not_removed,why didnt the rover just take the train thats a minute subway ride
space,not_removed,great speed does not equate to great progress ask any good drummer
space,not_removed,sorry for those of you that arent american or easterners curiosity has driven miles km as of sol about years heres a link to where i got the information and more detailed charts such as topography of the journey httpmarsjplnasagovmslmissionwhereistherovernow
space,not_removed,out of curiosity haha very funny because one of the mars rovers is named curiosity
space,not_removed,unfortunately as a west coaster this graphic means basically nothing to me i really have no idea how big the island of manhattan is i get the sense that its like a couple of hours of walking big
space,not_removed,sooo most of our data from that rover comes from a sample area a few miles long
space,not_removed,so how long would it take for it to rove around mars one full lap with that speed a thousand years
space,not_removed,it would be cool to see a diagram like this but representing mark watneys journey across mars in the martian
space,not_removed,would you look at that the rover traveled from one mcdonalds to the other
space,not_removed,cant be too sure but it looks like the mcdonalds on and is an op favorite class choice
space,not_removed,seriously questioning if any of the people with the top comments in this thread have ever even been to manhattan
space,not_removed,i understand its a remarkable achievement but man that thing really wasnt designed for distance
space,not_removed,i could have gotten an uber and traveled that distance cheaper nasa take note if you want to explore mars send an uber
space,not_removed,what is surprising to you the large distance covered by an rc car the small distance covered
space,not_removed,hmmm yup thats about how many years it takes to get through manhattan
space,not_removed,hehe you looked it up out of curiosity get it like the rover ill show my way out
space,not_removed,mars rover is no exception most tourists move about this speed which is why i feel like punching them in the back of the head on a regular basis
space,not_removed,this title confused the hell out of me because you said out of curiosity
space,not_removed,well its not there sight seeing doesnt need to travel very far to achieve its goal
space,not_removed,gotta admit that mars is not flat in any way so it takes ages to move even like five feet
space,not_removed,considering the low speed time delays photography sample testing and obstacles this doesnt surprise me much but it does show a need for something with a lot more umpf
space,not_removed,its going to take centuries for that poor little rover to explore mars
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,so we just need elon musk to build an offroad tesla and put it on a spacex rocket problem solved
space,not_removed,can we get a twitch plays mars rover would probably end up the same
space,not_removed,it went through times square with a camera well nasa is bankrupt joking aside that is actually further than i thought it would have gone i know they made several long drives but i thought the path was more erratic
space,not_removed,all the joking aside this is interesting in how little of the surface of mars has been explored and just shows how slow the rover actually is cant go to fast otherwise it could flip over and nobody would be there to flip it upright even with some sort of self righting mechanism it would still run the risk of damaging sensitive sensors and equipment
space,not_removed,imagine if aliens were getting their only opinions of us from a fouryear walk through the nyc central park
space,not_removed,i know its a little out of date but these are the distance records for rovers
space,not_removed,so journey began at penn station did rover commute in from long island
space,not_removed,theres a whole episode of big bang theory dedicated to making a joke of this
space,not_removed,so well say from madison square garden all the way up to the seinfeld diner shouldve taken the train
space,not_removed,pretty sure thats the precise journey the mouse takes in stuart little
space,not_removed,this is why google maps isnt accurate with directions it really does take years to travel this distance in manhattan
space,not_removed,damn why so slow can we drop a turbo or supercharger into the next rover
space,not_removed,for those of us not living in new york this doesnt really give us much information a legend in the corner would be helpful
space,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment constellatio ndefunctsls manned mission to mars sls you might enjoy this its a defunct program now but when we finally get a funded piloted mars mission it will likely be similar to this i thought was a french pop band from years ago i recommend symphony of science the case for mars for those who want to be excited about exploring mars without the hassle of learning all that science stuff mountain dew or crab juice in the ghetto im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
space,not_removed,question how long was the machine originally projected to operate and now how much longer do they think it will go thanks
space,not_removed,its more impressive when you remember that the distance between earth and mars is a little longer than manhattan
space,not_removed,he should really take a look at the highline this time of year ive heard its spectacular
space,not_removed,think of how much wed have learned going through an alien city that far
space,not_removed,i didnt realize they allowed alcohol on space missions theres no way you stumble around that path without being on something
space,not_removed,very cool image hadnt thought to do that the reason as so many people are pointing out is simple have you ever done anything that required delicate work or youd ruin something precious or valuable you know how your hands might tremble or you might break a sweat while doing something indoors thats basically what any action with the rover is like for the people controlling it any wrong move and its potentially their fault for ending the mission and their job add that to the equipment speeds and latency in communication and this simply makes sense not only that but we know so little about mars that every few feet there are a ton of things to look at and test id be interested in learning how much material the rover has processed
space,not_removed,i cant image spending that much time in manhattan and never going to the lower east side
space,not_removed,the central park muggings really slowed him down
space,not_removed,i wouldnt get much further driving from the lincoln tunnel to the ues in four years either at least curiosity didnt have to pay congestion pricing for the luxury
space,not_removed,should have just gotten an uber
space,not_removed,should get some slelf driving thingamagigs
space,not_removed,should have used a citibike too bad they dont have stations that far north of central park
space,not_removed,oh man because traffic is so bad p
space,not_removed,a human expedition also means a considerable amount of carefully selected martian samples can be brought back to earth via return trips to be analyzed by all kinds of advanced instruments we have here
space,not_removed,or we could just invent httpsenwikipediaorgwikiansible
space,not_removed,when mars is on the other side of the sun which im assuming is when its minutes for a command does the radio signal just go straight to mars it seems like theres a lot of interference on the way ie the sun
space,not_removed,also we have to be fair to nasa here and remember that curiosity is primarily a laboratory on wheels and needs to stay put to do that sciencey stuff it was sent to do many of the investigators on the mission are not happy when they are roving because no chemical science is getting done this is by contrast to the older rovers spirit and opportunity which were more designed to actually rove around and have done a lot more of it than their original day mission called for making curiositys slow progress stand out even more of course curiosity is still a rover and is meant to move but the wheels are more there to get the laboratory up to the higher slopes of mount sharp to do science a spot where we couldnt have safely touched down a science package that didnt have wheels they could actually have put a lot more distance on the odometer if they booked it up the mountain as soon as they landed but they want to get some science done along the way to make sure that the whole mission isnt wasted if they have a failure so they are taking their time
space,not_removed,we have to be incredibly ginger it helps that we are on the red planet
space,not_removed,sitting in orbit piloting the robots live i wonder if astronauts on the iss could control robots on earth to test out the viability of this idea
space,not_removed,with current selfdriving car research doing so well the next trip should be able to take a car that figures things out for itself someone on earth will point to a spot and then wait for it to get there and announce its arrival or to stop somewhere along the way and ask for instructions if you saw something interesting meters away you would just point to it and wait for the car to get there slowly and safely but independently set up some really hard driving tests in the desert and let car manufacturers compete for the right to send their robot cars to mars better to load a rocket up with a herd of five or ten exploratory cars like that on a oneway trip to mars than to send people and all the supplies people would need for a trip there and back plus the manually driven cars they would need to do any exploring even if you wanted to send samples back home it would be much cheaper to have one or more of the cars load samples into a rocket and send the rocket and samples back on a long slow trip home than to send a larger rocket and samples and people and all of their air food and water back home as quickly as possible
space,not_removed,i mention this every time someone says theres no reason to send humans to mars as good as robotic surveyors have become it would take some pretty crazy good autonomous ai to match the sort of freedom of exploration that an actual human onplanet would have
space,not_removed,im afraid youre mistaken msl can drive autonomously without explicit guidance
space,not_removed,i had the opportunity to talk to a geology director for curiosity sorry dont remember his name a few years back i asked him to estimate the duration a manned mission would need to get the same information we are getting from all the rovers he said a few days a week at the most i wish i could remember more context to this but his off the cuff exasperated answer has stuck with me
space,not_removed,wouldnt autonomous navigation obviate the speed of light delay for motion
space,not_removed,and yet they still managed to draw a dick
space,not_removed,bloody humans coming over here stealing our robots jobs
space,not_removed,plus we could annihilate those weird cave dwelling starfish creatures we found there in person
space,not_removed,isnt the general consensus that we should leave interplanetary and interstellar exploration to our robots with the weighted argument that human biology sucks for space stuff
space,not_removed,now there has to be one made out of opportunity
space,not_removed,i would do one but my
space,not_removed,its funny how the mods will allow the jokes that they like and delete the ones they dont like because theyre low effort funny not funny
space,not_removed,thank you ukilopeter all we needed was a pathfinder
space,not_removed,the spirit felt right at the time
space,not_removed,twittercomsarcasticrover
space,not_removed,when do we get to go back home daddy
space,not_removed,or people claiming nasa is a waste of money it only went miles in years my grandma can walk faster than that
space,not_removed,no it just realized that the recent gentrification meant the samples from there wouldnt look too different from the area it had already covered
space,not_removed,and a vigilante hater noping out of hells kitchen whats wrong with blind lawyers and some testosteronefilled emos with guns
space,not_removed,some would say that it was only a sense of self preservation
space,not_removed,its just on its way to hollywood jackson then mississippi
space,not_removed,it just didnt want to embarrass itself as white robots cant jump
space,not_removed,ahem dont you mean morning side heights
space,not_removed,i read this in the voice of the cinemasins guy
space,not_removed,i also measure things in whales
space,not_removed,we usually measure things in freedoms
space,not_removed,more accurately half of one manhattan source i live in new york
space,not_removed,and some more interesting comparisons httpmarsnasagovmslmissionwhereistherovernow httpsenwikipediaorgwikilunarrovingvehicleusage
space,not_removed,what is the size of a football field
space,not_removed,yeah but what about when we put that sweet ass golf cart up there
space,not_removed,theyre people with feet not wheels
space,not_removed,heres the apollo moonwalks other than one walk by armstrong it was all contained on only one half of the field and here it is other than the one armstrong stroll they never left the infield
space,not_removed,that is one of the things i find most annoying about scifi films you have things like ice planet jungle planet sandy planet etc why the fuck do they only have one biome per planet earth has shitloads of them
space,not_removed,you underestimate how versatile life on earth is there are animals in the atacama desert that survive on the dew that collects on cacti
space,not_removed,this isnt the only information we have on mars we selected that area in part because with full maps of the planet and information provided by previous unmanned probes this was a good place to look for hidden things of interest so if we were limited to similar information about earth you could never miss water or life even if you landed in the atacama
space,not_removed,well need bigger wheels and a more powerful engine if were going to tackle olympus mons oh and well need racing stripes and a flagplanting arm with flag for when we get to the top
space,not_removed,red rover red rover send frostyspoons over
space,not_removed,youre missing out the food in harlem spanish harlem is very different than the rest of the city its so gentrified its basically the new les take the up youll be surprised
space,not_removed,you could send a probe see what is up there
space,not_removed,good please dont start rent is high enough as it is
space,not_removed,theres no way that nasas budget can cover a monthly metrocard
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,isnt called a greek and not a trojan
space,not_removed,on the two remaining wheels no less
space,not_removed,fueled by potatoes and wheels patched with duct tape
space,not_removed,someone needs to draw a dick route on manhattan for this
space,not_removed,well i did say i looked it up out of curiosity
space,not_removed,theres two of them naww do they ever meet why do i find this cute
space,not_removed,log pizza is good kalkalash is not clam juice is passable found abundance of indigenous life form but attempts to communicate were unsuccessful life form kept running away and disappearing into holes in the ground flora strangely absent except in square area in the middle of the island
space,not_removed,good god could you imagine some extraterrestrial species using manhatten as their test sample of the human race hey im wockin heyuh ya muthafuckin pussy tell yah mom i send mah regahds
space,not_removed,distance between the start and end point is as the crow flies or for more general manhattan comparisons central park is long and wide
space,not_removed,it drove around in the equivalent of a city park wheres your rover
space,not_removed,also for rough approximations yards and meters are near the same length
space,not_removed,bananas roughly miles inch bananas edit im told it traveled miles inch bananas bananas
space,not_removed,i think thats algonquin in gta so like minute to drive there
space,not_removed,as a person who had never been to nyc before i had the bright idea of trying to walk from the southernmost point on manhattan to central park on my day trip as a way of seeing the city after walking over hours and sightseeing along the way i realized that i hadnt even covered a quarter of the distance to compare i visited the city of cleveland once and tried the same thing i made if from one side to the other in under minutes on my nyc trip i realized quickly that if i was going to see anything that day i was going to have to learn to use the subway
space,not_removed,central park is miles long so at a glance it looks like miles from start to finish
space,not_removed,central park is about shorter than golden gate park their widths are about the same
space,not_removed,i think its just showing how small the area of mars weve explored is
space,not_removed,unfortunately as a non american this is nonsense to me aswell show us where you found the overlay so we can put it somewhere local
space,not_removed,having been to ny a couple of times id say this is minutes to an hour of nycstyle walking longer if you want to take your time and see the sights central park is pretty long curiosity should have just taken the subway
space,not_removed,in la distance its roughly the from ucla to the airport also takes about just as long as curiosity would
space,not_removed,id say all of the data from that rover comes from the sample area where else could it get data from
space,not_removed,no no no you wait here for security to take you out
space,not_removed,if you think about it it kinda is sigh seeing
space,not_removed,it has a nuclear rtg for power generation so it doesnt need to worry about recharging but it does stop frequently to take samples pictures and give the researchers time to plan the next movements its capable of moving per hour but its average is closer to per hour it takes between and minutes for its signals to reach earth and another to minutes for our signals to reach it so looking at its navigation images and telling it what to do next takes a long time
space,not_removed,the falcon can put a tesla on a transfer trajectory to mars
space,not_removed,theyd think all the natives ran everywhere in a world filled with trees
space,not_removed,the main mission was two months or something like that but the rover was obviously designed to be able to go on for at least a decade but everything after the main mission is considered a bonus because you never know what happens and you should plan your mission so that you have a high chance of declaring the mission a success
space,not_removed,that explains the busted wheel
space,not_removed,actually central park is a very safe park it was probably all the tourists asking him for directions or to take their picture that slowed him down
space,not_removed,did the rover make this trip in
space,not_removed,the central park muggings really slowed him down so youre not from nyc got it
space,not_removed,his curiosity kept him going though even as the spirit of his deceased twin faded half a world away
space,not_removed,at least he didnt end up like hitchhiker bot
space,not_removed,he doesnt have the app though
space,not_removed,how could we afford all those slelfs
space,not_removed,return trips are the hard part
space,not_removed,man youre telling me the govt is in favor of bringing back martian samples but i can bring a french apple into the country thats some bull ish right there
space,not_removed,then days later most of us are dead
space,not_removed,level up enough in science to mount the higgs boson and youll be closer to that invention
space,not_removed,i heard that we are trying but quantum entanglement is hard
space,not_removed,when mars is behind the sun no signals can be sent or received its called a mars solar conjunction and happens once every years and lasts for about weeks last time was in june
space,not_removed,and that robots dont have souls
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,it absolutely would but it would be very difficult to get robots to the point where its not important to send humans too better smarter robots start running into some of the same issues that a human mission would without bringing all of the benefits the radiation environment out there is in many ways harder on our technology than it is on us the transistors in state of the art processors are so small that individual hits from some space radiation particles can permanently damage them as a result things like that dont tend to last for the months and years that wed prefer an expensive proberover to smarter machines would need much more radiation shielding or more of the weaker radhardened chips rovers use now need more power and be more expensive going purely robotic will still probably be cheaper but you dont get the scientific benefits of putting humans in new environments the engineering benefits of being forced to learn how to keep humans alive away from the earth for long periods of time and the public interest benefits of having a person go where no one has ever gone before those expensive robotic missions are easier to justify to congress if they lead to the us getting an impressive new feather in their cap
space,not_removed,well we didnt stop building trains after the first train crash
space,not_removed,if you saw something interesting meters away you would just point to it and wait for the car to get there slowly and safely but independently actually curiosity and to a lesser extent spiritopportunity could can already do that curiosity has a set of stereo cameras that allow it to build a map of the terrain and then it can autonomously drive to a given location even picking out targets itself to investigate literature
space,not_removed,sorry too late msl has autonomous navigation capability
space,not_removed,the
space,not_removed,robots are cheaper and relatively expendable but humans are more flexible and give greater science returns since you get to study human biology in a new environment at the very very least im of the opinion that both are weaker without the other its also not often talked about but human exploration is more inspiring people look up to astronauts want to be them etc having a human component drives interest in the space program and quite likely increases the funding available for the robotic side too
space,not_removed,relevant
space,not_removed,he did take the opportunity to make this post didnt he
space,not_removed,i thought it was a great discovery when some enterprise from columbia launched a challenger robot from atlantis which is in itself an endeavour to find
space,not_removed,yeah but can she walk faster on mars
space,not_removed,maybe we should send her and some humans then
space,not_removed,not after im done with her ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
space,not_removed,did barry fake the mars rover
space,not_removed,you saying all brothers are the same
space,not_removed,i think if you ever visit hk you would be disappointed with number of crime fighting vigilante blind lawyers plenty of testosterone filled guys though
space,not_removed,i work in harlem can confirm
space,not_removed,its actually jackson mississippi i believe not two separate places
space,not_removed,the only thing i measure in whales is your mom
space,not_removed,might i suggest measuring in wales instead
space,not_removed,i measure things in blue whales dicks thats to and a half meters
space,not_removed,rather than getting into fractions it is way easier to explain as one boyhattan
space,not_removed,lets not forget our little buddy opportunity i think its actually now
space,not_removed,that had to be a little terrifying to be almost miles away from the lander its far enough away that you cant even see it and if you get lost youre super fucked
space,not_removed,wow almost miles is a heck of a long way from safety id freak out i i got more than a hours walking distance
space,not_removed,to be fair our solar system does have planets with just one biome wait is degrees in the morning and at night all the time a biome
space,not_removed,kinda funny i wrote a book about a man that wakes up on a desert planet yeah real original i know and immediately went wait that makes no sense no way the entire planet is desert so yeah some scifi writers take it into consideration just not good ones
space,not_removed,im not sure if everyone is being deliberately obtuse or just being argumentative
space,not_removed,yes but my point is that this small sliver of study that we have still potentially doesnt tell us very much im not suggesting there is some vast civilisation living underground but it shows just how much there is still to learn you wouldnt infer the existence of manhattan and space travel based on finding some small animals subsisting on dew if you happened to find any at all in the tiny small part of the planet you surveyed
space,not_removed,and paint it red red unz go fasta
space,not_removed,im not sure if youre joking or not but i would pay an extra penny on every dollar i spent from now on if our rovers had racing stripes on them
space,not_removed,ha i get it because mars rovers
space,not_removed,stab em stab em hurry hes got rusty spoons
space,not_removed,i know man im embarrassed by it maybe this weekend
space,not_removed,decronym bot says les is launch escape system is this true haha
space,not_removed,its really not that gentrified harlem is still only white and eastspanish harlem is only white gentrification is certainly underway but its still a hugely minoritydominated neighborhood to say its so gentrified isnt really accurate
space,not_removed,take the up if i wanted to park under the bridge the rest of my life i woulda became a homeless man kidding is the only way up
space,not_removed,no not exactly a trojan is an asteroid minor planet or moon that shares the orbit of a planet or larger moon jupiter has two main clusters of trojans divided into camps the trojan camp clustered around and the greek camp clustered around so greeks are the trojans of jupiter
space,not_removed,two active rovers and two no longer active rovers no two rovers have ever met on the surface of mars the second active rover oppurtunity has an inactive twin on the planet spirit the twin rovers were designed for a day mission sols but opportunity is still active after days on the surface truly remarkable the first rover was the sojourner back in the ninties and it was active for about weeks a sol is a martian day
space,not_removed,except for large square earth is pretty much uninhabitable next planet
space,not_removed,could you imagine someone using an movie caricature of new yorkers as their test sample of manhattanites
space,not_removed,minute to drive there cruising leroy jenkins or star chase type driving
space,not_removed,i had the bright idea of trying to walk from the southernmost point on manhattan to central park dear god man thats up hill too
space,not_removed,central park is actually a bit more than miles long blocks is a mile in manhattan central park goes from blocks if you map it on google itll tell you miles as well
space,not_removed,i mean to say that overlaying it on manhattan doesnt help at all beyond guessing its something like a few miles the actual number would have been more useful
space,not_removed,if the security here is as slow as the curiousity this could take awhile
space,not_removed,very true depends on the context
space,not_removed,the tricky part will be the landing i guess
space,not_removed,thanks for the info hope it goes a long time the pictures are incredible im sure the science is amazing as well
space,not_removed,and the distinct smell of burnt bum juice and hot mayonnaise
space,not_removed,did he not learn from his cousin in philly you would think he would be more careful
space,not_removed,looks like daredevil and the punisher arent keeping the streets of hell kitchen safe anymore
space,not_removed,and the chinese tourists on the empire state building
space,not_removed,can you imagine the roaming charges to download it and there goes nasas budget to verizon
space,not_removed,we just sell the babbies before the babbies frigth back
space,not_removed,i recommend robert zubrins the case for mars to anyone interested in the logistics
space,not_removed,especially when the person you sent decides to settle down and farm potatoes
space,not_removed,return trips pffss just colonize
space,not_removed,so many lost kerbals agree
space,not_removed,also the initial trip is the hard part and the time spent on the planet and the research and development and planning
space,not_removed,yes and no yeah you got to land a rocket on mars however mars has less than of the atmosphere of earth and about the gravity earths atmosphere is the biggest issue when it comes to leaving the surface compared to mars you might as well be launching a rocket through the ocean buzz aldrin has routine return trips from mars to earth pretty well figured out with his cycler is just a matter if anyone is listening
space,not_removed,what if they made a space ship that are the actual trip between planets and a separate shuttle that went to the planet surface and back to the mothership
space,not_removed,it doesnt sound much harder than like all the other parts
space,not_removed,its not if you do it oldschool explorer style and send a fleet of ships
space,not_removed,maybe if you could refuel there send some tanks ahead or bring equipment to make fuel maybe
space,not_removed,everything about a human mars trip is hard its far away orbital paths mean you have to stay there for years cant remember exact time but its around there etc
space,not_removed,if were sending people qualified to do that work to mars weve already figured out the getting back part
space,not_removed,they could just use that maneuver from that matt damon movie the martian except i think only matt damon could pull that off
space,not_removed,mars is filled with iron just build another ship when you get there
space,not_removed,who needs to return lets think about putting permanent bases there no returntrips for all
space,not_removed,its impossible to instantaneously sent information with quantum entanglement
space,not_removed,it also would likely be slower than the speed of light
space,not_removed,could we get around that by well placed satellites in the future
space,not_removed,awesome figured something like this happened at some point but ive never read about it thanks for the link
space,not_removed,yup apparently all went well but before we do this on mars we have to make sure we have the airbus engineers on the surface to sort out the issues when the astronauts in the station hit a rock with the rover
space,not_removed,he had to get into the spirit of things
space,not_removed,yeah shell be walking even faster to get away from you
space,not_removed,see what unothatwasusedtoo has to say about this on the no spin zone at
space,not_removed,hes saying all the brothers moved out
space,not_removed,ay captain did ya drop anchor in the blow hole then just make sure to steer clear of the poop deck unless nautical nonsense be something you wish
space,not_removed,it would have gone farther but they stopped it because of the knocking
space,not_removed,ouch doesnt look like anyone else but the us is have much success with mars operations httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofmissionstomars
space,not_removed,the avocado
space,not_removed,you can follow your track back since they wont blow away
space,not_removed,its like a minute skip back to base
space,not_removed,right that must have been a weird feeling out there
space,not_removed,yards is basically similar to a meter so i sorta understand thanks
space,not_removed,hell biome it freezes over at night
space,not_removed,i guess if dead is a biome than yeah
space,not_removed,a desert planet wouldnt be a planet with just desert that would be ridiculous now a planet with desert from equator to halfway then arid think afghanistan and some savannah until the poles maybe even temperate mediterranean style shrubs and sparse forest in places where mountains force precipitation i imagine it would be a pangea style continent in a planet with ocean cover sorta like a gigantic australia
space,not_removed,but dont forget we did a lot of satellite photographing radar scanning altitude scanning we know the martian surface pretty well the things what we dont know is everything under the sand
space,not_removed,i think i know what you are getting at but im pretty sure the mass of satellites surveying mars would have found something huge like a manhattan or an immensely different biome
space,not_removed,wait so opportunity was designed to be functional for days but its been days and it still is holy shit
space,not_removed,if they meet they will breed and then their offspring will return to take over there is a reason why we dont let them meet
space,not_removed,did i not
space,not_removed,what manhattan doesnt have any real hills until you go north of central park you wouldnt encounter any noticeable hills on that walk
space,not_removed,correction of earlier post httpsenwikipediaorgwikicuriosityrover primary mission was intended for two years finished after years its currently on year assuming no accidents the radio isotopic generator will continue to produce sufficient power for a total of years more years since curiosity doesnt have any solar panels it will stop around this time it might be able to go on for another years in a stationary position bu this is just my speculations httpsenwikipediaorgwikiopportunityrover primary mission was intended for days months its currently on month years since opportunity is powered by solar panels as long as they are not to thickly covered by dust or any other accident or wear brings it to a halt opportunity will go on indefinitely
space,not_removed,and the pizza really kept him busy
space,not_removed,manhattan the final frontier these are the voyages of the star rover on mars its continuing mission to explore strange new shops to seek out new pizzas and new restaurants to boldly go where no one has gone before
space,not_removed,in england bum means ass thank the stars you put it in manhattan and not london
space,not_removed,mountain dew or crab juice
space,not_removed,maybe he should move in with his auntie and uncle in belair
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,god im so sick of them perched on the empire state waving blonde women around and swatting down biplanes fuckin chinese tourists man
space,not_removed,seriously in case real chinese people or tourists see this i used to work in midtown and i loved seeing tourists i was a little weirdly proud to be working in a place that tourists wanted to visit i think new yorkers griping about tourists is mostly a form of humble bragging on topic i think the real issue here is how deep our probes have gone rather than how far on the surface it seems as if if were interested in the life on mars story we need a core that goes down as far as possible
space,not_removed,obviously they need to do way instain mother first
space,not_removed,my dad actually helped design a theoretical mars base back in the for some aerospace company he had all the old stuff in boxes and i looked through it once it was super cool
space,not_removed,i recommend symphony of science the case for mars for those who want to be excited about exploring mars without the hassle of learning all that science stuff
space,not_removed,freaking zubrinhe invented on paper the most powerful stardrive in a game i play when folks asked for a rebalance the game designer talked to zubrin and he replied yep its just that good
space,not_removed,there are no failed returns only new colonies
space,not_removed,sir remember that crew of entirely male astronauts that was stranded on mars they theyre breeding sir life uh finds a way
space,not_removed,i volunteer im done with this planet i want a new one
space,not_removed,even with a aldrin cycler you still need a rocket capable of reaching mars in order to rendezvous with the cycler on the way there and a rocket capable of returning to earth in order to rendezvous with the cycler on the way back
space,not_removed,earths atmosphere is the biggest issue when it comes to leaving the surface that doesnt sound right the atmosphere is only a problem if youre moving very fast arent the rockets already way past the densest part before they even get up to speed id say the biggest issue is simply earths gravity
space,not_removed,thats how we landed on the moon
space,not_removed,you might enjoy this its a defunct program now but when we finally get a funded piloted mars mission it will likely be similar to this
space,not_removed,it makes sense to do this for the earth side of the trip but ships like spacexs mct intend to land the entire thing on mars because the lower gravity and thin atmosphere make it much simpler to do a single stage to orbit launch
space,not_removed,mars httpnssdcgsfcnasagovplanetaryfactsheetmarsfacthtml it would still be a pain in the ass getting off the ground there
space,not_removed,god dammit fallout you ruin everything
space,not_removed,yes sticking a communications satellite at the httpsenwikipediaorgwikilagrangianpoint would solve the issue we dont have anything there yet but the communications blackout is already a bit of an issue so its probably going to happen as we continue putting more assets robotic or human on and around mars nasa is also developing a laser communications system to allow for high throughput on such a satellite
space,not_removed,yeah maybe once were doing a lot more stuff on other planets communication satellites in a solar orbit to bounce signals around the sun would make sense right now its not too much of a hassle to just put things on hold for a couple of weeks every few years
space,not_removed,just sojourner we have run out of puns im so sorry
space,not_removed,rovers next stop camden nj
space,not_removed,because opportunity only knocks once
space,not_removed,generic scifi horror erased tracks
space,not_removed,so i do have a shot with her
space,not_removed,pretty close to mine mine has four smaller inland seas pretty much making it percent land but definitely desert then scrubland then huge sweeping savannahs with forests at the poles
space,not_removed,yes it is really incredible nasa expected dust and sand that collect on the solar arrays to block the sun too much but what they didnt know was that there are stronger and more winds on mars than they thought the solar arrays get undusted by the gusts of wind
space,not_removed,its a little misleading nothing was designed to last exactly days and then die days was the primary mission time in other words to justify the expense of the mission they had to do x y and z within days so everything was built with the idea of doing x y and z within days an extended mission was always expected barring any major failures most components were designed and constructed expecting to be around for months the biggest issue were the solar panels which were expected to eventually become too dusty to generate enough power for the mission to continue after a year or so but unexpected periodic cleaning events due to martian winds enabled the rovers to continue longer than anticipated
space,not_removed,thanks for the details long live the rovers
space,not_removed,dont forget the halal cart food with white sauce of course
space,not_removed,all these references i dont get
space,not_removed,in england bum means ass it means that in america too except its somewhat euphemistic like how parents speak to small children
space,not_removed,just what the fuck is burnt donkey juice
space,not_removed,smell of burnt tramp juice also unpleasant in american english
space,not_removed,but then if he said tramp it would confuse americans though it would still work
space,not_removed,depends if its pride month then the bumjuice flows richly
space,not_removed,king kong hong kong whats the difference
space,not_removed,that reminds me of an article i read a few years ago in some trashy racist tabloid about a fight in the empire state building they were hosting a charity event on the floor for sick children or something and raising money by having people show off their talents while dressed in unusual costumes well apparently a fight broke out over which order a couple of people were going to do their routines which was obviously not appropriate for a charity event and eventually the cops were called to break it up one of the guys was an asian man dressed in a gorilla suit his routine was going to be singing country songs and the other i think was a brit who was there to play table tennis while also coincidentally dressed as a gorilla there was some confusion about which of them was to go first because of their outfits and they started fighting over the table i think they both got warnings from the police and took their turns later on in the day the only reason i remember this particular story is because the headline was ching chong king kong singsong ping pong dingdong
space,not_removed,i think youre thinking of king kongor kristap porzingis
space,not_removed,dont start ive been under the wether this mroing
space,not_removed,jesus so tragic my pary are with the father who lost his chrilden i am truley sorry for your lots
space,not_removed,post it here for infinite karma
space,not_removed,please share dude front page stuff
space,not_removed,that sounds really interesting any chance youd share it
space,not_removed,did the name wong appear in any of the research papers
space,not_removed,that sounds super proprietary though
space,not_removed,i see some kerbal experience here
space,not_removed,rescue missions pff you mean additional colonists
space,not_removed,yeah i bet you are the guy we are looking for if you cant handle life on earth mars is probably easier for you
space,not_removed,even if it means no more pumpkin spice lattés
space,not_removed,gravity is definitely the bigger issue but the atmosphere really doesnt help rockets dont get up to speed until theyre out of the thick parts of the atmosphere because theyre trying to avoid wasting fuel to air drag they also take a less efficient path to get out of it as quickly as possible
space,not_removed,air resistance is should be lower on mars i would think would take much less energy to speed up on mars acceleration would be much higher
space,not_removed,ssto would actually be a reason for a dedicated surface to orbit shuttle due to the reusability of such shuttle if we could do a reusable ssto on earth we would already have spaceship factories in space
space,not_removed,thats an awesome deal in my opinion i get lamb over rice sometimes and they fuckin load that shit up i see him put the rice in and im like ok thats a normal amount of rice then he starts adding the lamb scoop one that looks good scoop two thats a good amount of meat scoop holy shit how is he going to close the container scoop four ok seriously how does he not run out of meat in like minutes scoop five ok i guess i dont need to get dinner later or breakfast tomorrow then he just blankets the whole thing with white sauce its a huge fucking meal for and its awesome
space,not_removed,you know the sauce is going to be good when its named for its color and not its ingredients
space,not_removed,its inner city life on mars
space,not_removed,all references to beautiful new york city shitty roads stinky homeless the smell of hot garbage muggings and cheap pizza
space,not_removed,guy fieris next restaurant
space,not_removed,tramp juice should be some kind of horrible energy drink
space,not_removed,vagrant vagabond itinerant
space,not_removed,that was the last in the trilogy with chix nix hix pix and nut screws washer and bolts preceding it
space,not_removed,get your dad to do an ama for more karma
space,not_removed,yall know it was really just a badly painted diorama right
space,not_removed,ill look for it his office is messy and huge and i havent seen it in years but im sure its all in there
space,not_removed,you dont look like a wong well my mother was irish and you father wasnt
space,not_removed,tell that to the kerbal trapped in orbit around kerbol slowly pushing his capsule home via eva
space,not_removed,especially because of those damn lattes
space,not_removed,especially if it means no more pumpkin spice lattés
space,not_removed,sounds like our atmosphere is a total drag
space,not_removed,you need heatshielding and parachutes to land on mars efficiently both of those things would be very difficult to replace in orbit and a single cycle of landing and taking off would take a huge toll on all of the components meaning it needs rebuilding and refurbishing weve seen from the space shuttle that reusability isnt as easy as it seems now imagine doing it while orbiting mars with only a handful of people in cumbersome space suits its just not feasible
space,not_removed,for the mct it would be two stage to earth orbit refuel in orbit then one stage to the martian surface after refueling on the surface with fuel fabricated from the martian atmosphere it would be able to go all the way back to earth on a single tankstage assuming it left some cargo behind
space,not_removed,not if the fuel and maintenance costs for said ssto were close to what it costs to just make a disposable rocket in the first place which from what i recall is the real barrier thats kept ssto spacecraft from becoming a reality
space,not_removed,enjoy that for me ive since moved away but had a guy around the corner my office who despite having a line would see me give me a quick whats up nod and have my order ready in about seconds that id then pay for on the side on a side note when i worked down on wall street i used buy weed out of a pizza van from a dude name smiley id hand over a bill and get a slice of sicilian pepperoni and soda along with a gram of some pretty decent weed that city is full of characters and crazy places to discover
space,not_removed,shit any of those places in philly
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,the ¢ pizza is really fucking good though
space,not_removed,where muh constant smell of urine at
space,not_removed,some people stink so bad theyll not only clear out and entire subway car but render it unocupyable until it has been fully disinfected by the mta
space,not_removed,ah the smell of hot muggings in the morning
space,not_removed,you forgot the urine smell but to be honest its actually not that bad boston smells more than the few places i was at in nyc
space,not_removed,its a diner a drivein and a dive
space,not_removed,i think its actually called mad dog
space,not_removed,use it to go to mars for more karma
space,not_removed,picture of your mum for more yknow
space,not_removed,maaaaan just hit em with another rocket or better yet a satellite
space,not_removed,whos forcing you to drink them
space,not_removed,i only drink spiced lattes made with coffee beans and pumpkins grown organically in martian soil so
space,not_removed,why would you do those that bra in orbit and not on the surface the orbit to surface trip is the equipment intensive one the surface to orbit the fuel intensive
space,not_removed,mars atmosphere is so thin that parachutes are less mass efficient than powered descent and they cant really slow the lander enough thus the inflatable bubbles on the curiosity landing pod spacex will land a kg red dragon on mars in and that is as much as curiosity that also did a powered landing
space,not_removed,for a slice and pop thats steep
space,not_removed,youve gotta be careful here bros is whack the places that simply are called fresh pizza are the best where the pizzas are continually coming outta the oven not sitting around and reheated
space,not_removed,for a dollar maybe but theres way better pizza out there
space,not_removed,dude that aint real pizza
space,not_removed,theres always that one car when i moved to queens my sister taught me a valuable lesson if the whole train is packed but you see an empty car theres a good reason why its empty
space,not_removed,ahhhh yes the old why is this car empty at rush hour then you get throat punched with the wall of bo
space,not_removed,yooo thats my drank there needs to be advertising for it do you like waking up in ditches covered in what you can only imagine is your own piss or possibly someone elses do you enjoy dealing with angry fat women you never called back after banging their butthole like a bongo drum mad dog is for you luck stupidity a great time
space,not_removed,that that actually checks out yeah mad dog is one of the few things that manages to be less classy than boones farm
space,not_removed,haaaaaaaaaaaa best comment of my day so far
space,not_removed,post picture of an adorable kitten sniffing a martian rock for more karma than all the previous posts combined
space,not_removed,do an ama from mars for more karma
space,not_removed,post a picture of a safe you found wait two weeks then open it with the plans for a martian base inside for more karma
space,not_removed,i will post the pics of his mum i think i have some more interesting angles
space,not_removed,i can picture his mum when i close my eyes
space,not_removed,implying i have the skill to do that
space,not_removed,youd need some kind of pressurised hangar to put it in for a start plus specialised heavy equipment to lift it up and remove large components on earth they build spacecraft in climate controlled clean rooms with not a speck of dust in sight the surface of mars would be a terrible environment for that kind of work and would make for poorly built spacecraft which would be very dangerous so unless were talking about a full scale colony with machine shops spare parts storerooms and engineering equipment its not going to work
space,not_removed,i guess youre assuming that the gram of weed costs from what he said i know plenty of people that sell grams for so i would assume its closer to for the pepperoni slice and a soda with a gram
space,not_removed,percys on bleecker street is the best slice in the city if you dont agree ill give you your money back
space,not_removed,the fresh pizza are whack too not worth saving a plus ive seen those fuckers drop pizzas on the floor and then serve it up
space,not_removed,the thing is its not simply bo its not piss shit or alcohol sweats either i mean there are notes of these but the body of it is something all its own something i call the stench of the rotten soul it is some kind of pungent pheromone that announces a person as severely damaged and possibly dangerous
space,not_removed,dont forget about st ides
space,not_removed,glad i could help someone my day when to shite almost right after posting that
space,not_removed,take a video of a hydraulic press crushing nevermind
space,not_removed,let the kitten put the rock in a hydraulic press on mars
space,not_removed,this is the closest i could get httpimgurcomapqgmgk
space,not_removed,originally read this as affordable kitten and was really confused why the price would matter
space,not_removed,start rmartiansgw for more karma
space,not_removed,in science we dont speculate then proceeds to discuss dark energy supersymetry string theory all of which are entirely speculative the more i hear about darke energy the more it sounds like aether not sayinng i have a better answer but i find the commentary amusing
space,not_removed,well as he basically says it could just be a property of space as opposed to real energy also unlike aether dark energy isnt really a different theory this λ value in gr we can add without really complicating things although going for the simpler model special relativity people had the edge aether is essentially classical mechanicselectromagnetism but they dont work entirely together which makes that theory less simple on the other hand you should realize that at one point they didnt actually have experimental evidence distinguishing the two
space,not_removed,if you have a rocket yes nothings stopping you so in reality that means almost nobody can go into space unless some government decides that you should go to space
space,not_removed,the russians sold seats to mir before it came down it was something like million if iirc edit it was more like million httpsenwikipediaorgwikispacetourismlistofflownspacetourists
space,not_removed,literally the post before yours is a all space questions thread why did you select against using that thread for this simple question
space,not_removed,considering that ops mom is so fat that well all be in orbit around her soon id say yes
space,not_removed,i hope not because unless you find a new way of ecological space travel this would be horrific for the environment
space,not_removed,well actually the faa might be stopping you
space,not_removed,in short if you have the money you can go to space
space,not_removed,only xkcds randall munroe is allowed to make fat mom gravity jokes on this sub
space,not_removed,i was just wondering trying to get inside the minds of the masses
space,not_removed,as reflected by my very much negative scoring
space,not_removed,well actually its roughly t of kerosene per passenger per flight at least a whole lot worse than airlines
space,not_removed,what i ment was space tourism if that becomes as popular as flying itll be much worse than airplanes
space,not_removed,or hydrogen oxygen aka water
space,not_removed,weve seen planets in nearby star systems that are only a few lights years away to a few dozen light years not millions of light years away
space,not_removed,we can see new solar systems being born right now we are many generations of stars away from reaching the last of the solar systems
space,not_removed,no but we might be alone because we are too soon think about it the universe is billion years old and our planet is billions but the universe will exist for trillions of years we might be one of the first species
space,not_removed,we are inside a black hole living a simulation waiting for it to decays
space,not_removed,i see your point youre saying that its theoretically possible that our nearest star system which is alpha centauri at ly away and all other systems beyond it spontaneously stopped existing within the last years you wouldnt know that until years later thats a very nice philosophical question in general in fact you could even argue that you are the last thing in the universe by that logic but its entirely impossible for solar systems and even galaxies in our vicinity since theres no way they could stop existing spontaneuosly and in such a relatively small timespan
space,not_removed,but still arent we seeing them as they were at some point in the distant past not as they are right now at the end of the day i guess it doesnt matter because we will never be able to contact them in any realistic time frame anyway there could never be a one on one so to speak
space,not_removed,why do i still sub to rspace i really hope youre some kid in elementary school
space,not_removed,never know until you meet someone from another planetary system there could be a civilization with technology which allows them to meet us or communicate with us but which is too far for our technology
space,not_removed,nah were on some glarks smartfrart install of earthville
space,not_removed,yes that is what i am saying theoretically speaking if it could happen then alpha centauri would disappear from our view last since its the closest right i have a hard time wrapping my head around it since i am neither a scientist or a physicist but i am just curious i think it does pose an interesting philosophicaltheoretical notion as wildly impossible as it surely must be theoretically though if the universe did go out of existence we would be alone for at least years would that be right even if our sun collapsed we wouldnt know for minutes you seem to be well versed in this are you a scientist perhaps
space,not_removed,pretty much all the solar systems weve found are within a few hundred light years this means that were seeing them as they were a few hundred years ago not millions the whole thing about the light from stars we see being millions of years old is a myth no visible star is further than a few thousand light years and many solar systems are close enough that the light from them is only a few decades old so no were definitely not the last solar system also theres a reply button under the comments saying username doesnt work here and the distance of something in light years is how long its light has traveled to get us so if we look at something lightyears away were seeing it as it was years ago
space,not_removed,the sub is not meant for professional astronomers although we love hearing from them it is for educated amateur astronomers as well as people who have little or no knowledge of space and are here to simply ask questions your comment is quite condescending and discourages people from asking questions which are perfectly reasonable
space,not_removed,people have to start somewhere man cut people some slack im the only time we talked about anything outside of the earth was when i intentionally took astronomy as an elective in high school it was one of the smallest text books i had and i already knew everything in it from books i bought as a preteen geared toward children i imagine most americans have never had any sort of education on astronomy if you have ever viewed facebook youd be damn sure of this too with all these the moon is going to be purple and the size of a large pizza at arms length this week memes or the ones that show mars appearing in the sky larger than the moon or one showed jupiter in the sky larger than the sun and these things get tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of likes and comments and shares
space,not_removed,im not a professional unfortunately thanks though d theres a lot of information available on the web and elsewhere however for example in the form of youtube serieses such as crash course astronomy or space time cc astronomy is pretty easy to understand especially if you start at the beginning space time is a great deal harder to follow sometimes even if you watch difficult passages like twenty times if all solar systems in the universe except ours suddenly stopped existing all at once alpha centauri would disappear first because it only takes years for the end of the stream of light from it to reach us before that though but after alpha centauri and the others had stopped existing we wouldnt have any way whatsoever of actually knowing it didnt exist so yes wed be alone theoretically but alpha centauri and all the other systems being gone wouldnt change anything for us or in our solar system in the slightest wed still see every single star and there would still be a certain but obviously tiny gravitational pull on our solar system from those stars
space,not_removed,to be fair thats mainly because we cant even identify hints that there might be a planet around a star beyond a few thousand light years i think the most distant planet we believe might exist because of gravitational lensing effects we can observe is away we do know of galaxies at a distance in the order of billions of light years we just cant identify individual systems this far away
space,not_removed,thanks for the clarifications hard to wrap your head around some of this stuff but i do know the earth is definitely not years old as some would have us believe
space,not_removed,whats next is the sun and stars different things there is a certain level of knowledge i expect from someone with access to the internet i make no apologies
space,not_removed,thank you for your patience ive recently retired with extra time on my hands now and being at the limit of my understanding of this you can be sure i will watch those videos
space,not_removed,quite frankly if you believe the earth is younger than years old there isnt very much youre going to be able to wrap your head around if youre going to reject the entirety of modern physics whats the point of even asking this question
space,not_removed,how old is it
space,not_removed,those are apples oranges ask people on a street corner of the sun is a star and id guess know it is ask people if there is evidence of extrasolar planetary bodies and maybe read that article i dont apologize for saying your question is obnoxious but to each his own conclusion you are very very very smart so much smarter than everyone else
space,not_removed,did i say i believe that the notion that the earth is that young is an absurdity of course not i was poking fun at creationists young earthers in particular
space,not_removed,i think hes saying he knows that the earth is more than years old not that he subscribes to the somechristiansidea that it is less than years old
space,not_removed,you managed to word your statement to say the exact opposite
space,not_removed,i find you more confusing than this topic
space,not_removed,this is why people were so excited we finally got to find out what the hell was on the surface afaik the flyby actually did help with scanning for certain elements and densities and all of that but us non scientists were just obsessed with the heart shape
space,not_removed,and new horizons reached pluto seconds earlier than scheduled how cool is that
space,not_removed,i remember pluto being the only planet without a photo in my middle school text books they used a metallic looking ball instead
space,not_removed,i think its pretty remarkable how accurate the old hubble processed image actually was
space,not_removed,could someone explain the difference in the color scheme of the two images where did the blue and yellow come from
space,not_removed,this progress is just indicative of how much we still have to learn about our proximate little neighborhood in space we cant become complacent and fathom ourselves enlightened beyond galvanization we have to keep pushing to understand our universe in greater detail i want us to put feet on mars by
space,not_removed,twijoyim only twenty but i remember reading countless astronomy books as a kid that always included the fun fact pluto is the only planet not to have been visited by a spacecraft reading that over and over again hyped the mystery of it throughout my childhood and stoked the excitement that still bubbles up inside of me every time i consider that i now live in a post new horizons world
space,not_removed,what is the new horizons btw doing at the moment does it still have a purpose and sends data to earth or is it too far away now not interesting anymore or crashed into something
space,not_removed,i was dreading this was going to be another sends nudes joke life is okay sometimes
space,not_removed,i remember anxiously awaiting the first pictures from new horizons because i just wanted to see what that damn thing looks like no i remember going to wikipedia every once in a while to check when new horizons will arrive at pluto damn thats still five years away now i have something to tell my grandchildren
space,not_removed,i watched the new horizons on the nasa tvlive stream in which happened around my daughters first birthday years later we watched the flyby coverage from the live stream together and saw the first hires images within a day or so of the flyby earlier this year nasa announced a discoveries aside it was a very real demonstration for me of the vastness of space in the time it took for this probe traveling mph to get to pluto my little girl went from barely being able to walk to sprinting full speed into her tweens
space,not_removed,its like loading a picture from the early nineties internet but sideways every time the bar pauses i still get a little irritated
space,not_removed,arent there still much higher resolution images yet to be released
space,not_removed,can we just go ahead and rename it the planet of love i personally wanna see pluto on valentines cards this year anyone care to make me one
space,not_removed,source i think
space,not_removed,i hope this isnt too dumb of a question but how does an image get all the way from new horizon to earth
space,not_removed,can someone explain to me why we couldnt just point a telescope like hubble at it and have the same result not that i think that new horizon wasnt awesome it just seems silly that his is the best picture of pluto wed have in this day and age
space,not_removed,fun fact the possessive of new horizons is new horizonss even though horizons is plural new horizons is not this is one of those punctuation rules that nobody believes but is totally true okay now im going to hide before people who hated school come after me
space,not_removed,this has been number one on rall at least times this week so theres no way i believe you
space,not_removed,fwiw the town i live in was devastated by the reclassification of pluto clyde thombaugh is a legend in las cruces he made his own telescopes he ground out his own lenses he made awful jokes and puns and paintings about crows like where does a crow like to unwind on friday night pluto means a lot to las cruces thanks for keeping it relevant
space,not_removed,httpiimgurcomhrwqwfjpng i hope you like it
space,not_removed,so youve come from the future have humans sent space vessels to pluto yes and we have average lifespans into the can you send letters to anywhere in the world well we can communicate with other people from different continents instantly amazing you must have such great philosophical discussions actually we make ass and butthole jokes about the solar system and watch cats playing conversations with ben franklin
space,not_removed,i always thought if it as this little blue ball just like in drawings of the solar system this picture made me realize how truly lonely and isolated pluto is like a sad little moon out there in the dark
space,not_removed,before and after snapchat beautify filter im so sorry in advance for this very unscholarly comment
space,not_removed,soooo did it get its status as planet back or are we just going to assume mass doesnt matter its what you do with it because i still want change
space,not_removed,here is my take on the pluto planettransneptunian object debate so the argument against pluto being a planet is that there are so many pluto or greater sized objects beyond neptune that categorizing them all as planets would be difficult but thats an arbitrary argument too difficult to categorize thats not a reason to call something a planet or not you wouldnt classify viruses as living organisms just because there is a ton of them and drawing the distinction is difficult they are infectious particles of organic matter that dont meet the requirements to be defined as living they are their own category similarly lumping pluto and all transneptonian objects into one category is arbitrary its just a nomenclature that has no bearing in actual fact to say that eris and pluto belong in the same category is as arbitrary as saying that earth and neptune belong in the same category why do we call earth a planet and uranus a planet but not pluto in many ways earth is more similar to pluto than it is to the gas giants the truth is that the term planet has no real meaning its a categorization meant to make astronomy easier but has no real bearing in fact jupiter is an almost star how is it any more or less of a planet than pluto its all arbitrary to say that pluto is or isnt a planet is not something you can test with the scientific method the rules that the iau have created arent in the purview of science they arent like keplers laws of planetary motion they arent derived from observation or mathematical experimentation its linguistics pure and simple inconstant and subject to change over time to make a hard and fast rule thats supposed to permanently pigeonhole an entire class of celestial bodies is foolish as such i choose to call pluto a planet i can do so because it doesnt matter that i do so either the iau ruling should go deeper and truly categorize every celestial body in a methodical complete manner or its an arbitrary ruling that could just as easily and validly say that pluto is a planet and all other transneptonian planets are not
space,not_removed,are there any similar projects in the works that will take years and years to see results its truly incredible how little we know about our own solar system let alone deeper space
space,not_removed,can we put satellites into other planets orbits if so have we already done that
space,not_removed,does anyone else find it strange that we can see other galaxies in pretty decent detail but our picture of pluto is a hot mess
space,not_removed,i was really into science when i was little so whenever we had a draw the solar system project in elementary i wanted mine to be as accurate as possible i would use photos from the textbook and try to do it as precisely as possible i would use greenyelowish colors for pluto i envy the quality photos todays kids have as references for their own solar system projects then i remember pluto isnt a planet
space,not_removed,thank you for this this post gives great perspective on this achievement
space,not_removed,im not sure that first picture even qualifies as a view basically we had no idea what the surface looked like also have you heard about pluto not being a planet anymore thats messed up right
space,not_removed,i remembered me being so fucking gullible and falling for the stupidest rumor that my cousins came up pluto was blown up by scientists
space,not_removed,seenow that im seeing it clearly i think it might actually be a dwarf planet
space,not_removed,that isnt pluto thats the town i lived in as a child in the frozen wasteland minnesota
space,not_removed,do you think the giant smudge was from a major impact that formed charon
space,not_removed,the clear picture helped prove it wasnt really a planet pluto was my favorite planet
space,not_removed,eww pluto i traveled all this way and you look nothing like your profile pic
space,not_removed,its like waiting for images of porn to load with the early internet
space,not_removed,mustve been the only one waiting for some text to show up saying send nudes idk
space,not_removed,truly fascinating its just i couldnt help but expect the big reveal to be a poorly written send nudes
space,not_removed,looks just like a vs pro comparison video joking aside this is amazing
space,not_removed,whos going to tell op about the internet and blow his fucking mind
space,not_removed,its all made up you cant trust an intelligence agency like nasa with their scientific biased funny growing up we were shown images of pluto depicted as grey in color even the artist renditions it was shocking back even back in to see the hubble images showing its true brownish hue
space,not_removed,how can we have beautiful hubble photos of faraway galaxies but not of pluto
space,not_removed,i love how modern software has made it possible to convert these into flyover terrain maps
space,not_removed,but dont you think im gonna be calling you planet —lt dan taylor
space,not_removed,and this is from a decade old probe imagine what we will see next time we fly past it
space,not_removed,i remember when i first saw those pictures it was almost hard to believe i was actually seeing a full picture of it ever since i was a kid it always bothered me we had a picture of every planet except pluto i never though id actually get to see a full picture of it but i did and way sooner then i ever thought
space,not_removed,this is the image i was dreaming of since reading a book about the voyager spacecraft in the as a kid

space,not_removed,what is the correlation between the two images also can new horizons imagery be used to improve the resolution of long distance imaging
space,not_removed,in the old picture theres a bluishgrayish spot just a tiny bit north east from the center as the update slides past that spot it doesnt look like its any different that other grayish areas im wondering why its got the bluish color or maybe im just imagining it
space,not_removed,i just love that the explanet we associate with death and destruction has a little heart on it
space,not_removed,i was always told it wasnt even a sphere it was some weird abomination that was too far from the sun to form a proper sphere
space,not_removed,in the decades to come the new photo will look like the old one technology is great
space,not_removed,will the james webb telescope be able to image pluto enough to clearly see features
space,not_removed,look like a moon but the difference is moon surfaces dark spot and here pluto have a white spot
space,not_removed,what if its just the moon from a different angle with negative and sepia filters used on the imagery
space,not_removed,this is why people were so excited we finally got to find out what the hell was on the surface
space,not_removed,is it actually that colour like if you had normal daytime on earth light shining on it would it look like that would it look like that if you were in orbit around it
space,not_removed,the heart shape was made by the local inhabitants in an attempt to be reclassified as a planet
space,not_removed,seriously as a kid i was fascinated by our solar system still am and i would just flip through textbooks that had pictures of all the planets but was so disappointed when that blurred picture was the best view we had of pluto back when it was still classified as our planet the fact that my year old niece who is also fascinated by our solar system will now have amazing pictures of pluto to look at thats simply mind blowing to me
space,not_removed,scientist this is a big step on our understanding of this planet we sent a spacecraft past a distant planet traveling at a huge speed and it was able to scan the composition of th commoners oh look it has a heart shape scientist anyways i was sayin commoners that heart shape is sooo cute scientist －‸ლ
space,not_removed,from the flyby we know the the surface is a combination mainly of nitrogen ice water ice methane ice and tholins the red stuff we know the spatial variation of their proportions gravity data gives us densities and assured us of a rocky core giving constraints on its size the visual images are mainly there for outreach but revealed a more interesting world than we could possibly have imagined the convecting heart especially is an unbelievable find source worked with new horizons scientists
space,not_removed,i dont see a heart shape i see pluto the dogs head
space,not_removed,this is also why the james webb telescope launching in is going to be fuckin doooooooooope
space,not_removed,longtime listener first time caller whats the point of missions like this how do we apply this knowledge
space,not_removed,i was expecting to see send nudes after that star wars wipe transition so disappointed
space,not_removed,you can see pluto has a broken heart from being demoted
space,not_removed,but you most admit the little drawings of pluto holding the heart were damn adorable
space,not_removed,i think it was more interesting that it had an atmosphere
space,not_removed,its strange to think that there will be a generation growing up that will use these hd images instead of the prerendered predicative ones in science classes etc
space,not_removed,i remember when i was in school before it was even considered a dwarf planet it was just a little blue disk
space,not_removed,it isnt a heart shape its pluto the disney character
space,not_removed,and they also successfully shot the gap between pluto and its moons coming closer to the surface of pluto than the diameter of the planet itself
space,not_removed,seconds off the prelaunch prediction there were multiple trajectory corrections as well httpsenwikipediaorgwikinewhorizonstrajectorycorrections
space,not_removed,i have heard the httpsenwikipediaorgwikipioneeranomaly referenced for this but i dont know
space,not_removed,i think its more amazing that they were able to calculate the time of travel over such a huge space down to a few seconds
space,not_removed,under budget and ahead of schedule
space,not_removed,what was the overall effect of it arriving seconds early that almost seems more like an error then a good thing did this improve the quality of this image by seconds of distance to the surface is this common is seconds substantial amount
space,not_removed,and when the lack of photography became too embarrassing they simply declared it not a planet
space,not_removed,in a presentation some man did for my class he described pluto in the picture as a disco ball and told us how that in a few years we would actually get a decent photograph of it once the spaceship reached it disco ball it really did look like one
space,not_removed,and now we have a whole new bigger farther planet nine that nobody even knows where it is to take pictures of
space,not_removed,i always thought it was a blue ball
space,not_removed,i had always seen artist depictions showing a conventionally cold and rocky surface
space,not_removed,yeah those six pixels were really impressive surprised it looked circular
space,not_removed,the hubble image is heavily processed basically it took many photos in which pluto was barely a pixel and then based on the known rotation rate of pluto they used the brightness from each image at different times to work out the approximate brightness and color of patches on the surface and the blurry result is the absolute best they got out of all that processing since it was already a huge approximation and not taken with the same exact color filters as new horizons the difference in colorcontrast was probably just down to the opinion of whoever did the final conversion from raw data to internetready color image remember the primary goal of all that data gathering was to get raw science data which contains more info than can be displayed in a jpeg someone had to turn it into a subjective visual representation just like choosing the exposure and white balance settings on a camera
space,not_removed,also worth noting that high res image isnt true color i think image is a fair bit more saturated since the low res image was made by basically seeing what color pluto was on average at a given moment you can explain the yellowness as the lighter portions being slightly blended with some of the redder portions giving them a yellow hue overall
space,not_removed,yes im all for invading the robot planet soon it will belong to humankind
space,not_removed,what well have it done earlier than that—i believe itll be tops unless the government do some intense antispace colonization stuff
space,not_removed,yes boots on the ground on mars go merica
space,not_removed,its supposed to happen by mid i cant wait
space,not_removed,i am pretty sure boots will be on the ground before
space,not_removed,yeah but because pluto lost its planethood and became a dwarf planet it lost that and then even lost being the first dwarf planet to be visited ceres has that honour
space,not_removed,its currently on its way to a rendevouz with a small kuiper belt object which it will encounter on januari
space,not_removed,its headed
space,not_removed,still screaming along at kmh going weeeeeeeee towards a few more things to take pics of
space,not_removed,last id heard it was still transmitting data from the flyby its supposed to take a while edit i was wrong it finally finished in the end of october
space,not_removed,iirc it has targeted a kbo to visit next according to wikipedia
space,not_removed,why would it be i dont get both your and uguaponess his comment
space,not_removed,my name is burned to a cdr thats fixed to the side of the probe seemed like an eternity away when it launched
space,not_removed,and then it stops loading right before the plutos nipples
space,not_removed,not of pluto the last bits of data from the july flyby were sent back in october yes thats like months the bit rate out at plutos orbit is very low here are the two highest resolution images ever released httpswwwnasagovsitesdefaultfilesthumbnailsimagenhcratersmountainsglaciersjpg and click to zoom on this one my favourite
space,not_removed,no at the point everything has been downloaded and released higher resolution shots of smaller areas exist
space,not_removed,why should we call it that
space,not_removed,it gets transmitted using radio waves new horizons has a radio dish as seen which it uses to transmit back data that data is then picked up by huge dishes on earth like
space,not_removed,not a dumb question radio transmission at a very small rate
space,not_removed,the same way you get phone calls on your mobilecell phoneradio waves
space,not_removed,weve done that httpwwwboulderswriedubuieplutohrcmaphtml are composite images of pluto taken by the hubble hubbles acuity is amazing but still nowhere near as good as getting right up to an object to photograph it
space,not_removed,the first picture was taken by hubble hubble is a powerful telescope but pluto is too small to be able to see much hubble is good at seeing really large objects that are really far away and emit a ton of light pluto is pretty far away and doesnt reflect much light you would need an absurdly large telescope to capture enough light to get a picture similar to the second image it is basically impossible the only way to get a good picture is to get close and take one and im curious as to why you think we should have better pictures the pictures we have of pluto are pretty high resolution and look amazing to me you can see tons of detail if you google it you can find the ultra high res versions
space,not_removed,same reason you cant point your phone camera at something far away and get a perfect picture its really far away though your question is probably more in the lines off why do we have such great pictures of entire galaxies but not off our own backyard the answer to that is that those galaxies give off their own light and you need light to take a picture the only light that comes from pluto comes from our own sun and it has to travel the entire distance to it to times the distance between the earth and the sun or billion km to billion km twice so a better comparison is comparing a picture off a far away well light hollywood sign or a candle thats still pretty far away
space,not_removed,because we dont have a thick enough lens to see it that clearly the picture was taken literally millions and millions of miles closer to pluto than any on earth
space,not_removed,pluto not being a planet doesnt mean it isnt relevant no astronomers think that if anything it became even more relevant as the first in an entirely new class of solar system body discovered almost a hundred years before anything else like it was found
space,not_removed,was ben franklin even aware that other planets were things that could be visited
space,not_removed,so youve come from the future have humans explored the whole earth yeah weve circled the earth can you travel to anywhere in the world yeah i could take a ship to europe and then go to africa and from then to the indias and china amazing you must have such great philosophical discussions actually i still have plenty of slaves conversations with ramses ii
space,not_removed,well its hanging out with charon
space,not_removed,this was the comment i was looking for cheers
space,not_removed,why do we call earth a planet and uranus a planet but not pluto because it has not cleared its orbit around the sun of other objects that is one difference between the objects we call planets and the rest of the stuff
space,not_removed,inconstant and subject to change over time and this exactly why a definition was adopted yes the definition was arbitrary but the point was to standardise scientific nomenclature the last thing you want in scientific field is for a definition to change because it makes referring to past work and data difficult its even worse when there is no exact definition by adopting criteria rather than ringfencing as you suggest a classification is complete and more methodical the iau seeks to standardise nomenclature for professional astronomers you are welcome to call it whatever you want why even call it pluto the definition is to simplify the work of research astronomers not satisfy a linguist or you
space,not_removed,are you an expert im sorry but i think ill choose to take the word of actual scientists and committees over the words often repeated en masse of a bunch of randoms on the internet why do people get so triggered by the notion that pluto is not a planet let the actual adults do the talking
space,not_removed,yup solar system exploration is fun like that it can take decades to go from the planning stages of a mission to actually seeing it fly and then years more until it actually arrives theres numerous missions to mars being built for the next decade of mars exploration and a europa mission europa lander mission tentatively scheduled for the mid nasa europe and china are building mars rovers to land in as well as a new mystery nasa mission to either venus or the asteroids thatll be unveiled within the next days europes building a jupiter orbiter to study jupiters moons callisto and ganymede and chinas planning something jupiterrelated too loads of robotic moon missions are planned within the next years landers rovers even a chinese samplereturn mission these missions are being done by japan south korea china and even private companies competing under the httplunarxprizeorg theres a bunch of telescopes being planned too in tess will launch which will discover thousands of new exoplanets in jwst will launch the most powerful space telescope ever that cost billion dollars and years to build chinas planning their own hubblesized observatory for the earlymid and finally theres nasas wfirst a hubblesized telescope but with httpswfirstgsfcnasagovimageswfirstvshubblepng times the field of view there are a lot of asteroid missions planned two of which have already launched and are on their way to their respective asteroids now nasas osirisrex will arrive at asteroid bennu in take a sample of asteroid rock and return it back to earth japans will arrive at asteroid ryugu in and will take a sample and return it to earth too oh and did i mention will also land three mini hopping landers on the asteroid and deliberately shoot a missile laden with explosives at the surface to excavate the asteroids interior and theres also a solar sail mission to an asteroid launching in none of these asteroids have been imaged before so well be seeing brand new miniworlds for the first time the best bit
space,not_removed,yup lots and lots of times we call them orbiters rather than satellites ignoring all the space missions of the past and only focusing on those operational today right now we have an orbiter around venus orbiters around mars an orbiter around dwarf planet ceres a jupiter orbiter and a saturn orbiter some orbiters map the planets surface and features with cameras like the mars reconaissance orbiter and some are dedicated to studying a planets atmosphere like akatsuki venus or maven mars
space,not_removed,galaxies are much bigger and brighter than pluto even when seen from earth
space,not_removed,galaxies are kind of big for instance the andromeda galaxy is full moons across in the night sky and its over million light years away the moon at only km is only one full moon across in the sky
space,not_removed,why does pluto not being a planet mean its no longer interesting
space,not_removed,nah theres nothing messed up about it
space,not_removed,i know i didnt see this post a couple days ago so im happy it was reposted
space,not_removed,hopefully we move on from gifs by then
space,not_removed,circular just isnt a good enough definition for a planet any object larger then about km in diameter is circular because when a world is that big it has enough gravity to pull itself into a sphere and worlds that size are common really common theres only one round world in the asteroid belt but in the kuiper belt beyond neptune weve found hundreds and there are predicted to be literally thousands pluto eris orcus salacia haumea makemake quaoar these are all objects around the same size as pluto and theyre all circular so thats the pluto problem in order for pluto to be a planet you have to count all these other newly discovered worlds as planets too this would clearly be a ridiculous number of planets so in the iau made a new definition which excluded pluto the new definition states there are three things a world must satisfy in order to be a planet it is in orbit around the sun it has sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium a nearly round shape and it has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit that last clause is what pluto fails its orbit is crowded with all those other similarly sized objects i listed httpwwwlunarplannercomimagesasteroidorbitsdwarforbitspng its not big enough to have cleared its orbit and therefore it was demoted to dwarf planet joining a few other largebutnotthatlarge spherical worlds
space,not_removed,the same reason you could take a picture of the empire state building and not a fly on it
space,not_removed,what is the correlation between the two images like statistical correlation i dont understand the question i dont think there is anything in particular about new horizons that helps understanding or improves telescope imaging
space,not_removed,technology is great uhh no this isnt a progression of technology the view from before is what hubble struggled to see all the way from earth orbit the clear picture was taken by a much less powerful telescope on a much less expensive spacecraft than hubble its just we decided to actually send the spacecraft new horizons to pluto back in the probe flew past and took pictures in july were never going to surpass new horizons imagery until we send another better spacecraft to pluto which isnt going to happen for a very very very long time other worlds the planets uranus and neptune that are overdue a visit will be visited first were not returning to pluto for a long long time
space,not_removed,no the jwst is an infrared telescope the images well receive will be about the same resolution as hubbles
space,not_removed,it would look roughly like that however the camera on new horizons wasnt full rgb due to the need to capture infared images and the slow transmission times limiting the amount of images they could take
space,not_removed,i thought it was for their upcoming i ♡ pluto tourism marketing campaign
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,its the shape of disneys pluto jokes on us
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,this has been astronomy with kenm
space,not_removed,are you sure its not just a fragment of a companion cube confirmed
space,not_removed,or a clever way to hide a mass relay
space,not_removed,not sure if rick and morty reference or just pluto reference
space,not_removed,rick and morty anyone
space,not_removed,love boat love shack love planet
space,not_removed,yes i was also that space loving kid apparently i refused to read any books if they didnt have pictures of planets in them congrats on having something in common with your niece that bonding thing is important
space,not_removed,isnt uranus the same problem i doubt its a smooth blue in reality
space,not_removed,successful experiment right guys
space,not_removed,scientists sell pluto heart merchandise fund research
space,not_removed,this is how they get funding for the next mission well it has this cute heart shape give them the money
space,not_removed,looks like hancock got there first
space,not_removed,this celestial body has a high degree of roundness too it when we declassified it as a planet the pr surrounding that decision almost gave you the idea it was like a floating rock or something more asteroid than planet that is not the case this celestial object has enough internal gravity and planetary dynamics to smooth out its surface to a high degree of sphericalness that is a planetarybehavior characteristic and imho qualifies pluto as a planet albeit based on my own subjective heuristical qualifications pluto the little celestial body that could and that little heart this country america was built on the belief that we can i see those same qualities in pluto
space,not_removed,me haha yeah i study quantum mechanics plebs wow like that cat that is both dead and alive me
space,not_removed,thank you so much for saying all the things i would have said if i remembered any of them source i have a terrible memory
space,not_removed,same i dont understand why no one is freaking out over the fact that pluto the planet has the head silhouette of pluto the dog on it
space,not_removed,well it be able to see something as close as pluto
space,not_removed,from my understanding when pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet it was because we had found numerous examples of planetary bodies similar to pluto in size and orbit we have very little information about dwarf planets particularly what some have named ice dwarfs the new horizons mission was an example of a preliminary survey of an environment which we could only guess until we basically could take some closeup shots we measured what we could radiation gases even the gravitational pull of pluto and of course we took regular pictures of pluto charon and their surfaces using what weve learned from missions to other planets their data and applying the principles of geology physics and chemistry we try to come to as close as possible to the truth of why pluto looks the way it does and how it got that way in the first place based on all of our previous evidence and knowledge how do we apply this knowledge one thing i noticed when they were talking about the observations was that pluto was relatively wet its °c on pluto so the water is hard as rock based on our planetary observations of this region of the solar system we know that there are other icy bodies on the outskirts of our solar system if we use pluto as an analog for them then we would have found another place in our stellar backyard relatively speaking where there is water the phrase we constantly hear is that where there is water there is life now its too cold on pluto for life to exist as we know it however this guess of having frozen water beyond neptune adds to the information we have about our solar system and can help build a standard model of a solar system that can be applied to extrasolar systems which thanks to the kepler space telescope we have found thousands of a little closer to earth the moon of jupiter europa is thought to have a global ocean beneath its crust of ice temperature measurements have shown that its much warmer than we expect it to be and weve seen fluctuations in its temperature in certain areas with the future europa clipper mission and juice juipter icy moons explorer one of the ways we will probe the moon will be using penetrating radar to confirm whether or not there really is water under there this would increase scientific interest and pave the way for an eventual probe to drill past the ice into the hypothetical ocean to look and we see whats there all of this information will eventually help us answer the question are we unique is life a special occurrence that only happens because of some random planetary event that happens every one in a billion years or is it more common and are could we be alone in the universe
space,not_removed,you can send me nudes if you want
space,not_removed,ya i cant unsee that since day
space,not_removed,that is literally something that happened not science fiction thats honestly dam beautiful and incredible
space,not_removed,like just imagine that happened to the earth by aliens
space,not_removed,if kerbal space program has taught me anything this isnt as hard as it sounds get in plutos gravitational sphere of influence then retrograde burn until your periapsis is at the desired altitude above the surface moons arent big concern due to low gravitational force compared to the planet if all you want is a flyby then thats it getting into an orbit around the planet requires additional retrograde burn typically done at periapsis due to the oberth effect
space,not_removed,doesnt seem that impressive to me im closer to my planet than the diameter of the planet
space,not_removed,straight up plutoforlifeb
space,not_removed,never mattered to me pluto will always be the planet in my eyes
space,not_removed,which discos do you got to
space,not_removed,what elaborate please
space,not_removed,i dont think its possible for an image that low resolution and that blurry to have that solid of an edge im guessing they estimated where the edge of the planet would be and cropped it
space,not_removed,this better
space,not_removed,what is raw science data in this context
space,not_removed,could an improved approximation be developed using the actual image of pluto to approximate other objects that are at plutos distance or further away
space,not_removed,i never realized it until now that we will invade a planet that has been inhabited by robots wow
space,not_removed,uhm arent spacex doing it by
space,not_removed,maybe we can have feet in the boots too
space,not_removed,who said it would be american boots
space,not_removed,we as meatbrained little monkey men have designed an object that can not only travel billions of kilometers out into space but still manage to transmit back high quality data and imagery to us it just blows my mind
space,not_removed,oddly your comment looks right
space,not_removed,years from now thats going to be pretty epic if we get pictures half as decent as the pluto pictures i think wed all be super thrilled
space,not_removed,for some perspective a really fast motorbike goes kmh the bugatti veyron will take you slightly faster than according to a site i looked up bridgeport connecticut is about km from washington dc if we actually had a wide open road with no limit and tires that are up to it veyron kills tires at top speeds the veyron could get there in an hour the probe would cover that distance in about seconds of course the atmosphere would be a much bigger problem than the bugattis tire wear but thats beside the point im trying to make edit apparently the veyron would run out of gas in minutes too so unless you rigged an extra tank it wouldnt work
space,not_removed,i dont care but if i could i would walk billion miles more
space,not_removed,thats around averagesized people on top of each other if this helps
space,not_removed,about years walking at kmh mh
space,not_removed,cuz its got a heart on it mainly other than that i guess cuz love is just a bit distant ball of cold rock we have to fly by occasionally in our lifetime which we call humanity
space,not_removed,what about when james webb launches i heard that thing is so much more incredibly powerful that hubble
space,not_removed,im curious about why the colours are so much more vivid in those images the recent images are much better resolution but they look monochrome by comparison what happened to all that yellow
space,not_removed,its probably the same confusion you get from watching year old pictures on high resolution modern monitors the entire picture in this comparison a galaxy looks pretty good everything is clear though to small to make out details but if you blow it up aka get to the scale of pluto suddenly its an impossible to make out mess of gigantic pixels
space,not_removed,brightness and resolution are two different things pluto is times brighter than stars and faint galaxies in other hubble photos its just pluto is so tiny and far away that its only a couple if pixels wide in the hubble camera it doesnt have enough angular resolution
space,not_removed,why do we have such great pictures of entire galaxies but not off our own backyard well the biggest factor in that is simply their size sure galaxies are millions of lightyears away whereas pluto is only a few lighthours away but galaxies are lightyears across and thus we can get a nice clear shot of something like the andromeda galaxy because it takes up so much of our view relative to something as tiny as pluto similarly its super easy to get a nice clear photo of a whole mountain thats many miles away whereas a golf ball is gonna be damn near impossible to photograph in detail even yards away
space,not_removed,billions actually the distance between the sun and pluto is between and billion kilometers meanwhile the earth is km from the sun the difference is a factor to
space,not_removed,maybe if he was educated in sciences then i dont see why not many scientists from his day wrote about life on venus and other planets
space,not_removed,yeah but charons kind of a downer
space,not_removed,i disagree emphatically first of all cleared their orbits of what other objects thats vague and undefined to the extreme earth coorbits with thousands of asteroids jupiter with hundreds of thousands pluto is disregarded because of this rule because neptune technically enters its orbital zone but by that definition neptune isnt a planet because pluto is in its orbital zone
space,not_removed,this is very exciting thank you
space,not_removed,isnt it a bit arbitrary that they changed the definition so there arent too many planets it seemed like an irrelevant argument
space,not_removed,correct now that we know the ground truth how good was our estimate of what it looks like
space,not_removed,i think disney stopped it with a lawsuit theyve claimed the advertising rights for pluto
space,not_removed,jerrys part of that episode was a great metaphor for global warming deniers
space,not_removed,sometimes science is about conviction youre goddamned right jerry and from this day forward i am a scientist
space,not_removed,may i ask and sorry if this is ridiculous but i see that name a lot and ive looked at his sub – who is kenm and why does he have such a following on social media
space,not_removed,when i was a kid our elementary school would have a library day whered youd have to pick out a book to read for the week i always chose the big ass picture book of our solar system every damn week
space,not_removed,while its true that uranus hasnt been explored and photographed as extensively as the other planets voyager did do a fly by and captured the best pictures that we had at the time including detailed pictures of the surface of some of its moons so i wouldnt necessarily put it in the same category as the yellow splotch that was plutos best picture until last year
space,not_removed,only if uranus is bleached
space,not_removed,people were freaking out when the picture was released httpswwwbuzzfeedcomrosapasquarellaplutothedogsfacehasappearedonplutotheplanetandits
space,not_removed,you mean small not close right
space,not_removed,they launched it a decade ago slingshotted it off jupiter and got it to pluto within a second margin of error
space,not_removed,once you know the mass of things in space you can basically make a path thatll get you anywhere you want to go with variables for time and efficiency its remarkable but we also got to the moon on basically calculators and math
space,not_removed,none also the man used a different picture than op sorry for any confusion
space,not_removed,they probably imaged a full rotation of pluto did some serious image editing to bring out any sort of discernible detail then stitched the different images of the full rotation onto a cgi sphere to simulate as best as possible how pluto looked
space,not_removed,thats exactly what is going on here
space,not_removed,this is absolutely what happened
space,not_removed,plutos got all the cool names
space,not_removed,they were looking for httphubblesiteorgthetelescopenutsandboltswavelengthsphp because that can tell you information about the composition of the surface basically the original data consisted of a few channels reflectivities of different wavelengths and their intensities at different points on the surface those intensities were represented as numbers probably something like bits so to in that case httpswwwspacetelescopeorgprojectsfitsliberatorimproc three channels have to be chosen or created by blending to represent red green and blue and the or more bits of data need to be reduced to bits since thats what computer monitors and conventional image files can deal with choosing how to get those r g and b channels out of raw wavelengths that might not correspond to those colors and choosing how to compress the bits down to is essentially an artistic choice making different choices gives you different falsecolor palettes and different contrast the same deal goes with pretty much all other astronomicalscientific observations
space,not_removed,i think of it more as our minion robot colonists paving the way for their human overlords
space,not_removed,venus too but all the robots are destroyed so we dont have to put in much work
space,not_removed,we could just take a page from israels book and call it colonizing it paints a much better pr picture
space,not_removed,elon musks timetables have a history of being overly optimistic
space,not_removed,i hadnt heard about that i also heard something about china trying to do it by im thinking at the latest get hyped
space,not_removed,but thats only years away
space,not_removed,dont knock monkey meat brains it may be old tech but its still the state of the art
space,not_removed,how do they send data from that far away like pictures
space,not_removed,the object is much smaller so much less pixels for the object
space,not_removed,then id be the man who walked billion miles
space,not_removed,it is different it will be much better in the infrared range but not in the visible range but even in the infrared the resolution is just better by something like a factor for a good resolution nothing can beat a probe nearby in terms of distance its like standing right in front of something meter away vs being kilometers away
space,not_removed,the httpsenwikipediaorgwikieuropeanextremelylargetelescope is what youre looking for the observatory aims to gather times more light than the largest optical telescopes existing today be able to correct for atmospheric distortions and provide images times sharper than those from the hubble space telescope
space,not_removed,i think the old images are false color to pick out aspects that arent in the visible spectrum
space,not_removed,galaxies are unfathomably big for example imagine our sun the size of a marble earth would be a grain of sand a foot away the next nearest star would be a marble miles away the entire galaxy the entire united states in size with billions of marbles so when you see an entire galaxy you are seeing something as compared to a grain of stand to the entire united states
space,not_removed,but if it was brighter having say the luminosity of a star wouldnt the resolution be much better even keeping size constant
space,not_removed,its so hard to picture the actual distances between objects in the solar system our brains just dont naturally function to comprehend concepts of that space that large httpjoshworthcomdevpixelspacepixelspacesolarsystemhtml was the first thing that helped me to realize how far pluto and even mars really are and why its such a challenge to get to those places
space,not_removed,interesting thanks for the answer
space,not_removed,qualitatively pretty good the relatively bright regions lined up nicely the color the redish tinge which i dont believe we were very sure of turned out to be correct it is in fact covered in parts with red organic molecules im not a planetary geologist so i cant speak to numbers but i think its fair to say that the low resolution earth based photos were accurate to best of equipments ability
space,not_removed,thank god theres still plenty of tourism at uranus
space,not_removed,supposedly because they were using for their advertising campaign
space,not_removed,i thought that was painfully obvious but someone i watched it with later didnt realize it took some explaining to set in
space,not_removed,what season and episode is this ive never seen the show but ive heard of it and this clip convinced me to watch it
space,not_removed,hes a prolific troll who gets great reactions from people online with very little and hilarious effort
space,not_removed,you may as well go to the kym page on him httpknowyourmemecommemeskenm tldr ken m is hilarious edit since this is rspace
space,not_removed,rkenm has the best of all his trolling definitely worth a read
space,not_removed,maybe learning to read could have helped
space,not_removed,very interesting and nice for me that my guess uranus redonculous tilt may be related to its boring look from the voyager flyby
space,not_removed,that was very interesting thanks
space,not_removed,would like a with you gas giants have clouds clouds swirl
space,not_removed,and i get bleach on my tshirt
space,not_removed,thanks i only saw the pluto the dog comment like twice but everyone was talking about a heart shape instead
space,not_removed,you mean small not close right
space,not_removed,as someone who struggled profoundly with the game osmos that trajectory astounds me
space,not_removed,amazing that even that close to pluto the vector didnt perceptibly change after the fly by
space,not_removed,that right there is what blows me away about the number while the technology and simulations have gotten better its still just math this could still be calculated using paper mind blows
space,not_removed,and a bigass freedom missle
space,not_removed,i still dont understand how we even know the mass of distant objects in space so mind is blown either way
space,not_removed,yeah as in most believe its orbit should be around earth years or so in comparison plutos orbit is earth years
space,not_removed,werent they able to discern the shape of pluto and the largest moon charon i remember seeing something a long time ago that showed both bodies and they explained how the light was being reflected was due to the size of that moon of pluto of course to me it looked like a smear of light but the red circles they used to show it really drew it together
space,not_removed,i can tell because of the pixels
space,not_removed,ya damn right what is that geological features or doom maps
space,not_removed,wait are those actual names i thought it was a joke
space,not_removed,theres no oppai mountain range tho
space,not_removed,isnt this the plot of pacific rim in reverse
space,not_removed,china only wants to put a rover on mars by
space,not_removed,i mean look at curiousity and the other rover our space stuff has done extremely well and surpassed all expectations
space,not_removed,mind if i use this phrase funny but at the same time so accurate
space,not_removed,plus the wifi gets real weak that far out
space,not_removed,and less light from the sun probably
space,not_removed,to fall down at your door la da lala
space,not_removed,no it would just bleed into surrounding pixels which is why stars sometimes have spiky artifacts that arent actually there stars are just one very bright pixel that can overload the sensor dito pluto
space,not_removed,no it wouldnt does your cellphone take higher resolution photos in the daytime than at night
space,not_removed,there is nothing in our daily lives that could possible compare to those distances indeed weve just not evolved to deal with them
space,not_removed,for anyone who is too lazy or on their phone you can hold down the right arrow on this page and itll take minutes to get to the end
space,not_removed,im sorry fry but astronomers renamed uranus in to end that stupid joke once and for all
space,not_removed,really i thought that the gasses surrounding uranus are so poisonous that no one can survive anywhere near uranus
space,not_removed,fun fact like saturn uranus has rings around it too but they wont come off no matter how hard you scrub
space,not_removed,despite objections from religious groups thousands of men volunteer for first manned mission to uranus
space,not_removed,people have been afraid of visiting uranus ever since they saw the alltoobrown starfish on the surface
space,not_removed,uranus actually comes from ouranos latinised version of the greek god of the sky so when youre saying uranus has plenty of tourism youre really saying ouranos has plenty of tourism
space,not_removed,something ricked this way comes
space,not_removed,it is amazing prepare yourself season comes soon sorry you have to wait youre probably already almost through season by now
space,not_removed,it took me episodes to be into it and then just about one more to love it its also great for rewatching
space,not_removed,so hes just a regular dude not a comedian or anything
space,not_removed,that page mostly refers back to rkenm
space,not_removed,well if they quiz him on planets by their satellite photos in an interview for some reason hell nail it
space,not_removed,redonculous i tried to read that as a technical term i was unfamiliar with
space,not_removed,you can see the swirls of gas on neptune its possible they were trying to say was that it was all one composition of gas as opposed to what jupiter has which i assume im not science has a mixture of various gasses edit shoot thats neptune had googled uranus looks like uranus really is just featureless
space,not_removed,im gonna feel like an astro
space,not_removed,if you like these shenanigans check out the route the took
space,not_removed,nasa had very basic computing technology back then but i bet a lot of the calculations were done beforehand
space,not_removed,math and spectacular engineering calculating the maneuvers is one thing but building a craft that can actually perform those maneuvers with such nearperfect precision is incredible
space,not_removed,did you mean kinda assuming that since alot lower than p
space,not_removed,i think they used some assumptions about the two that they were similar in composition and then used occultation to math out how big the two would need to be relative to each other letting them do math about shape and gravity or we
space,not_removed,you can tell this about the pixels because of the way it is
space,not_removed,given that we named pluto after a god of death i think these names are quite fitting
space,not_removed,yes they are real they also named the httpsenwikipediaorgwikimordormacula mordor
space,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofgeologicalfeaturesonpluto names chosen by the new horizons team but not yet approved by the iau
space,not_removed,that makes a lot more since thanks
space,not_removed,nasa has also done a hell of a job managing expectations i mean its not like when they say some project will survive for ten years that ill pause and scowl and have a think and then say now listen here seems to me like that should really last years im not saying what theyve accomplished isnt impressive its just that of course they would set cautiouspessimistic expiry dates for the projects better to have the excitement of things lasting longer than expected than things falling apart earlier than planned
space,not_removed,you joke but building radios to work on spacecraft is a real job and it aint trivial
space,not_removed,that was happening in our downstairs bathroom so we bought a wifi repeater and put it in the living room can we send one to new horizons
space,not_removed,it takes better quality is i think what many people are confusing for resolution night time photos look grainy and gross daytime photos are crisp and sharp ultimately pluto is far away and tiny which is likely the bigger factor than light shining on pluto i imagine tiny little rock vs formations that are thousands if not more of light years across
space,not_removed,the way i try to handle those scales is by shrinking the largest distance in my experience which was a trip to guanajuato i took last year about km to the smallest distance i can visualize the thickness of aluminium foil about µm thats orders of magnitude pluto is km in diameter and that corresponds to µm thats barely visible maybe a pollen grain fits earth is km in diameter so thats µm a grain of fine sand jupiter is km across which converts to mm an amaranth seed the sun is km across which is mm a ball bearing from a magnetix set the distance from earth to the sun is km which maps to metres i can easily stretch my arms out a metre and a half mars is already out of arms reach its km from the sun which corresponds to metres the distance from the sun to pluto though is much larger billion km maps to metres and billion km maps to metres thats already outside my house on the other side of the block if the sun is here in nogales proxima centauri is somewhere near guaymas km away its about the size of a peppercorn and so on
space,not_removed,well whatd they name it
space,not_removed,its sort of ironic because it took them years to come up with the planets name and out of planet king george not joking herschel yes really and ouranos they called it uranus after where they pulled its name to be fair he did discover it
space,not_removed,i dont think weve actually sent a probe to uranus yet so all weve got to work with is conjecture hearsay and analysis at a distance
space,not_removed,dont forget how dirty uranas is
space,not_removed,oh people definitely want to wear protective gear when getting anywhere near uranus that is absolutely essential
space,not_removed,actually some scientists are now saying that the rings of uranus are an illusion of light passing through holes in a dense atmospheric gas thus not actually being rings like we see on saturn
space,not_removed,this was the first time i ever heard that joke i was or reading an astronomy book i turned to my dad and said innocently did you know uranus has rings my dad made a confused face and turned his head to check my mom smacked him in the arm and he laughed
space,not_removed,i actually heard that it was spotted deep below the surface at the bottom of a crevasse
space,not_removed,hes a professional comedy writer
space,not_removed,tbf that is the best repository of his work
space,not_removed,interestingly uranus has more variety to its gasses than jupiter it has lots of fun stuff jupiter doesnt have much of like methane and ethane which is why its blue we dont know why its so featureless though particularly as neptune which is a little smaller and a little more massive but otherwise extremely similar has much more apparent cloud activity
space,not_removed,such a beautiful planet i hardly ever hear anything about it either at least it seems that way
space,not_removed,great share that was a pretty awesome watch
space,not_removed,those computers handled the onboard navigation which is a trivial task to actually computing the spacecrafts path i imagine most of that would had to have been done by hand as the tools used today are likely highlevel simulations
space,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikidecimalmark
space,not_removed,silly europeans use where should go when it comes to numbers
space,not_removed,well mainland european countries and thus its excolonies use to separate every third digit from the right and use as the decimal point while the british empire aka everyone else use to separate every third digit from the right and use as the decimal point funfact since canada was a french and british colony they use both depending on whether you are using french or english
space,not_removed,what others said before me seems to me like you really precisely measured a or you used to many decimals probably the same as seems to you i should try to get used to using both to be clear for everyone on the internet
space,not_removed,occultation they consulted oracles and soothsayers
space,not_removed,how neat is that
space,not_removed,comparing it to wifi is a really good way to the impact of the inverse square law on astronomical radio communication really
space,not_removed,this is an interesting thought i know dick all about this kind of stuff but could one or more additional craft be launched shortly after a craft similar to new horizons following behind it with a boosting device to magnify the signal trasnmission and help it get back to earth with greater clarity and from longer distances if that were possible we could potentially see some really out there shit
space,not_removed,thats an excellent point i forgot resolution has a scientific meaning that is not quite the same as the normal use of the word
space,not_removed,urectum here let me locate it for you
space,not_removed,todo send probes to uranus
space,not_removed,not sure if whoosh or clever wordplay
space,not_removed,probably hard to analyze from such a distance
space,not_removed,we know a deep probe towards uranus would be like thrusting a probe into a black hole the probe would explode now a manned mission to uranus an asstronaut would likely prefer to enter a black hole rather than enter the atmosphere surrounding uranus
space,not_removed,we have indeed sent a probe to uranus voyager ii which
space,not_removed,what a great source although it definitely leaves me with more questions it was very informative thanks
space,not_removed,so youre saying that the halo effect around uranus is actually lens flare
space,not_removed,ah that was a pleasant suprise
space,not_removed,hmmm as an astronomer ive heard this theory before but i dont have time to check your source at the moment ill save it for later
space,not_removed,that was actually a really entertaining video had to watch the whole thing thanks for sharing
space,not_removed,your source is impressive a notable orator while i expected to be bored or fooled i was neither thank you for enlightening us
space,not_removed,what made him famous was there a facebook message or tweet he did years ago that catapulted him sorry for the questions ive been genuinely curious about this man for a while
space,not_removed,and it turns out voyager just visited it at a bad time in its orbit if it visited later it wouldve found it had as much cloud activity as the others like this this is still up for debate but the working theory here is that without any internal heat changing sunlight patterns are the only thing that controls the climate of the planet based on what uranus is made of and the thickness of the atmosphere there seem to be a full season lag between sunlight and temperature so the temperature is most equal between hemispheres right around solstice meaning boring times at equinox meanwhile the temperature difference is maximized and it can form all kinds of interesting weather patterns by tapping into that difference in energy between hemispheres
space,not_removed,which is a little smaller and a little more massive i know what you mean scientifically but this is still a funny sentence
space,not_removed,i thought it had to do with its phase in orbit look now
space,not_removed,silly americans use where should go when it comes to numbers
space,not_removed,on france we just use space for third digits and comma for decimals so the numbre is here
space,not_removed,i dont see why not but the costs would be prohibitive and its not that necessary spacecraft like new horizons run out of power to run their science instruments well before they get to a point where we cant receive a signal from them anymore consider voyager which is the farthestaway manmade object there is we can still talk to it its just losing its ability to run instruments
space,not_removed,urectum ukilledem
space,not_removed,voyager is our one and only flyby of uranus and neptune an orbiter would be nice
space,not_removed,what if its neither
space,not_removed,im so glad they renamed it to urectum to end those stupid jokes once and for all
space,not_removed,have to keep it fair and balanced
space,not_removed,i wouldnt pretend to be knowledgeable enough to know the answer to that any experts on here
space,not_removed,nah uranus is pretty enormous everyone thinks so
space,not_removed,if you analyze long into uranus uranus will also analyze into you
space,not_removed,its payton manning isnt it edit damn close
space,not_removed,years of trolling made him famous it wasnt one specific thing
space,not_removed,no clearly a simple catapult would not have lifted his profile so prolifically
space,not_removed,heres an interview with him from earlier this year
space,not_removed,what does he mean
space,not_removed,same here in sweden why add dots
space,not_removed,rectum i never touched em
space,not_removed,reckoner i barely knew her hope this was the inspiration for this
space,not_removed,rectum i barely knew em
space,not_removed,really shepard
space,not_removed,the ice giants neptune and uranus are pretty understudied in my opinion the only mission to ever go near these planets was with voyager in the and it was just a flyby while theyre not the most visually attractive planets theyre thought to be the sort of bodies that make up the majority of planets in the universe so learning more about them would be very helpful in our understanding of how solar systems form im not sure if you were asking a serious question but i wanted to share
space,not_removed,i thought the same thing and was then further duped when being sure of safety because it was not an imgurcom page
space,not_removed,thats fair i wasnt thinking edit wrong word usage
space,not_removed,it is smaller but dense or composed of heavier elements so it has more mass as opposed to the usual colloquial meaning of massive which is very large
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,the one of the grid fin were badly burned when the rocket was in the return fase in that moment the stream failed
space,not_removed,i finally feel like we are really entering a new space age so excited
space,not_removed,too bad the live stream went out it would have been cool to see the landing
space,not_removed,theres bound to be one soon i bet
space,not_removed,yeah in watching the broadcast the speakers were saying that its a satellite link for the live feed and the link sometimes cuts out but once they get the recorded video im sure well see it
space,not_removed,my favorite planet it is gorgeous and helps protect us
space,not_removed,this is absolutely gorgeous is this color corrected im afraid i dont know much about how we capture pictures of other planets
space,not_removed,this is stunning im so accustomed to seeing the lines and layers in a horizontal pattern that this almost looks like something other than jupiter
space,not_removed,that one solid black ring towards the bottom left of the picture is fucking brutal
space,not_removed,im new to this planet pics is this pics true not edited
space,not_removed,doubtfully true color probably uv or something
space,not_removed,is a video of when this thing launched one of my favorite launch videos ever over here we scrub launches for a little wind in russia
space,not_removed,i dont think the ussrrussia gets enough credit for how perfect soyuz was engineered
space,not_removed,how does soyuz handle cold weather wasnt that a huge issue for the shuttle
space,not_removed,wow those bright pretty colors poking through the snow is beautiful looks like something out of a video game
space,not_removed,deleted
space,not_removed,this honestly looks like it would be the opening to an awesome bond movie
space,not_removed,revilbuildings i know its not technically a building but you see what i mean
space,not_removed,honestly if it wasnt for the couple standing in the bottom left this would look like scifi concept art

space,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment shuttle problem was one seal for solid booster was leaking the rubber was frozen and loosing flexibility second accident was due to big ice chunk from tank fall off and hitting wing leading edge soyuz has no solid booster nor wing its monolithi thats not even conjecture the morgan thiokol engineers who designed and built the srbs point blank told nasa not to launch their management went over their head if you have an hour to spare i highly reccomended challengera rush to launch here is a video of when this thing launched one of my favorite launch videos ever over here we scrub launches for a little wind in russia im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch ill keep this updated as long as i can httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get me on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
space,not_removed,remove the people and i envision this as a scene from rocket town in with snow
space,not_removed,soyuz flies to space station in blizzard meanwhile we have major pile up on hwy in of snow
space,not_removed,am i the only one that thinks this looks exactly like that scene in ff vii
space,not_removed,i now have a lot more respect for roscosmos nasa scrubs flights for a breeze
space,not_removed,yes its based on an icbm meant to launch in all weather conditions yes they had to design around the temperature range around the launch site but damn thats impressive i mean you could do the job with the precision of a swiss watch but its nice to see a big hammer at work in blizzard conditions no less d
space,not_removed,i remember reading that norm thagard the first american to ride a soyuz asked one of his crew members if they might scrub the launch due to weather the answer was only if there is a hurricane hurricanes are somewhat rare in kazakhstan
space,not_removed,and theres a freakin angry bird hanging from a control panel by a wallet chain this is video would give nasas range safety officers an aneurism seriously though that snowstorm probably wouldnt stop nasa either unless the upper air winds were too heavy you can see that the cloud cover is thin enough to provide a view of the engines all the way up nasa generally has no problem launching in heavy rain but then again a snowstorm on the florida coast would be pretty bizarre i suspect they dont have snowblowers at the cape
space,not_removed,that noise at the beginning is god telling them theyd better scrub the launch or else russians dont care
space,not_removed,in russia do they scrub anything for anything
space,not_removed,yup good old soyuz is the reason they have luxury of taking their sweet time with federation development there is no rush because old gal simply works
space,not_removed,russian cars also last for ever they make some fine stuff nothing too flashy
space,not_removed,it has a lot of separation events that might go wrong like the where the stage failed to separate from the core it was and still is a great design but it is far from perfection
space,not_removed,it has had its
space,not_removed,shuttle problem was one seal for solid booster was leaking the rubber was frozen and loosing flexibility second accident was due to big ice chunk from tank fall off and hitting wing leading edge soyuz has no solid booster nor wing its monolithic liquid fueled rocket historically until the last launch pad soyuz was prepared for completely outdoor launch ala icbm launch from vostochny note how gentle and smooth soyuz launches compared to other rocket its been tuned over flight no more violent shaking
space,not_removed,soyouz is originally derived from the intercontinental missile intercontinental missiles need to be able to launch from any weather while the modern soyouz is different from the original missile there is a lot of fondamental design choices that were made to make it as all weather as possible
space,not_removed,dammit redditors think alike i was hoping someone would answer this i would guess that the soyuz was simply designed for cold weather to begin with challenger failed because of an oring that was frozen and brittle there are all kinds of different types of rubbers used in orings and their temperature performance varies greatly an oring designed for °c might be basically liquid at °c conversely rubber that seals just fine at °c might be a very brittle rock at °c forming a tight seal across a wide temperature range is always a challenge edit to conjecture further im willing to bet that nasa engineers knew that this oring wasnt ideal at those temperatures but switching it out was too much trouble also just the act of switching it out with an oring material that hadnt yet been used on the shuttle might have required more testing off the shuttle
space,not_removed,as a floridian this concerns me
space,not_removed,russian hardware american hardware
space,not_removed,the shuttle was designed to launch from florida soyuz was designed groundup to go from siberian conditions its also derived directly from an icbm design and if the alarm went up icbms had to launch regardless of weather shuttle and civilian rockets like ariane or falcon can pausescrub the launch and wait for weather for this reason soyuz is more robust but heavier than comparable launch platforms which reduces efficiency less payload but gives it a wider launch window its not a stateoftheart bit of delicate engineering its a rugged soviet tractor of a launcher
space,not_removed,the shuttle launched from central florida something tells me the russians designed things to work reliably in freezing weather
space,not_removed,i dont mean to be a smartass but the average temperature in baikonur in jan feb is degrees c if soyuz had a problem with the cold it would have shown up by now
space,not_removed,i was going to say it looks futuristic
space,not_removed,its sobering to me what would an old caveman think if he saw this with the understanding that it wouldnt hurt anyone i put myself in those shoes and its fuckin beautiful humans are awesome space is awesome science is awesome
space,not_removed,my first thought was that snow map in goldeneye
space,not_removed,looks like a mako reactor from final fantasy vii to me
space,not_removed,i wish video games looked like that
space,not_removed,wow thats really well done nice
space,not_removed,the fuel they use is cooled so much that even launching in antarctica wouldnt make a big difference in how fast it warmed up
space,not_removed,hurricanes are somewhat rare in kazakhstan bur burans are very common httpsenwikipediaorgwikiburanwind speed of wind can be over ms which qualifies as hurricane
space,not_removed,challenger freezing over didnt stop nasa the from launching we all know what happened as a result
space,not_removed,they always hang something in front of the camera on soyuz launches to give a clear visual indication of when zerog starts i do wonder if us launch companies have formal snow guidelines given that the cape is unlikely to ever see snow its an interesting question
space,not_removed,those little charms are there on every mission
space,not_removed,the soyuz has outlived four or five different replacement spacecraft including two that had flown successful test flights before being canceled httpsenwikipediaorgwikitksspacecraft and httpsenwikipediaorgwikishuttleburan
space,not_removed,sorry mate but our cars are piece of shit they lasted forever just because people couldnt afford another one basically you cant drive without fixing something all the time we have a joke about ladacar brand if you drive far far away from city into the forest turn off the engine and listen very hard you will hear how lada decays
space,not_removed,the soyuz itself has had a good number of module separation failures prior to reentry even in recent years which could in theory be fatal but always seem to work out its not perfect but its robust as all heck
space,not_removed,the columbia accident wast an ice chunk it was a foam strike ground control only realized about a week before the crew was meant to come home they didnt tell them there was an issue either after that accident nasa had prepared shuttles for every next launch in case something like that happened again so the crew already up could come home safely they never needed to use that second shuttle for an emergency
space,not_removed,also the shuttle needed visual flight conditions at the runway in case they needed to attempt an rtls return to launch site a possible abort option that would require it to survive until burn out of the solid boosters then perform a complicated maneuver to set itself up for a gliding return to ksc doubtless they could land by instruments but why add to a chaotic workload there are also wind restrictions soyuz doesnt have that are related to the gliding abort contingency
space,not_removed,wow that video is beautiful
space,not_removed,nasa and roskosmos should do a commemorative event on the launch highlighting the history of the craft and the collaboration of the two agencies
space,not_removed,very much this however it must be noted that much of russian tech is designed and built around the climatic conditions you would find in most of russia that is a potentail for wetness mud dirt cold and forests
space,not_removed,what sort of design choices
space,not_removed,thats not even conjecture the morgan thiokol engineers who designed and built the srbs point blank told nasa not to launch their management went over their head if you have an hour to spare i highly reccomended youtube link
space,not_removed,environment determines design that is all florida sunny russia snowy
space,not_removed,american liquid rockets can handle cold weather perfectly fine seeing as how theyre filled with liquid and in some cases much colder liquid hydrogen it was just the orings on the big srbs that were a problem
space,not_removed,very common it was only launched once s
space,not_removed,hurricane strength winds a hurricane is a tropical cyclone and the definition involves more than just high winds there are other criteria regarding rain thunderstorms and the structure of the system that define a hurricane a buran would give you hurricanestrength winds but is not a hurricane in the meteorological sense actual hurricanes are indeed very rare in kazakhstan
space,not_removed,the good ol if it aint broke dont fix it approach
space,not_removed,can confirm am russian there are loads of jokes on how shit our cars are actually a story from when i was doing drivers ed in a lada while making a turn i heard a clang somewhere in the engine area so i asked my instructor did we just lose something to which he replied nah these cars are smart they never lose anything if something fell off we didnt need it in the first place
space,not_removed,i remember bootlegging it felt like the right thing to do the russian version of top gear and i loved how they called their stars in cars bit the domestic piece of crap
space,not_removed,slight correction nasa realised it was possible there had been a foam strike but didnt carry out on mission surveillance using dod satellites despite a number of requests from staff frighteningly similar to the attitudes prior to challenger about the o ring problem from what i understand there was about a day overlap possible that a second shuttle could have launched for a crew recovery mission before having the orbiter either be broken up on reentry or pushed out of orbit someone may correct some of these facts edit from the wikipedia article referencing the enquiry engineers made three separate requests for department of defense dod imaging of the shuttle in orbit to more precisely determine damage while the images were not guaranteed to show the damage the capability existed for imaging of sufficient resolution to provide meaningful examination nasa management did not honor the requests and in some cases intervened to stop the dod from assisting
space,not_removed,ground control only realized about a week before the crew was meant to come home thats a bunch of horse poop that mission was one of the first live streams and the spacecom forums were asking questions before it hit orbit had a shuttle in the hanger that could have been accelerated and might have made a rescue possible they didnt even try buried all discussion until opps too late anyway dont dare risk the next mission now if only we had a organization that could mount a space rescue some sort of advanced aeronautic and space exploration agency politics very much directly killed both crews both times
space,not_removed,shuttles were prepared only in case of non iss missions where crew was unable to reach safety on orbit that made these mission incredibly expensive but there was no other way to increase safety
space,not_removed,rtls the abort mode an orbiter commander refused to test and astronaut mike mullane referred to as an unnatural act of physics edit found the quote commander young on said lets not practise russian roulette because you might have a loaded gun there
space,not_removed,its built stronger better able to resist wind shear turbulence etc choice of materials seals fluids coolants etc will also reflect potential subzero launch conditions as distinct from us rockets which are designed based on a california or florida launch site that robust construction comes at a cost of weight which means it costs more to launch per kg of payload for a comms satellite this is unacceptable for a crewed launch you pay the premium
space,not_removed,thanks i havent studied up on this topic at all ive just heard it had something to do with cold orings which i happen to know a thing or two about
space,not_removed,a lesson that you should not let paper pushers make engineering and technical decisions people died for that lesson russians soviets back then learned same lesson on early soyuz launch komarov died back then
space,not_removed,this is also part of the reason soyuz capsules parachute onto land while apollo capsules parachuted into the ocean the kennedy launch pads are next to the water so in the event of an abort youd be landing in the water anyway baikonur is in the middle of the asian continent so an inflight abort results in you coming down over land
space,not_removed,khazakhstan why cant americans tell the difference between russiaussr and khazakhstan you do realise that the soviet union doesnt exist right and that they are also not communists
space,not_removed,their development program policy is even better build it let it explode and repeat until it stops exploding
space,not_removed,the lada was sold in canada it may still be available in canada some people liked them they were pieces of crap and the brunt of many jokes they were based on an old fiat design
space,not_removed,what do you call a lada with twin exhaust pipes a wheelbarrow
space,not_removed,why couldnt they have the crew do an eva and look at the wing
space,not_removed,there was about a day overlap possible that a second shuttle could have launched for a crew recovery mission before having the orbiter either be broken up on reentry or pushed out of orbit that shuttle would have had to have been prepared in an enormous rush cutting corners and skipping loads of safety checks not to mention overworking the workers also it would have had the exact same flaw foam shedding that killed columbia which had never been properly analyzed so they didnt know what the risk was of it happening again also neither crew would have had any time to train for the transfer between shuttles which would have used a juryrigged setup and been the most dangerous eva operation ever even with trained crews in the actual event they never investigated the foam strike properly and never had to make this decision but would you have rushed to launch a second shuttle its not clear it would have been a good decision
space,not_removed,the shuttle actually made it through most of the atmosphere but if it had just survived three more seconds the shuttle would have made it back maybe if they had jettisoned weight before reentry or angled differently they would have made it
space,not_removed,i believe that only happened once for the final hubble service mission
space,not_removed,if you have even more time read richard p feynmans report
space,not_removed,because a soyuz was designed in the ussr and b ussr is colloquially known as russia since russia was the absolute dominant power in the union khazakhstan was a part of the ussr
space,not_removed,i am perfectly aware of all those facts i just didnt feel like writing an essay if you are on this sub i just assume you know those details
space,not_removed,soyuz also launches from plesetsk which is in russia and almost in the arctic circle
space,not_removed,they should have but the powers that be buried their heads in the sand and refused to consider there could be damage
space,not_removed,they couldnt do a proper eva because the robotic arm was not brought on that particular mission
space,not_removed,day overlap was with no skipped checks again from wikipedia referencing the columbia accident investigation board report however atlantis was well along in processing for a planned march launch on and columbia carried an unusually large quantity of consumables due to an extended duration orbiter package the caib determined that this would have allowed columbia to stay in orbit until flight day february nasa investigators determined that atlantis processing could have been expedited with no skipped safety checks for a february launch hence if nothing went wrong there was a fiveday overlap for a possible rescue as mission control could deorbit an empty shuttle but could not control the orbiters reentry and landing it would likely have sent columbia into the pacific ocean
space,not_removed,why couldnt they have launched a shuttle with no crew arent the crew there for science and landing
space,not_removed,that shuttle would have had to have been prepared in an enormous rush cutting corners and skipping loads of safety checks not to mention overworking the workers it has auto pilot and maybe some military pilot will volunteer they didnt even do a show of hands
space,not_removed,the problem there is that at that stage mission control couldnt land an uncrewed orbiter so crashing into the pacific ocean was the best solution also the weight of the crew is negligible vs the weight of the essential parts of the orbiter but a rescue would have prevented the locv event
space,not_removed,i stand corrected on that point but there was still the issue of an extremely dangerous eva with no preparation and launching a vehicle known to have a fatal flaw with at least more people on board not saying they shouldnt have done it but it wouldnt have been a straightforward decision
space,not_removed,pretty sure they had to do some piloting on the shuttle or maybe it was docking that was manual either way i dont think they could send one up empty not an issue with the vehicles of today
space,not_removed,i think the shuttle required a crew for orbital rendezvous it certainly would have needed a skilled pilot to maintain close station keeping with columbia while the crew evad over one of the big differences between american and sovietrussian manned spacecraft historically is that all american spacecraft since gemini have required piloting to accomplish their missions while russian spacecraft are designed to operate automatically with piloting as a backup option as a matter of fact the us has still not deployed an automated docking system something that the russians developed in the this isnt to denigrate the us approach at all i think it actually works better in most cases and that the russians were hampered during the space race by their insistence on automation
space,not_removed,im not sure autopilot was added till after that crash and to add to the problems they would have had to added more seats into the new shuttle because there was a crew of on the damaged shuttle
space,not_removed,im just restating what dr nancy currie gregg has said the principal engineer with the nasa engineering and safety center
space,not_removed,there is a cool article about this
space,not_removed,at what point do they pilot because there is definite automation in shuttle flight with computers doing the bulk during take off and shuttle roll
space,not_removed,russia was the first to demonstrate automated space docking in the second is the european atv automated transfer vehicle international docking adapter is just recently being installed i dont think it has fuel transfer capability at the moment only russia and china have operational fuel transfer capability i think they dont fly the european atv anymore httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinternationaldockingadapter was launched on spx on july it was attached and connected to during a spacewalk on august
space,not_removed,have you got a source to hand on that not challenging the veracity just curious to read ill google later if you dont have something to hand
space,not_removed,keep in mind most of the piloting takes the form of giving the computer the correct instructions via the flight computers i think the only times the shuttle is truly handflown is during close rendezvous and station keeping docking and the final gliding flight to landing although i believe the first reentry was totally handflown if you can believe it with that out of the way launch is definitely automated through main engine shutdown im not sure if circularization requires astronaut input into the flight computer id bet it doesnt but i dont know im pretty sure orbit tuning and rendezvous are directed by astronautentered computer commands im not sure if houston could enter those commands from the ground if they needed to reentry burn is probably a similar situation an interesting question is launch aborts i know the commander can initiate an abort anytime they want not so on soyuz but im not sure if their input is required to successfully initiate an abort its a bit of a moot point though since for any abort except abort to orbit shooting for a lowerthanplanned orbit their piloting skills will be needed in short order to land the thing in any case for apollo i think all the maneuvers were of the type it into the computer sort except for docking and the final portion of the lunar landing which i think was theoretically automated but all the astronauts chose to do manually i dont think houston could operate the computer from the ground for apollo translunar injection almost certainly fully automated with no manual computer input required so yeah im unsure about a lot of things but american spacecraft were more piloted than most people probably think
space,not_removed,at the very latest russia demonstrated automated docking with the progress resupplies to salyut starting in and i have a strong suspicion that soyuz craft conducted successful automated docking with earlier salyuts
space,not_removed,give the lecture a watch what she says about reducing mass comes in from a question from the audience around the hour mark the video can be found here
space,not_removed,thank you for the response
space,not_removed,i really want to figure out how exactly fuel transfer mechanism work in progress cargo ship specially the connectors self sealing mechanism and how are they monitoring the leak there isnt any pictures on the net oh well
space,not_removed,the original better quality and not reuploaded for views
space,not_removed,nearly every rocket ever made from to is doing that
space,not_removed,there are a bunch of different ways to plumb up a rocket engine not all of them involve a preburner rocket to power the turbine like the ones found in httpsenwikipediaorgwikigasgeneratorcycle and httpsenwikipediaorgwikistagedcombustioncycle engines httpsenwikipediaorgwikipressurefedengine engines which use a tank of compressed inert gas to push propellants into the combustion chamber these have some scalability limits but theyre very simple and reliable so theyre common for maneuvering thrusters httpsenwikipediaorgwikiexpandercycle engines like the run some of their fuel usually liquid hydrogen through the engine nozzle once the engine is operating heat from the nozzle causes the fuel to expands to power a turbine which turns the turbopumps which pump propellant into the combustion chamber these also have some scalability limits httpsenwikipediaorgwikicombustiontapoffcycle engines take hot gas from the main combustion chamber and use it to turn a turbine which pumps fuel into the engine the engine used in the blue origin new shepard uses this cycle
space,not_removed,the gas generator cycle does not involve the preburner either all except pressure feeding are using chemical energy of the propellant in one way or the other to drive the turbine there is basically nothing energy dense enough to provide that kind of powerelectron rocket is an interesting case of electric driven pump but we will see how it works ofc there are steam driven turbines using htp decomposition like the immortal engines on the used film cooling by taking the turbopump fuel rich exhaust and dumping it past the regenerative cooled zone and it made the nozzle extension survive the engine burn
space,not_removed,bill nye can be quite obtuse though go listen to him on any of the star talk radio episodes hes on where mars gets brought up he attacks anyone without real scientific or financial backing and casually sidesteps any companies or governments that do have a real chance of landing people on mars then he will all but call anyone interested in colonizing mars mentally ill and follow up with something along the lines of but glad we have those people i wouldnt do it he lets his personal desires and opinions influence most of what he says instead of being neutral to other peoples desires and ideas edit edited real backing to real scientific or financial backing for more clarity
space,not_removed,putting a base on the moon would be very interesting it wouldnt even need to be occupied the whole time they could set up paper thin solar panels across the surface as well and they wouldnt blow away because there is no wind it would be easier than mars and would still provide a lot of research opportunities
space,not_removed,mars has about less gravity then earth would it even be possible to give birth and have children grow normally
space,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters used in this commenthttpsenwikipediaorgwikiinsituresourceutilization used in this commentjet propulsion lab california used in this commentmars reconnaisance orbiter used in this commentradioisotope thermoelectric generator used in this commentspace launch system heavylift im a bot and i first saw this thread at jun utc httpwwwdecronymxyz httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
space,not_removed,i never see the lack of a magentosphere getting brought up surface temperature atmospheric density and composition and viability of soil for crops are things we could fix with terraforming but none of that stuff will matter if the atmosphere gets blown away by solar wind and the surface crops get radiated all to shit cause theres no magnetosphere to divert solar radiation edit thanks for the info i now have a more optimistic outlook on space exploration and im leaving the magentosphere how it is
space,not_removed,people are likely never going to live outdoors on mars by the time we have the technology to terraform it to make it livable we wont need to because well probably become borg or something along those lines living in a giant dome would be fine though no need to genetically modify plants to grow without light well just have indoor farms with leds which already exist on earth mars has usable soil adequate gravity and plenty of useful minerals it will definitely be a shitty place to live at first so the comparison with antarctica is apt people do live there for extended periods though and people will likely live on mars as well the scientific opportunities will surely attract enough people to establish a small colony once its developed some more it might even become attractive for other reasons mars could one day become very rich due to the fact that a small population would be sharing in an entire planets resources
space,not_removed,would be mars colonists suffer from the home depot syndrome need pvc pipe home depot grow lights duct tape copper tubing all available at the home depot its so easy to get this stuff its easy to forget that it comes from a planet wide mining manufacturing and transportation infrastructure
space,not_removed,here i can agree with bill the first colonies are likely to be in space not on mars or the moon if you need a colony at mars it would be a space based colony moved into mars orbit pull in an asteroid to get raw rocky materials and ices
space,not_removed,a lot of commenters here who know more about mars than the president of the planetary society folks who really do think going to mars is httpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryromantic apparently not catching bill nyes contemptuous tone when he said that what he didnt mention no one has yet figured out how to land a large enough craft to transport humans on mars surface the problem is the atmosphere is too thin for aerodynamic flight or parachutes and too thick for rocketry mars orbit is way more elliptical than earths such that the energyperunitarea from the sun is about greater at perigee than apogee surface gravity is low enough to cause osteoporosis etc we dont even know yet whether a human pregnancy can be brought to term in those conditions
space,not_removed,i wish he wouldve talked about terraforming mars instead of just colonization in its current state
space,not_removed,bill doesnt get it we want other people to colonize mars preferably americans
space,not_removed,thats because if im not mistaken the planetary society supports not actually landing humans on mars but rather sending them to orbit to control robotic landers on the surface in realtime in order to protect some sort of life that is supposedly there thats their perspective its dead wrong in my opinion but thats my opinion
space,not_removed,bill nye lost me on the eyes of nye episode where he spoke out against nuclear power because people got into the great pyramids after a few thousand years
space,not_removed,yeah ive noticed this about him too hes not very objective
space,not_removed,well in that particular interview he was asked for his opinion and he gave it and i dont see whats wrong with that
space,not_removed,casually sidesteps any companies or governments that do have a real chance of landing people on mars nyes issue is not about the chance of landing but about the point of colonization he lets his personal desires and opinions influence most of what he says wow thats like totally not what mars fan boys are doing is it
space,not_removed,we honestly dont know that is in my mind the largest unanswered question we have about the viability of a colony everything else could be solved by throwing enough money or bodies at the problem not that we necessarily want to solve it in either of those ways but we could
space,not_removed,people are opposed to regulate birth even if the parents know that their children will have horrible diseases like harlequintype ichthyosis so why shouldnt martian colonists have children on mars
space,not_removed,i never see the lack of a magentosphere getting brought up its not an issue you arent going to be livingtemporarily living in clear nylon inflated bubbles yes youll absolutely pick up more rads if you are living in an unshielded habitat but shielding it is going to be quite easy if you have even modest mechanical means of moving regolith worst case for a non permanent mission the areas of the habitat you spend most of your time in have the water stored in the walls and ceiling quick shielding for more permanent living you take a strong but light material like nylon with you ultralight metal poles you place the poles around the habitat you then weave the material between them think under over and then spend your first few days using modestly powered martian wheelbarrow to scoop and move regolith between the material and the habitat with the exception of shielded doors again have some of the water stored in the top of the modules for the hours the sun is overhead or make a simple machine that fills sandbags the sandbags would require more material fabricplastic but would likely be quicker than carting regolith around more long term shielding your habitats are largely underground or you use regolith as a component for making bricks and stack bricks around the hab modules for a short term mission id do something with the modules being inflatables then id come in with poles sheeting and loose regolith to get inhab rad exposure similar to what youd get on earth for fun i have about of pv panels displayed in the model which would provide about at high noon and the tanks are actually landed ahead of time largely empty containing isru units to generatecapture usable things from the atmosphere probably wavar for one of the isru units which upon landing could quickly be used for starting soil washing experiments andor hydroponics if near the northern polar region you could take your time harvesting water ice for melting you could also have some of the water from the wavar going to a second isru purely to make oxygen and hydrogen you could also have one making monopropellant hydrogen peroxide for the return mission andor return samples as far as atmospheric depletion exactly what upimozv said
space,not_removed,but none of that stuff will matter if the atmosphere gets blown away by solar wind the loss of atmosphere is slow enough that it would happen over geologic time scales mars is the total mass of the atmosphere httpnssdcgsfcnasagovplanetaryfactsheetmarsfacthtml assuming constant loss it will take million years to lose of the atmosphere a higher pressure terraformed atmosphere will experience higher losses but even if the loss is times as high it will still take years to lose just of its atmosphere the lack of magnetic field wont be a significant problem as far as retaining an atmosphere goes
space,not_removed,but none of that stuff will matter if the atmosphere gets blown away by solar wind this question comes up a lot on rspace and in other discussions and i mean a lot any terraforming would add atmosphere at a rate times faster than the solar wind depletes atmosphere because the depletion process is painfully slow this is a complete nonissue
space,not_removed,the atmosphere gets blown away by solar wind half life of the martian atmosphere against solar wind stripping is around million years
space,not_removed,due to the fact that a small population would be sharing in an entire planets resources which would likely lead to breeding which would likely lead to a large population sharing an entire populations resources not to mention that until we have robots capable of doing all resource extraction more population more wealth for all citizens as it increases the total amount of trade and thus velocity of money happening on the surface
space,not_removed,by the time we have the technology to terraform it to make it livable we wont need to because well probably become borg or something along those lines or have ftl travel figured out and already colonized planets similar to earth
space,not_removed,would be mars colonists suffer from the home depot syndrome need pvc pipe home depot grow lights duct tape copper tubing all available at the home depot any modern manufactured item is made of an amazing amount of stuff made and assembled by many different people working on several continents he did not initially made that example to illustrate the same point but still i like milton friedman example of the common pencil i guess its also related to carl sagans apple pie
space,not_removed,pull in an asteroid to get raw rocky materials and ices theres something like cubic kilometers of water ice in the northern polar cap
space,not_removed,pull in an asteroid to get raw rocky materials and ices there are already two large ones in mars orbit phobos and deimos
space,not_removed,such that the energyperunitarea from the sun is about greater at perigee than apogee meh mars ranges in distance from million to million kilometers from the sun at million kilometers the solar irradiance is watts per meter squared which is about of what it is on earth on average watts at million kilometers its per at its per thats more like
space,not_removed,sigh thats why i wish the httpsenwikipediaorgwikimarsgravitybiosatellite had been funded
space,not_removed,terraforming a whole planet is a really really big project to put it in perspective everything people have done since the industrial revolution has only added one eighth of one thousandth to the earths atmosphere for a long time after the first settlers get to mars it will make sense to terraform just the area under their colony domes and leave the rest asis
space,not_removed,mars but rather sending them to orbit to control robotic landers on the surface in realtime indeed and when you try and argue a human could do more than a robot he quickly tries to find an exit from the topic my point in this thread is though he is not openreceptive to ideas other than his own and clutches to the same few arguments when you try and propose something different than what he is for i notice he gets a little worse about it every couple of years too i actually dont plan to give the planetary society any more of my money because i just do not like him being so closed to other ideas and using his ceo status as a yeah but i know more than you kinda thing
space,not_removed,would a space station in orbit be easier than on the surface
space,not_removed,seems odd to express opinions when information that is much closer to facts is available
space,not_removed,well the ps which nye is president of does advocate a humans orbiting marsfirst approach i dont think its primarily for planetary protection reasons i think they advocate that approach mostly because they think its more realistic
space,not_removed,well hes trying to point out that we have no fool proof methods of informing people and protecting a big swag of nuclear fuel that will be unsafe for tens of thousands of years
space,not_removed,because its not just in one particular interview mention sending humans to mars or colonizing mars and he goes on some rant about it being questionably possible at best and a waste of resources then directs the conversation toward something hes personally involved in like the solar sail or goes into a gmo rant
space,not_removed,wow thats like totally not what mars fan boys are doing is it mars fan boys are largely people that realize you cant keep all your eggs in one basket there are umpteen ways humans or at least human civilization could be absolutely destroyed and wiped from the face of the universe both of terrestrial origin and otherwise colonizing another world is more than settling a new continent its not a because we can or because we want the resources its a because we need to sending robots to mars and operating them from martian orbit for science is not the point of why we should be going to mars guys like nye are why we havent already had boots on the ground on mars its guys like nye that were responsible for the absurd space exploration initiative those folks would rather put hundreds of thousands of kilograms of space station and other silly crap into orbit and send it out to mars to interact with the planet via orbit where we wouldnt get a whole lot more info about the planet than what we already know
space,not_removed,russia will take the former method d
space,not_removed,you make it sound like they would just sit and wait until the sun blows away the atmossphere they will actively continue to terraform mars and replenish everything thats lost by solar radiation which is a very tiny amount
space,not_removed,hundreds of millions of years the atmosphere of mars dwindled away very slowly in a time where the sun was more active than it is today plus actually terraforming the planet to the point that most large earth life can survive unaided on the surface would require importing volatiles from elsewhere if we figure out how to do that then we can pretty much keep doing it indefinitely to top things off obviously importing volatiles is an immensely difficult task that all sorts of debate can be done about but the idea of atmospheric depletion not being an issue after its been solved once is sound
space,not_removed,enthusiasts believe yeah thats not how science works terraformer how can one even be an enthusiast of something that noone has ever done
space,not_removed,yes youll absolutely pick up more rads just send them to mars with a bunch of radaway it hardly weighs anything
space,not_removed,but thats all the way down there
space,not_removed,so the figure came from my memory of a less precise calculation that calculation looks right to me are you saying it isnt
space,not_removed,of mars absolutely but it would be rather pointless other than the view and having access to realtime control of assets on phobosdeimosmars and the reduced solar radiation i suppose you dont gain anything it is definitely a good thing to build for the second reason and as a stepping stone to the surface but the future is on the planet not above it even if it is more difficult
space,not_removed,probably but its not so clear aerocapture using the atmosphere to slow you down enough so that you achieve orbit but dont fall into the planet is a lot trickier than aerobraking using the atmosphere to slow you down as you land and the alternative of not using the atmosphere at all is harder still because it takes a much bigger rocket getting back home from mars orbit takes a lot less work then getting home from the surface but its also much harder to find a place to refuel on mars it is straightforward to get oxygen from the in the air and oxygen is of your propellant mass
space,not_removed,what information are you referring to
space,not_removed,well thats how it will start like for apollo you want to actually test the systems so first you make sure you can orbit the planet and leave safely with humans then you find out whether or not you can land on it with a human crew again the apollo mission is the only experience we have in visiting and landing humans on other bodies the risk assessment wouldnt suddenly change because were going to a planet further away and with a useless atmosphere in engineering sense aka minutes of terror well stick with what we know
space,not_removed,yeah but building and supplying a space station around mars from earth is much more difficult and costly it costs too much fuel to decelerate those big modules and let them dock automatically since you wouldnt want humans on it until its big enough although yes in the late eighties the plan was to build a space station around earth which would acts as a shipyard where they could build and launch ships for deep space missions the space shuttle was made these station in mind but alas it came nothing out of these original plans
space,not_removed,probably a stupid idea to bury highly valuable fuel in the ground for tens of thousands of years then
space,not_removed,because its not just in one particular interview this thread is about this one though if you mention others and use them to discredit the guy youre making an ad hominem attack
space,not_removed,what are volatiles is it life from earth
space,not_removed,cant we produce volatiles using chemical reaction on minerals or other resources there i heard that some minerals trap gasses such as oxygen and within them perchlorates are good examples they are everywhere on mars and we even use them to make emergency oxygen supplies
space,not_removed,radaway ha if we ever hope to colonize mars in worthwhile numbers i imagine some gene editing will need to be done to make us more like httpsenwikipediaorgwikideinococcusradiodurans or a similar extemophilic life form
space,not_removed,much of mars is covered in subsurface water ice of high concentration in many parts of mars if you dig down just one meter youll find material that is half water ice
space,not_removed,up the southern polar cap is dry ice the first manned mission to mars that plans to be permanent really needs to be just outside the edge of where the northern polar cap is during summer so some sort of vehicle could easily drive to and from it in reasonable amounts of time identify sections of water ice and mechanically break it off load it up drive it back and melt it i havent put a lot of thought in the best way to break the ice youd probably want it to be mechanical using an ice saw or ice chisel manually like oldschool ice harvesting from ponds and lakes here on earth would be dangerous because of suit damage a human would produce less than a horsepower sawing so even a modest electric motor would make quick work of ice something like drilling holes and then using a pneumatic driven blow to break up pieces would work too im sure testing could easily be done both on ponds and lakes here as well as in cold storage facilities with feet thick sheets of ice to quickly figure out an optimal solution and test hundreds or thousands of hours of the few best candidates
space,not_removed,boy am i glad that its frozen down there and that were up here and that its the sheriff and that were frozen up here and that were down there and i just remembered were up here
space,not_removed,i would say that if there is going to be any amount of permanence to humans being there it is easier to land on mars if you land on mars you can use martian resources to build sustain and grow the colony if you are in orbit around mars then you have to get all the resources sent to you
space,not_removed,how about if you had a space elevator to ferry people and objects to and from the surface
space,not_removed,the information that the experts presumably have if youll kindly excuse my presumptuousness are you one of the experts or maybe i didnt understand what exactly youre disagreeing with
space,not_removed,and this one interview are the same exact arguments he makes over and over and over and over and over and over anytime someone attempts to talk about mars
space,not_removed,nothing is viable until you start working on it and stop just talking about it
space,not_removed,stuff that can evaporate liquids and gases water oxygen nitrogen etc as opposed to rock
space,not_removed,nah colonists will just accept slightly higher radiation doses make it no smoking allowed and the health problems overall will go down problem solved
space,not_removed,yep were up here on top of the gravity well all comfy in our space station where it takes a lot less energy to get water from asteroids and energy from the sun is available but if you do go down there would you look for the remote i think i left it on the coffee table in the
space,not_removed,that is absolutely right in addition you get free surface gravity for the colonists
space,not_removed,i dont see anyone disagreeing about facts there are many experts worth many different opinions on the best way to start a humans to mars program said that he disagrees with the opinion of one expert i was confused by your reply about information much closer to facts i still dont know what you were talking about
space,not_removed,maybe since i agree with him i guess im more tolerant about hearing it to be honest though i could say the same thing about zubrin i wonder what kind of debate there could be about mars between those two
space,not_removed,in a way we are working on it would it not be nice to have a working selfcontained artificial biosphere before we put people on mars it is not because of people such as nye but because of the reality of our technological development that we dont already have people on mars
space,not_removed,initial waves of colonists thats fine but over generations you are talking potential for some serious dna issues
space,not_removed,deleted
space,not_removed,this is what i was referencing in my comment
space,not_removed,zubrin is definitely guilty of unwarranted excitement about his pet ideas in the case for mars he dismisses competing mars architectures because they require onorbit robotic self assembly and thats too complicated well he wrote that book when mir was being built in large part by robotic self assembly he then goes on to talk about how it would be no big deal to get hundreds of weather balloons flying on mars and returing highdefinition imagery back to earth full time both ideas suffer from being out of harmony with reality and both zubrin and nye do that kind of thing a lot
space,not_removed,would it not be nice to have a working selfcontained artificial biosphere before we put people on mars even if we develop one earth isnt mars we need to just cough up the coin and send a small group of people to mars for a year and a half with rations sent ahead of time we need to see how easy it will be to wash regolith and prepare it for growing we need to see how a few food crops will actually do in small numbers in the reduced gravity and artificial lighting we need to see how well hydroponic solutions work we need to see what would actually happen to the human organism in the reduced gravity take what we learn come back and plan a proper permanent colony we should have had this done decades ago
space,not_removed,but because of the reality of our technological development that we dont already have people on mars you misspelled lack of political will which is the only reason it didnt happen in the and
space,not_removed,ok thanks i thought it was a non sequitor and was responding in kind
space,not_removed,zubrin is definitely guilty of unwarranted excitement about his pet ideas in the case for mars he dismisses competing mars architectures because they require onorbit robotic self assembly and thats too complicated hell some of his ideas are too complicated mind you in the case for mars he wasnt aware of a lot of the stuff we know now decades later but instead of sending multiple smaller rockets he starts off with wanting to build a rocket that will deliver kilograms to mars in a single go then a chapter or two later mentions how we should use multiple delta rockets to deliver small kg payload missions to mars for soil return missions heh ive not read his living on mars or whatever the title is more recent digital publication one would hope hes gotten a little more flexible with his ideas i will give him a thumbs up though for at least half of his ideas isru units will be great for having some gasses and water ready to go upon landing in fact using wavar to pull some moisture out of the atmosphere then splitting it to hydrogen and oxygen as well as keeping some water not only gives you oxygen and hydrogen but it helps you store years of solar energy for use as in fuel cells having extra power capacity upon landing a manned mission would be fantastic you could get energyhungry things done like using equipment to move lots of regolith cut and move water ice from the northern polar cap heat said ice quickly if you have some incident that causes you to lose a large portion of your water have a power reserve in excess of any rtg you take in the event of a prolonged sandstorm like the one around when mars and mars failed due to it etc
space,not_removed,both ideas suffer from being out of harmony with reality and both zubrin and nye do that kind of thing a lot both zubrin and nye have aerospace engineering backgrounds as do i something i learned working on space projects is no single person knows everything you need teams of specialists in different areas and on big projects you crosscheck the work because everyone is capable of making mistakes when you become a lone authorspeech giver you can fall out of working with specialists who spend the time to keep up with their respective fields and can fall prey to fame syndromes everyone is listening to me and applauding so i must be right that can lead you astray
space,not_removed,we need to see how easy it will be to wash regolith and prepare it for growing we need to see how a few food crops will actually do in small numbers in the reduced gravity and artificial lighting we need to see how well hydroponic solutions work we need to see what would actually happen to the human organism in the reduced gravity much of that already has been done and is being tried doesnt require people on mars
space,not_removed,yeah by and large the modern humanstomars efforts have their roots with him so he gets credit for that the bulk of the ideas he came up with andor popularized are good and mars direct is the intellectually predecessor to anything worth doing on mars
space,not_removed,move water ice from the northern polar cap we know now that water ice is almost everywhere even very near the equator in huge amounts
space,not_removed,you need teams of specialists in different areas id argue you also need people that arent specialists in any field those people can help you think outside of the box hey this might sound crazy but do you think a would work like if we did something kinda like this using b and c and some fiddly bits you lot figure out well maybe yeah yeah something like this widget oh yeah and toss it in with that sprokect well youd need this and that for it to work oh yeah well thats easy to provide look at da vinci presumably only had art training but was a master inventor and futurist look at tesla while he went to university he only completed two and a half years before dropping out any time a space agency or company they should from a think tank that involves experts as well as average dick and jane that are science fiction fans with a sprinkling that prefer hard science fiction also toss in a few model makers or even a lego master builder list a basic outline of the desired goal and keep the room filled with food and drink for a week let the laypersons throw out ideas and the experts chime in yes that might be able to be done no that wont work because of this reason no that wont work that way but maybe we could do this instead record it all have people listeningwatching as observers taking notes on things that seem to get the sciencetrained folks excited go fromt here instead i think a bunch of bean counters give a bunch of restrictions to some engineers and other hard science folks that may or may not have any imagination whatsoever and they see to go back to the same stuff over and over and over purely from podcasts fiction and science fiction reading i developed a mars mission using bits and pieces from all of the stuff ive consumed i have a ged i drew on life experiences and input and guess what when i finally picked up the case for mars half of his ideas were ones id had ive been working off that plan of mine for a decade now and half the stuff i have in it i never see anyone else mentioning some if it i do see used regularly etc heh
space,not_removed,much of that already has been done and is being tried washing fauxmars soil on earth is not the same thing growing plants on iss is not the same as on mars
space,not_removed,in the soil its visible on the surface though at the northern polar cap two years later the shallow radar on board the mars reconnaissance orbiter took measurements of the north polar ice cap and determined that the total volume of water ice in the cap is cubic kilometres cu mi that is equal to of the earths greenland ice sheet or enough to cover the surface of mars to a depth of metres ft httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwateronmarspolaricecaps the originally cited site is no longer there however when googling the title of the citation pops right up i think this is the submitted paper pdf warning
space,not_removed,id argue you also need people that arent specialists in any field those people can help you think outside of the box that would be me im a httpsenwikipediaorgwikisystemsengineering and ive been known to think far any time a space agency or company they should from a think tank that involves experts as well as average dick and jane that are science fiction fans with a sprinkling that prefer hard science fiction also toss in a few model makers or even a lego master builder thats a pretty good description of the advanced space systems group i used to work for at boeing the larger part of the space systems division was engaged on current contracts but someone had to come up with ideas for nextgeneration projects two that grew up and became hardware were the space station and sea launch others have taken decades to get built such as shuttlederived heavy launchers now sls and airlaunched rockets which we studied but the current stratolaunch doesnt involve boeing directly they are using parts of two used for many years nasa didnt have such a group but more recently they set up httpswwwnasagovdirectoratesspacetechniacindexhtml jpl is managed by cal tech so they have always been a little more independent than the rest of nasa instead i think a bunch of bean counters give a bunch of restrictions to some engineers and other hard science folks that may or may not have any imagination whatsoever and they see to go back to the same stuff over and over and over not exactly what happens is nasa is a federal agency and pays according to the federal pay scale thats about less than contractors like boeing pay but you get pretty good job security with the government so they dont end up with the best and brightest and people who value security over ambition not everyone but enough to affect the institutional culture in order to get projects funded they have to go to the us congress every year those guys dont have much imagination and are driven by politics not engineering so its an uphill struggle as an agency to get anything new and amazing done it has fallen to maverick billionaires to do most of the new and amazing stuff musk bezos allen the google boys robert bigelow etc
space,not_removed,in the soil its visible on the surface though at the northern polar cap not only in the soil under the soil as pure or nearly pure water ice in huge amounts one single location with of ice another location nearly at the equator described as similar amount of water as contained in the north sea thats two of the biggest but smaller ones with still many km³ each are almost everywhere under just a few m of regolith
space,not_removed,what i find most facinating about the article is this their newly identified batch of transneptunian objects have been submitted to the international astronomical unions iau minor planet centre to receive official designations i remember when years ago every new tno was worthy of its own article some would appear on the cover of a magazine each was hyped in turn quaoar sedna orcus eris etc this article doesnt even give us the number of new ones discovered the response to finding a new tno now seems to be just throw it on that pile over there thats progress
space,not_removed,its extraordinary that we now realize just how small our solar system is in the context of the galaxy and universe surrounding us but can still just happen to discover massive planets in our own stars orbit may you live in interesting times that saying is a curse you know
space,not_removed,we are now in a similar situation as in the century when alexis bouvard noticed uranus orbital motion was peculiar which eventually led to the discovery of neptune he said in a press statement this i have a supercomputer in my backpack and i dont think i could deduce something like this if i had a lifetime to figure it out makes me feel dumb
space,not_removed,so most solar systems we discovered are binary systems what if planet nine is actually a small brown dwarf i mean of its as far out as they say it it no living person would see this sun actually orbit around our own and would easily blend in with the millions of other suns in the milky way it is harder to find things in our own backyard than it is something further away just food for thought
space,not_removed,hope im too late but do we know if scientists are actively looking for a ninth planet do they really feel like thats the most probable cause to the gravitational disturbances if so i find that incredibly fascinating
space,not_removed,i remember when years ago every new tno was worthy of its own article lol and in another ten years well be saying the same about goldilockszone planets in other star systems
space,not_removed,if they had just designated all pluto sized ones and larger as planets and ones smaller as minor planets each pluto sized one would be hyped funded studied and remembered instead no one outside a small minority really cares to learn because they arnt planets
space,not_removed,i could be completely wrong but i thought that we already searched for nearby objects in the brown dwarf masstemperature range and didnt find any spacecraft wise
space,not_removed,there is gravetional disturbance thats why astronomers think planet is out there planet was originally discovered by observing unusual orbits of kuiper belt objects
space,not_removed,take a look at the researchers blog httpwwwfindplanetninecom the distant and eccentric orbit of the hypothesized planet ends up tossing tnos into a particular family of orbits to quote from one of the postings here then is the summary of my reactions to each of the four now five things explained by planet nine a distant massive eccentric planet can capture eccentric kuiper belt objects into elongated antialigned orbits like the ones we see hey thats cool the planet nine hypothesis explains sedna and requires sedna to exist wow thats a really nice hypothesis that sounds pretty plausible the existence of planet nine predicts the existence of elongated distant perpendicular centaurs in specific locations and they are then found to exist holy cow planet nine is real the planet nine hypothesis explains the unusual orbit of drac and requires that objects with orbits like that will exist of course it does the planet nine hypothesis explains why all of the distant objects which have been pulled away from the kuiper belt are equally clustered any vestigial doubts have vanished at this point my main question is what unusual phenomenon in the kuiper belt does planet nine not explain
space,not_removed,pluto sized km radius is very arbitrary itd be a standard based on the first transneptunian dwarf discovered all because we originally thought it was httpsenwikipediaorgwikiplutoplanetxdisproved than earth therere thousands of tnos most of them as far as we know arent pluto sized so almost nothing would change if many tnos are at least pluto sized calling them planets would quickly get people to stop caring about discovered planets i think youre confusing tno discoveries with the dwarf planet issue we couldve made it so bodies in plutos httpsenwikipediaorgwikidwarfplanetcharacteristics were designated planets but therere httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofpossibledwarfplanets of potential dwarves already discovered
space,not_removed,youre correct the upper size limit for any unknown objects in our solar system is now quite a bit smaller than saturn anything bigger would have been big enough to be seen in the fullsky infrared surveys weve done
space,not_removed,thats good to know then i never looked to see if that was done or not just a thought that popped into my head
space,not_removed,the mission was considered a great success both technically and as a publicrelations exercise for both nations later cooperation between the soviet unionrussia and the united states included the shuttle–mir program which involved american space shuttles visiting the russian space station mir russian cosmonauts flying on the shuttle and an american astronaut flying aboard a soyuz spacecraft to engage in longduration expeditions aboard mir and also the current international space station
space,not_removed,just the other night i had a dream that the space race never ended and the soviets had a colony on an asteroid those are the kinds of dreams i never want to end
space,not_removed,i was curious to see what other gems of ignorance you were selling so i took a gander at your post history immediate antisemitism no thanks
space,not_removed,blame the shuttle for that not international cooperation americas space program has been on the decline since the final order of apollosaturn hardware was purchased
space,not_removed,it varies but vxworks mostly httpwindrivercomproductsvxworks one thing you need for highreliability and controls steering a spacecraft for instance is true realtime performance no consumer os does this vxworks is an example of a real time operating system rtos it can make guarantees about how long down to the microsecond a process will execute
space,not_removed,in addition to vxworks there are real time linux oss which have been used as well some spacecraft like the bigelow space stations genesis and dont use a realtime os because nothing they do it timing critical usually satellites are driven towards realtime operating systems because ground imaging requires precise timing
space,not_removed,years ago i was reading up about this and i discovered flight linux httpflightlinuxcom enjoy
space,not_removed,oh wow i really had no idea and i never wouldve guessed a digital input was part of that aspect of aeronautics i was under the impression something like steering was executed only through mechanical interfacing
space,not_removed,that actually answers another question ive always wondered how to tackle input lag when signaling things like a space station or satellites like you mentioned
space,not_removed,thanks ill look into it the website seems to be kind of empty lol
space,not_removed,apollo was the first rocket run by a modern digital computer the way tend to think of computers before that you could still say things were computer controlled but by simpler analog computers now almost everything is done in software
space,not_removed,for a related perspective military planes have had huge amounts of computing power for decades a lot of this is for radar and signal processing i learned from a general dynamics employee back in the early that the had over vme boards and software counted for over of the cost of the plane vme is a standard passive digital backplane this is unlike the standard pc which has a lot of stuff on a motherboard everything is on boards that plug into the backplane like a pci display card more to the present look up fly by wire which i think all the modern planes do
space,not_removed,thanks for the reply this is all very surprising to me im obviously just a bystander so this is legitimately mindblowing i googled the fbw stuff and this is almost like science fiction especially the automatic stability systems not even requiring a pilot thats insane this is probably standard fare for you guys but i really wasnt expecting to learn these details and its not even new there was a soviet aircraft in the with an early purely electronic fbw like untron described above
space,not_removed,not as fun as the other ones but this one is made from actual color data while the others were colorized the true color is the top picture while the bottom picture is what it would look like if the atmosphere wasnt orange these are made from two pictures left half and right half and they are curved like that because this is a geometrically corrected version you can see the originals there httpnssdcgsfcnasagovphotogalleryphotogalleryvenushtml more info there httpmentallandscapecomccatalogvenushtm
space,not_removed,do we have any more plans to photograph and do research on the ground of venus i know that all man has ever been able to send there burned up extremely quickly has anything changed technologically that would allow us to do further research other than a few minutes of picture taking down there
space,not_removed,it irks me to no end that nasa continues to snub venus i half wish that some of the batshit crazy nasa guys were still alive and in charge we should have a nuclear thermal rocket tug fleet a thousand little balloons floating around in the venusian atmosphere and a goshdarn manned

space,not_removed,just to toss in some more info that gold crescent shape piece on the ground is part of the landers camera lense the soviets had landed there before but the camera lense failed to come off so a full redesign was done for this mission
space,not_removed,so strange imagining what it would be like on the surface of venus ignoring the extreme temperatures what would the air pressure be like i know its approx equal to km under the ocean but does that mean you could swim through the air because its so thick
space,not_removed,it may be too costly for nasa but if a group of private companies got together they could probably send another probe to venus it would be cool to get some updated photos of the surface this and we now have more advanced technologies for collecting storing transmitting and analyzing data than the soviets did
space,not_removed,i wonder if well ever be able to colonize venusat ° and atm though it might take a while
space,not_removed,itinteresting to stress that the person of mentallandscape did a fine work of research and image processing he got in touch with ex soviet space scientists who gave him the raw images from venera missions then he seems to have done some work of image processing its one of my favourite sites on the web
space,not_removed,geometrically corrected can you explain why they need to make the corrections
space,not_removed,russia has been seeking international support for the venerad mission which had a goal for a kg lander which would last on the surface for one hour they also intended to include a kg instrument package which would be long duration and last on the surface for days at one point there was also talk of the eu contributing atmospheric balloons with a series of microprobes tensions over the ukraine crisis and other issues forced the talks to break down and in the meantime falling gas and oil prices meant roscosmos had to scale back their level of commitment so the proposal as it exists now is for a single lander which will last on the surface for one hour the long duration component and the balloons had been scrapped because of the changes to the mission profile the science goals had to be reevaluated and interest in the mission dipped a bit because it would essentially be a repeat of the vega missions from the
space,not_removed,the best bang for our buck for venus is a solar flyer it stays in the sunlit side of the planet forever and flies around at about to km above the surface where the temperature and atmospheric pressure are the same as earth at sea level it would have to be made of anticorrosive materials but besides that is not very difficult to make even landing is easy it drops into the atmosphere and starts flying somewhere before it gets too hot or do something similar with balloons to what the russians did in the
space,not_removed,well when the entire planet seems to want to kill people and instruments immediately due to atmospheric conditions and sulfuric acid rain it gets a bit harder to plan and do things
space,not_removed,i wouldnt call it a snub there were and are good reasons to focus on mars the soviets were the first to launch interplanetary probes and chose venus as it is the easiest to get to and was at the time considered the most earthlike planet they also launched some probes to mars but these almost always failed while the venus probes were more successful when nasa started interplanetary missions in earnest they chose mars because they wanted to trailblaze and not just be seen as imitating the soviets and also because results from early soviet probes and an early nasa probe too i think indicated that venus was actually a hellscape and not earthlike at all nasa achieved good success at mars every other country seems to have a bit of a mars curse and continues to explore there almost exclusively because they can reduce costs by reusing systems and procedures from previous missions there is less uncertainty since we now understand the martian environment pretty well their science is more productive because of the base of understanding they have built up about mars there are strong theoretical underpinnings that new data can be interpreted in the context of so while its sad that mars gets all the nasa love there are good reasons
space,not_removed,venus just isnt a viable planet its terrestrial sure but not only is the entire atmosphere insanely hot its also literally toxic to all life as we know it and virtually all electronics its also insanely dense being times denser than earths at sea level its a literal engineering nightmare to produce anything that can survive there for any meaningful length of time its infinitely cheaper and easier to actually build a giant orbital space station than it is to build structures that can survive and support life on venus
space,not_removed,nasa hasnt sent a probe to venus recently other than flybys but did some studies in the past including httpsenwikipediaorgwikipioneervenusmultiprobe which accidentally landed a probe on the surface that survived for over an hour atmospheric probes were launched without parachutes one managed to survive
space,not_removed,only its not snubbing venus httpswwwnasagovpressreleasenasaselectsinvestigationsforfuturekeyplanetarymission discovery missions proposals up for consideration are venus missions
space,not_removed,why get a good look at venus surface when we can send another rover to mars
space,not_removed,does that mean you could swim through the air because its so thick nope the density of the atmosphere at the surface is only kgm³ not even close to the waters kgm³
space,not_removed,density and pressure are not as intertwined as people think they are you can have high pressure but very low density such as in jupiters atmosphere
space,not_removed,i always wonder about too suppose that all of the sudden the pressure here on earth is equal to what it is on venus temperature remains the same and suppose that humans could tolerate it what changes in the context of every day life is flying different or driving for that matter what about wind gusts id imagine theyd have more oomph fuel economy what would happen if you tried to blow up a balloon what would it be like to sky dive
space,not_removed,do people swim inside submarines
space,not_removed,well just live on the clouds like the care bears do
space,not_removed,is that deg celsius holy cow
space,not_removed,its much less difficult than its made out to be dropping the temperature causes carbon dioxide to condensedepose lowering the pressure cooling the planet can be done in a thousand different ways on the other hand giving mars an atmosphere and changing its gravity are challenges that we have no way to solve without several orders of magnitude greater economy and technologies that dont exist mars is way smaller than earth the diameter and the mass and theres no way to change that
space,not_removed,more likely our machines will set up shop there i wonder whether and to what extent the extremes of temperature acidity and geological forces are able to concentrate metals and minerals there could be some very rich veins if youre able to design equipment that could function long enough to mine and tough enough to leave the atmosphere asteroid mining using ai drone swarms is probably likely to happen sooner though
space,not_removed,no but im guessing you need a pretty special cameralens to take pictures on the surface of venus and these are years old
space,not_removed,judging from the linked original photographs this image seems to be two wide angle photographs that were stitched together
space,not_removed,the soviets used a slowscan television camera to make these images theyre similar to the kind used on the viking landers the camera continuously scans across the scene while a crt reads out the signal for transmission the soviets had a couple of engineering issues that needed to be worked around the first is that all of the instruments needed to be fit inside of a pressure vessel the television imaging systems were big and adding more freedoms of movement to its pointing system took up precious space inside the vessel the second is that the landers had to relay their data through the orbiter that brought them to the planet that meant that even if all went well with the lander the maximum transmission time from the surface is only a couple of hours by the time of the next orbiter flyover the lander would be dead due to the failure of its electronics in the heat or the battery running out of juice that puts a hard limit on how much time you can spend collecting data and transmitting it that makes a camera system with the freedom of movements to collect the full scene even less valuable theres a lot of things scientists want to see at the surface is the surface barren rock or is there dust and gravel what are some of the landforms you see at distances of a few meters of the lander are there hills in the background this one is important for learning about atmospheric properties the atmosphere is so dense that it refracts light so you can see well beyond the geometric horizon and it would give you the sense of standing in a shallow bowl if you were an astronaut on the surface you cant do all of those with a camera that scans horizontally you would see the horizon or rocks at the foot of the lander but not both the solution to make all of the science teams happy was to mount the camera so that it scanned more or less vertically itd start at the horizon scan downwards to a point just in front of the lander and then scan back upwards to the horizon then itd flip to another color filter and begin scanning back across the scene if you look at the youll see the horizon is curved but less obviously the scale of foreground rocks is a little off if you apply a geometric warp to the images like the one in the op you can take can remove both those issues at once tldr its a necessity to make the choice of imaging method more scientifically useful and easier to interpret
space,not_removed,i googled a bit to see if i could find a good link id scan this one httpphotonetlearnfisheye and see wikipedia for more info httpsenmwikipediaorgwikidistortionoptics
space,not_removed,fascinating thank you i wish we could learn more about the history of venus
space,not_removed,sadly to seen the whole venera d program is basically more or less dead now it was maybe the only serious landing mission to study the atmosphere and surface of venus i dont expect sadly also that somehow nasa would send something to venus esa venus express is gone and there are no plans for a new probe japan got akatsuki at least but nobody knows how long that probe would survive and giving data maybe china andor india would send something to venus by but as so far i know all focus is more or less on mars what is a bit sadly for the rest of our solar system where we still need to learn a lot about
space,not_removed,because i never miss a chance fuck putin russia has so much to offer the world but the minute that bastard changed the constitution so he could stay in power indefinitely it sealed russias fate as a pariah until he expires one way or another
space,not_removed,you realize that practically any and every plastic is resistant to acidic corrosion right like to the point where any idiot engineering student could do the materials selection literally my second engineering class ever was pick the right material for the job as our first group project
space,not_removed,seems its definitely tumultuous but thats from an organic chemistry perspective better than the alternative mars has no significant atmosphere which means no radiation shielding venus otoh has enough nitrogen carbon and oxygen to grow a planets worth of plant life all its missing is water and you can grow algae among other things in your little oxygen filled balloons that you can make out of plastic that you make from the air in all seriousness the chemistry for inert polymers looks like carbonhydrogen from sulfuric acid heat and pressure plastic
space,not_removed,there were and are good reasons to focus on mars i agree in part while there have been good reasons to focus on mars in the past years nasa has launched stuff at pretty much everything but venus mercury jupiter pluto random asteroids the moon other dwarf planets they havent launched a dedicated venus mission since
space,not_removed,the counter argument is mars isnt extremely viable either it lacks an active magnetic field leaving it open to cosmic radiation as well as being less dense causing bone health concerns due to micro gravity ill agree venus is hellish but mars isnt perfect either
space,not_removed,this simply isnt true the havoc model a doesnt require the astronauts to pack oxygen whereas an orbital model does b they dont have to worry about microgravity or radiation exposure the latter being relative as far as engineering nightmares i disagree a challenge certainly but theres off the shelf industrial hardware that meets all the requirements for temperature and pressure electronics included although you would need an active cooling solution for electronics to stay on the surface indefinitely the pressure is right about the limit for nuclear submarines but not submersibles in general deepwater horizon was wayyy deeper than venus pressure wise finally surviving at ground zero versus surviving in the atmosphere are completely different challenges the latter being the easier of the two the problem with blimps is that they run in to things but theres nothing to run in to on venus so your blimp can basically float around forever edit also extravehicular maneuvers for havoc requires a hazmat suit with oxygen it doesnt need to be pressurized and doesnt need to be temperature controlled doesnt have to guard against interstellar radiation etc
space,not_removed,an engineering nightmare yep im not advocating we start sending fleets of robots for tens of billions of dollars but isnt an engineering nightmare a compelling reason to go in and of itself we get insane technological leaps when we start tackling those problems
space,not_removed,proposals funding there have been a metric fuckton of venus proposals but none of them get funding thats exactly what snubbing is whether its intentional or not i dont know
space,not_removed,cause photos arent the only reason why we launch space probes
space,not_removed,cars and planes ect would still be a thing but the cars design would have a far heavier emphasis on aerodynamics and lower economical cruising speed jet planes would be different but still climb to a cruising altitude that would have an effective densityliftdrag profile that they operate in now helicopters and other various vtol craft would be everywhere due to improved performance and efficiency in the denser atmosphere various animals would suddenly have survivable terminal velocities especially cats who already almost have survivable long falls
space,not_removed,no but im pretty sure the pressure isnt equalized they would need to store the equivalent of the volume of air in the sub in external tanks which would mean a metal tank the size of the submarine capable of holding psi basically a scuba tank the size of a submarine not very feasible
space,not_removed,only if their in the subs pool
space,not_removed,submarines are normal air pressure inside
space,not_removed,the care bears live in carealot you fucking savage
space,not_removed,sorry venus has that loophole covered once you get high enough into the atmosphere for humans to withstand the pressure you also get into thick clouds of sulfuric acid youd still be dissolved into a puddle of black goo but at least you wouldnt be flattened into a pancake and fried like you would at the surface i always grew up thinking that it rained sulfuric acid on the surface but now i see that its actually too hot for it to stay in a liquid state all the way down even considering the rapidly increasing atmospheric pressure all the surface sees is virga
space,not_removed,warframe alad v base style
space,not_removed,believe it or not we probably cant even do that venus is like it is partly because electric wind stripped its clouds of water its a hellscape all the way down
space,not_removed,it also rains sulfuric acid
space,not_removed,f sorry thats roughly
space,not_removed,if jupiter is a watermelon earth is a cherrytomato venus is a cherry and mars is a pea
space,not_removed,how would you cool venus using the current economy and technologies that existcould be worked out quickly the usual plan i see is some sort of starshade which would be by far the largest engineering project ever tried by man i think youre underestimating the problems caused by the pressure too even if all of the magically vanished youd still have atmospheres of nitrogen left over air needs to be physically removed from the planet to get it to an earthlike state youd need to import water too
space,not_removed,i would disagree humans seem to be very good at heating up planets versus cooling them with our current technology
space,not_removed,crash thousands of asteroids into it to increase its mass
space,not_removed,launching from venus is even harder than launching from earth so its hard to see mining there ever being economical the biggest draw of asteroid mining is that we wont have to haul bulk materials for space projects up from here anymore
space,not_removed,thank you for this you rock
space,not_removed,to be fair mars does offer the most immediate returns while creating a probe that could survive in the harsh conditions on venus would be technically fulfilling and might even accomplish some good science its also not going to further humanitys aims to colonize the solar system venus will have her day in the sun so to speak but it might be our childrens children who finally do it once the politics of climate change die down a little bit
space,not_removed,yep in landiss paper on the solar flyer he mentions that making it of anticorrosive material is not difficult i think my wording above makes it look like it is i just meant that you have to not make it out of anything that will corrode and then youre good
space,not_removed,ha looking through your comments i see youre just as big a venus fan as i am and just as irritated by the complete lack of attention it gets in spite of being right there and easy as hell to get to
space,not_removed,wed have to manage extractors that had acid and temperature proofing that could get the materials to printers or the like nevermind getting the extraction process efficient enough to work with probably best to start atmosphericsourced printing here where the machines are less threatened and work on those extreme protective measures youd need for the robots or what have you in parallel mars and the moon are weather null and dusty so thats the robot proofing we have so far maybe we can adapt ceramic heat shield technology from the shuttle for venus use im just an armchair science geek who isnt up on the times but are ceramics related though to glass physiochemically to protect against the acid and the heat i know crucibles are made of ceramic at least on the high school chem level and acids are stored in glass to a certain point so maybe
space,not_removed,a couple things mars isnt really microgravity its just a lower gravity we dont actually know if the effects would be so severe because we havent had a longterm manned presence in any low gravity environment that the effects wouldnt be nearly as severe is a pretty safe guess regarding surface radiation its not that bad you obviously dont want to go outside in a tshirt and flipflops but burrowing a couple feet down completely solves the problem of radiation or just a simple metalfoilinsulation habitat like the iss mars isnt perfect no but its the best we are going to get by a lonnnnnnng shot
space,not_removed,not a therefore not b is not a valid logical argument the status of venus is irrelevant to argument of whether mars is a good subject for study either it is or it isnt and that is determined by its own properties not venuss
space,not_removed,so heres the gist of the problem really although you would need an active cooling solution for electronics to stay on the surface indefinitely yes there are solutions that exist that can do one thing we need them to but as the probe rover or object in questions scales up in size use or utility suddenly the ability of each component diminishes dramatically building something small that can last for a little while is really the only feasible option as the object gets bigger you need stronger components that are orders of magnitude better than their small counterparts its kind of like the rocket fuel problem just for functional utility and engineering the more you have the more you need eventually you get to a point where the volume you need becomes so impractical that you need to think of alternatives
space,not_removed,true but then that requires money and nasa isnt exactly able to operate itself as it would like look at the sls for example or constellation it also requires a strong will to go out there and get it done however long it takes and however you can like the moon landings or spacexs trying to get people to mars for colonization i do agree with you in that itd be nice to go to venus ive always been fascinated by it and it was for a long time my favorite planet but absent those two things it doesnt seem likely and it looks like nasa is focusing on things that are either required sls or easy to sell mro im assuming thanks to the reasons others have posted
space,not_removed,most of the technology exists off the shelf from the oil and gas industry high pressure and temperature and corrosive as hell
space,not_removed,these missions are competed if they dont win its because either they lack engineering maturity or scientific merit the scientific community itself sets the priorities thru peer review if venus is getting snubbed its because its simply not interesting enough given the available budget and other targets represent higher priority
space,not_removed,awesome thanks its fun to think about for sure i guess vtol would be quite a bit more effective since there more mass to push against i wonder what cruising altitude of a typical jet liner would be id imagine the atmosphere would be much thicker in the context of agl so youd be able to climb quite a bit higher quadcopters would be a lot of fun maybe you could have personal transportation devices in that kind of atmosphere what do you figure terminal velocity of a human would be in this case
space,not_removed,look at mr rothschild over here
space,not_removed,its not like anyones planning to take a stroll atop a platform floating above venus weve got a pretty good understanding of buoyancy and ballooning so it would be pretty easy to get a spaceblimp to sit at a safe altitude with gas brought from earth then we could just harvest the lighter gas from venus atmosphere
space,not_removed,no prob still thats hot as heck we wont even be able to get water and metal down there
space,not_removed,i think athmospheres are not that big of a problem
space,not_removed,i posted a rough idea here a while ago
space,not_removed,well part of the problem is that there are a bunch of people living here so some of the more fun cooling strategies kicking up a giant dust storm people seem to be against for silly reasons like it would cause mass starvation venus has a distinct lack of nimbys to prevent such happy measures
space,not_removed,but a ship floating in venuss clouds would actually have more earth like conditions than mars see edit more earth like but yes it still has sulphuric acid
space,not_removed,so youre the other one haha yeah i dont remember when it clicked for me i grew up outside the states in vietnam so i have a lot more respect for and familiarity with soviet scientific accomplishments than the average american but i think i was watching a terraforming imax or something and they mentioned that venus was earth gravity while mars was like earth gravity and i was like well that means that we have to terraform venus because we can fix everything else but theres no way were making mars have earth gravity then i started wondering why the soviets found venus so much more interesting than us and it snowballed
space,not_removed,im a lapsed engineering student and and sulfuric acid is childs play stainless steel teflon various other alloys all fit these categories you dont even have to get in to anything exotic when i was doing my materials science class we did quite a bit on polymers and monomers i also worked for a microbiologist who grew bacteria to break down fats and oils its similar organic biochemistry the point is most of the hydrocarbon formations involve heatingcooling adding pressure reducing pressure on the necessary ingredients all of these conditions exist on venus naturally just by changing altitude you wouldnt need to replicate anything artificially but more importantly we dont have to design everything for high pressure and high temperature only stuff that needs to live at the surface which is almost nothing oxygen is a lifting gas so separating the oxygen from the carbon dioxide allows for generating your lifting gas probably best to start atmosphericsourced printing here theyre called trees but in all seriousness hydrocarbons using and water is what all biofuels are currently theres a ton of stuff made from corn styrene audi is making fuel straight from and water httpwwwaudicomcorporateencorporateresponsibilityweliveresponsibilityproductsyntheticfuelsaudiefuelshtml
space,not_removed,avb ab a therefore b is logically sound because currently they are mutually exclusive the status of one absolutely affects the other mars has ostensibly been selected because its the better of the two candidates if its worse than we though then that has very real consequences for the pursuit of venus exploration
space,not_removed,except that we really dont need to send anything but a probe down there theres no real reason to send a manned mission down there unless we just want to say weve done it but for example a rover or more likely another stationary lander doesnt have nearly the issues with volume that a manned mission would the soviets did it years ago and on a shoestring budget at that hundreds of millions of dollars for their missions in dollars whereas were spending billions to explore ceres etc so the idea that we cant do better years on is pure pessimism
space,not_removed,oh im pragmatic i know we arent going back there in any meaningful capacity in any reasonable timeframe but if someone were to shove a few billion dollars in nasas face with a specific venus earmark well i dont know about you but i certainly wouldnt lose any sleep over it
space,not_removed,the issue i have is that nasa is spending billions to do things like fly to ceres afai can tell theyre not going to venus because it hurts their mars narrative and theyre trying hard to sell that right now and while i get the motivation behind that i also find it incredibly short sighted and stupid
space,not_removed,wowthats the most naive view of space exploration ive encountered in a long time the european space agency and jaxa have both launched venus missions so its clearly not a lack of scientific merit
space,not_removed,thats total scifi at the moment the conditions are great but the logistics of a longterm floating city are ridiculous
space,not_removed,sulphuric acid is a nonproblem for anything but your skin and even then only at high concentrations unless youre trying to fly around with some unalloyed metal youre pretty much safe
space,not_removed,heh it took me a minute to realize that the pushback i was getting was actually of the provenus type i had to read it a few more times just to make sure i had something similar around reading about how many missions there used to be to venus along with their travel time which was just a few months after that i read about how breathable air is a floating gas there the atmosphere at km above the surface we can fly a plane there all day every day for as long as it lasts and then i began to get more and more dumbfounded that nobody wants to spend the money on a cheap mission to the closest destination after the moon at least to check if there is microbial life in the clouds how can nobody want to check there for life while were at it also just how crazy easy surface landings are with the venera landers just using that kind of screwdriverlike thing to spin around and lower the velocity without even using a parachute meanwhile mars landers of any real size need a whole sky crane to manage it the other interesting discovery i made at the time was about maxwell montes and a lot of other parts of venus at around km above sea level have an atmospheric pressure just half of that of the surface and a little bit cooler too i strongly believe we and refer to their conditions in ranges because thats keeping us from seeing the range of conditions on the surface that goes for every terrestrial planet but venus in particular gets shafted here with its bars of pressure that isnt true all over the areas a surface craft could explore then for a while i wrote comments like yours on the spacecom forums until i got so tired arguing with the mars first mars only crowd that i just stopped for the most part and i think my previous comment making it look like the engineering would be harder than it is might have been an unconscious way to avoid the inevitable fight with those that get offended by the idea that a location other than mars could be worth spending money on by the way if you want to be a mod at rvenus let me know and ill add you really small of course so not much work at all
space,not_removed,regarding trees as bio printers theres only so much we can control of that process though ive heard of the hydro cell car and all and know in the abstract that we can synthesize chemicals and compounds via chemical reaction chains but were talking condensation like water vapor distillation but for other source material which may require further separationconversion to a usable format right lets say you need carbon but its all bound in compounds in the atmosphere wed need to figure the most efficient way to capture weve convert that carbon to raw material that we can use later for hydrocarbon plastics or what have you for human habitation also would subterranean habitation work better in terms of insulation against the elements id think that new colonizing efforts human or robotic science expeditionary would need to bide time until resources were able to get used on less immediately pressing things to allow for aboveground expansion this does make the wild assumption that the geography and geology allows for stable long term stable shelter to get created but i technically am just a futon scificouldberealifdoneright science nerd i have to recant even having an arm chair c
space,not_removed,the soviets did it years ago and on a shoestring budget yeah for about minutes you severely underestimate the conditions on venus theyre almost unimaginable theres simply no good way to send anything to venus and have it last any meaningful length of time
space,not_removed,wrong esa and jaxa have both launched a venus mission one each singular nasa has already visited venus with a variety of spacecraft radar mapping with pioneer atmospheric probes with pioneer further radar with magellan plus more than a half dozen other flybys a venus mission lost out to the selection of stardust yet another lost out to contour genesis and messenger the combination of budget constraints the priorities of the deadal survey and the engineering maturity of the missions proposed simply places other targets within the field of planetary science at a higher priority venus has scientific merit but the process of peer review has established that other targets have more compelling science to be done you dont have to like the reality of the situation but you cant ignore it just because what you want and what the process of peer review concludes differ doesnt mean that youre magically right venus has been represented in every round of competed discovery missions if there was suitably compelling science to be done it would have won one already i say again nasa has not snubbed venus snubbing isnt of second round discovery round selections we live in a budget constrained environment given double triple the planetary science budget there would be venus mission aplenty an adequately compelling case for venus science is yet to be made perhaps disco will be a venus mission note im not saying venus isnt interesting but the reality is that the science has not been argued as interesting enough if it were otherwise we would have more venus missions we do not that presents an inescapable truth however much you disagree with it
space,not_removed,hell yeah i want to mod i love quixotic endeavors but in all seriousness the only other sub i mod is rbadphilosophy and thats because they went through a purge of banning pretty much everybody who wasnt a mod its kind of an alice in wonderland kind of sub
space,not_removed,made my first post as mod crickets haha i looked up the highest point of venus because of what you wrote about sea level and found out that maxwell montes is a mountain range not a person ha how do we get an ad on the fp maybe we should start an rtrollmars sub
space,not_removed,ive heard of the hydro cell car and all and know in the abstract that we can synthesize chemicals and compounds via chemical reaction chains not abstract actual weve been doing it for at least the past century httpsenwikipediaorgwikihaberprocess but carbon fixation hasnt been necessary until very recently because carbon sources are so abundant in other forms esp coal oil and wood generally anything nature can do we can do better as long as its only one thing the more complex the system the more likely nature is to do it better than us carbon fixation is not terribly complicated it just takes energy input and since were used to extracting energy by burning carbon its kind of counter intuitive in the long run carbon will be an energy storage method produce hydrocarbons to burn later not an energy source but back to venus the energy sources are numerous the sun which gives a much nicer return in the upper venusian atmosphere than it does on earths surface a little nuclear reactor the venusian wind or the temperature and pressure differential between differing altitudes like some more sophisticated version of a sterling engine nitrogen water sulfuric acid energy any compound you can make with those which includes burnable fuel and oxygen breathable air most plastics carbon fiber many adhesives things you cant make are glass silicon electronics silicon various metals metal objects and some adhesives some of which are made using more obscure elements but electronics can be imported glass windows is largely unnecessary except for camera lenses see electronics metals are cheaper but not strictly necessary for much at all adhesives i honestly dont know well enough to be able to say one way or another
space,not_removed,no i estimate them accurately high temperature electronics like the stuff they use for oil drilling geothermal and various other industrial scenarios are available off the shelf up to about which is within the range of venusian surface temperatures ergo landing it in a place thats cooler than the mean implies being able to last indefinitely without cooling or temperature shielding though it might still need some pressure shielding whats more the little balloons last for days and only quit because their batteries gave out our battery tech is better our solar panel tech is better our materials choices are better finally
space,not_removed,wrong esa and jaxa have both launched a venus mission one each singular thats to put it mildly an uncharitable reading of what i wrote and one that completely ignores my point that your initial point about peer review is pure unadultered bullshit nasa is and has always been a political organization beholden to a congress that doesnt generally care about its mission it was started because the soviets had a space program and we had to be better than the soviets at everything when we beat them ie when it because clear that the soviets werent going to make it to the moon congress cut nasas funding so as you say i dont have to like the reality of the situation but youre completely out of touch with reality if you think that peer review and scientific merit are the only driving forces behind mission selection no space agency has ever worked that way and no space agency is likely to in the foreseeable future as such it is completely true that nasa hasnt launched a venus mission in years jaxas budget is nasas and nasa spends about what jaxa does on planetary exploration the lions share has gone to mars and the other stuff has gone everywhere but venus finally the big problem with the budgetary constraints theory is that venus is cheap cheaper than anywhere but the moon the soviet vega missions cost about million each in which is about million in they did a halleys comet rendezvous a lander and a balloon venus express cost million euros the europa flyby by contrast is expected to cost between and billion dollars so nasas not avoiding venus because of cost it cost next to nothing in nasa terms to do venus missions ceres europa and pluto are all ridiculously far away and therefore exponentially more expensive for the same mission
space,not_removed,on the plus side itll stay on the top of the subreddit for like a week rvenus should be able to reach a few thousand people i think maxwell montes is the only part of venus with a nonfemale name by the way take a look at the comments in this post of mine from a long time ago geoffrey a landis wrote two comments specifically about the heat and pressure at higher altitudes
space,not_removed,sorry to specify im aware on an abstract level but not like a oh right those level like i am with battery electric because its all over the news but basically it sounds like the best way to proceed is to use the ocean as various testing grounds for turbulencepressure engines and try to refine atmosphericsourced synthesis with added sulfuric acid gas later to try those possibilities as our next step getting the technologies we would need tested and approved for earth levels of hell and moving on from there
space,not_removed,firstly anything that goes to venus will necessarily require not only the ability to operate through psi of pressure at minimum as well as the insane heat but it would also need to be able to deal with hydrogen sulfide and sulfuric atmosphere which is account for roughly of the venusian atmosphere secondly anything capable of surviving the pressure the heat and the atmosphere will necessarily need to be heavy theres no way around it thirdly have you tried suspending a full compliment of planetary exploration and research equipment from balloons how do you propose those balloons get inflated when they get to venus you have half answers and ill state it plainly you have no clue what youre actually talking about now be a big boy and do some reading please before you make stupid statements
space,not_removed,im afraid you simply dont understand the mechanisms of the discovery program by which such a mission would be selected
space,not_removed,i wonder how much if at all the state of high temp electronics has changed since then also for my money i think id rather send a million tiny zeppelins to map the flow and composition at various places and altitudes in the atmosphere it might be that changing altitude and flying across the wind to a current going a different direction might allow landis little airplane to not have to work as hard edit also i now want geoffrey landis to do an ama
space,not_removed,psi hahahahahaha do you know what psi is about bar you can dive that deep in a normal wet suit now bar on the other hand the average pressure at the surface of venus is a big deal more like of depth but youre wrong about that the minimum is actually bar on the venusian equivalent of mt everest equivalent in that its the highest point but its not small in the same way the peak of everest is the temperature there is a brisk c now before you tell me in all your vast understanding of the current limits of technology how this is impossible let me remind you that the oil drilling industry employs electronics in downhole drilling that operate in highly corrosive conditions up to kpsi or bar and well above c anything capable of surviving the pressure the heat and the atmosphere will necessarily need to be heavy heavy nice technical term there for reference venera was the curiousity rover is not including the skycrane which is not required for venus due to its thick atmosphere since getting to venus is about half the distance of mars its cheaper per kilogram as well have you tried suspending a full compliment of planetary exploration and research equipment from balloons how do you propose those balloons get inflated when they get to venus your ignorance of all things science is baffling to me do you even know what a weather balloon is as in do you know what theyre used for ill give you a hint suspending a full complement of equipment for planetary research as for how its going to inflate again are you intentionally obtuse or just that ignorant theres about and one ways to create gas from not gas or to expand gas thats compressed if the soviets managed it in the im going to go out on a limb and say we might be able to replicate it maybe even improve on it you have no clue what youre actually talking about coming from the guy who thinks psi is a lot that heavy is the reason we cant send stuff to venus and that inflating balloons is the biggest engineering hurdle to venusian atmospheric research ill take that as a compliment
space,not_removed,youre the first person ive ever encountered who is this starry eyed about nasa the pope various political figures charles manson sure but nasa you think a bureaucracy is motivated by pure science i feel like im telling you that santa isnt real except im hoping youre older than ten although i guess i hope even more that youre not and still have no idea how babies are made
space,not_removed,okay ace you think you got all the answers you tell nasa which is comprised of some of the most intelligent and talented engineers on earth that its totally reasonable and easy to send a probe to venus good luck
space,not_removed,you dont have to take his word for it projects are selected via a competitive peerreview process same as pretty much all federallyfunded research scientists are evaluating the proposals go to wikipedia and read the selection process section of the discovery program page or read the wikipedia page on the peerreview process more generally it would appear that a strongenough venus mission simply hasnt been proposed if youd like you could submit a proposal the info is on the discovery website
space,not_removed,not sure i could pick which flight id rather have been on between this and but id give anything to have seen these in person
space,not_removed,its moments like this that make me think about how far humans have come from living in caves to traveling in the air as you record others traveling to space
space,not_removed,imagine if the wright brothers got to come back to life for one day to ride on that plane and witness a space shuttle leaving the planetthey would flip shit
space,not_removed,astronomer here worth mentioning that if you ever fly to florida from elsewhere in the usa orlando and points south try and grab a window seat on the plane thats facing the atlantic side the httpsenwikipediaorgwikivehicleassemblybuilding at cape canaveral is one of the largest buildings in the world by volume and its amazing how easy it is to spot from pretty much any flight heading that way as long as its clear if you really want to push your luck btw check out httpswwwkennedyspacecentercomeventsaspx for rocket launches from cape canaveral filter for rocket launches only they still do regular ones the only trick though is launches are often scrubbed for the tiniest of things so i wouldnt exactly plan an entire vacation around a specific time to see one
space,not_removed,im assuming this isnt the space shuttle since the last launch was but its an impressive video none the less
space,not_removed,this footage always amazes me everytime i watch it it really makes me think about how trivial and pointless wars are and that we should be going upwards and outwards as a species together instead of backwards
space,not_removed,how is this possible the world is flat everyone knows that i cant believe people actually think the world is flat
space,not_removed,just imagine that that year ago try telling someone that one day humans will be flying on a steel bird feet in the air filming a rocket heading to space with a small device that can tell you anything you ever wanted to know and talk with anyone you ever wanted to do wow
space,not_removed,wed be able to get to space so much faster if we could only learn how to launch rockets straight up but they always seem to go slantwise some day
space,not_removed,it looks a lot less chaotic in real life than it does in the movies

space,not_removed,hmmm never seen a vertical chemtrail dispersion unit before the government must be testing new models
space,not_removed,years ago i probably would have picked the solar eclipse since in the states it would be fairly rare but growing up with the shuttle program id give anything to watch that thing ascend one last time in person
space,not_removed,id bet good money this was filmed from a nasagovernment plane theres no way that airspace wasnt closed off for the launch that thing explodes or decides to go off in a random direction that plane could be toast
space,not_removed,so far relative short time compared to human history
space,not_removed,i watched a man made vehicle leave earths atmosphere from a small screen in my hand while sipping coffee in a small guatemalan village using their wifi and now im sharing that fact with anyone else in the world who cares enough to read it
space,not_removed,some times i think about the same thingthen i think about our hubrisand how the furthest in the cosmos we have gotten is two men for an entire year in space or the quarter million miles or so to the moon i mean were practically still on the doorstep but it is pretty cool and i like to be a glass half full kind of guy so i think all the progress we have made and it is amazing
space,not_removed,orville wright died in which was years after the first man made vehicle went into space
space,not_removed,good advice but id suggest using httpsspaceflightnowcomlaunchschedule instead of kscs website ksc only lists nasa launches which make up a minority of the launches from cape canaveral
space,not_removed,the roof of the vab is higher than any natural elevation in the entire state of florida the vab is literally taller than florida
space,not_removed,how do you think they got it from florida to the smithsonian s for clarification
space,not_removed,your timing is correct but the video linked is a shortened version of which explains that the video was recorded july it was the last shuttle launch
space,not_removed,the title says it was a space shuttle launch unless theyre back and i missed something
space,not_removed,what no this video is actually from four years ago heres the original upload jeezdont the moderatorscommentators here realize when youre being spammed
space,not_removed,well yeah you could get up there faster but youd fall right back thats basically what the early mercury missions did the hard part of getting to space is staying there for orbits it is largely horizontal speed you need so that youre traveling fast enough for the curved earth to fall away from you as fast as you fall back towards it
space,not_removed,it looks calm from so far away but the ride up is pretty wild
space,not_removed,the solid rocket boosters burnt out and were jettisoned liquid fuel rockets dont typically make thick smoky exhaust like that solid rocket boosters are made from a heavy rubberlike substance with powdered aluminium and ammonium perchlorate mixed in and the exhaust is full of caustic byproducts as well as huge chunks of aluminium oxide
space,not_removed,during the first phase of flight the shuttle used its main engines the three big ones sticking out the rear of the shuttle itself as well as the side mounted solid rocket boosters srbs to power ascent the solid rocket boosters are jettisoned a short time after launch as theyve done their job and you dont want to continue carrying that weight and what youre seeing is that those rockets are no longer burning after theyve been jettisoned hence no visible exhaust trail anymore the shuttle continues to use its main engines after that to attain orbit but they burn oxygen and hydrogen ie the exhaust is just water and dont leave as much of an exhaust trail as the srbs
space,not_removed,i was unaware of this fact good to know thanks
space,not_removed,engineers dont get excited about science
space,not_removed,hahai like you you know whats up
space,not_removed,theyre definitely not back
space,not_removed,mercury is a much smaller planet though so its probably easier to keep pointed straight up the engineering to keep a rocket straight just isnt there yet
space,not_removed,i had an old nasa geezer tell me that the decision to use srbs was primarily pr driven having an big smoky exhaust plume is what the public expects even though its not the best design decision i never looked into it further to see whether he was just a conspiracy nut but it was an interesting story
space,not_removed,engineers dont get excited when a difficult task is completed they feel a very brief sense of satisfaction at their work and then move on to the next task edit s
space,not_removed,thats true although without an atmosphere its astonishing how well their rocket fins worked back then and how much difficulty we have now s
space,not_removed,pretty bold generalization there i know plenty of normal enthusiastic engineers sure there are many different ways to react to an accomplishment but to sit back and pretend that engineers are all task robots is just silly to me edit s accepted

space,not_removed,my grandfather was the command module pilot for apollo the photos from this mission are just beautiful i wanted to do an ama with him for the anniversary unfortunately it didnt work out edit riama at eastern on august it worked out
space,not_removed,i cant begin to imagine how it must have felt like being in this vehicle seeing with your own eyes these things having the whole planet listening or watching the events unfold being the first to be on another world these kinds of images are the definition of an image worth a thousand words
space,not_removed,i dont think i can point out anything specific but that mountain is so beautiful to me the pitch black background maybe
space,not_removed,the first manned landing to have the lrv lunar roving vehicle aboard
space,not_removed,right now in the next hour theres probably things i could easily screw up that would mean none of us could return to earth alive
space,not_removed,isnt that mountain in the background actually ginormous and it looks somewhat small due to the lack of perspective
space,not_removed,aka the one mission no one gave a shit about it wasnt even on tv its crazy how blase we became two years after the world watched man walk on the moon men walking on the moon became so mundane they wouldnt even broadcast them its mindboggling im pretty sure they didnt realise it would be about the last time
space,not_removed,i remember i was excited but just thought it was the first step to a moonbase
space,not_removed,this is so cool to see an image from a mass that isnt earth where other humans have actually stepped foot on gives me goosebumps
space,not_removed,fyi the hill in the foreground is httpsenwikipediaorgwikimonshadley the lack of atmosphere makes its contrast very sharp against the blackness of space and your brain interprets this as being closer than it actually is

space,not_removed,maybe nintendo can put some pokemon up there that might finally garner enough interest to go back
space,not_removed,i could definitely see how stupid people think these are faked it looks so surreal
space,not_removed,i hate how some people can look at a picture like this the result of millions of hours of work by thousands of hugely intelligent men and women getting human beings off this rock and taking their first steps into space and their first thoughts will be nah thats a fake
space,not_removed,ive seen all your posts they are fascinating i didnt know he was your grandfather until now i hope he does an ama id love it
space,not_removed,any pictures of the apollo landing sites id love to see one taken with an earth or spacebased telescope or maybe they put a camera on one of the gazillion probes sent up there

space,not_removed,years ago those astronauts must be so ashamed in the government and how little its done in space
space,not_removed,can anyone with the proper knowledge explain why the background behind that mon doesnt show any stars
space,not_removed,i just realized what was so weird about seeing pictures from the moon theres no moon like night pictures on earth you always see the moon in it or some sort of back light from the moon but when you look at pictures from the moons surface its just so barren and desolate theres nothing in the sky but black space no moon no ambient light from the atmosphere just ground and space
space,not_removed,genuine question why is it that stars arent littering the backdrop in pictures from the moon theres virtually zero light pollution except the sun is it sunlight reflecting that blocks it out crappy cameras
space,not_removed,no disrespect to the people in our space program but it sucks beyon all words and its kind of shameful that its been years since we accomplished this and havent already walked on mars all disrespect to the shortsighted politicians who kept us from it
space,not_removed,this is amazing almost tricked me because the sunlight is in such a weird position thought the hill was a reflection
space,not_removed,how did they know in advance that the moon surface not had a thick layer of light dust that they would sink down in
space,not_removed,that mountain there is httpsenwikipediaorgwikimonshadley tall or about five times as high as the grand canyon is deep the lack of objects for scale trees cacti etc and the closeness of the horizon make it really hard to gauge how big things are on the moon
space,not_removed,can what was left behind still be spotted from here on earth given a powerful enough telescope
space,not_removed,some of the images from the later apollo missions are absolutely breathtaking and the best from all the missionsand yet they are not as well known and recognised its a shame i think the moon exhibit was my favourite part of the smithsonian air and space museum when i visited a few months ago an aweinspiring reminder of what i consider to be americas greatest achievement by far thats my cents
space,not_removed,imagine going to the moon but something got fucked up on landing and now you cant take back off now your stuck on the moon what are some things you would do before you run out of supplies and eventually die
space,not_removed,photographs like this are enormously inspirational they seem surreal yet theyre completely real
space,not_removed,imo apollo had the most interesting landing site and the most spectacular photos
space,not_removed,i dont know why but that mountain is unsettling to me like if i was there id keep my eye on that mountain for the duration of the trip just in case it was plotting something
space,not_removed,to be honest this is scary just a big floating rock within all the darkness
space,not_removed,wowhas a whole different perspective in colour would have been pretty eerie i imagine
space,not_removed,so there are moon quakes what do we know about lunar orogenic processes
space,not_removed,or so they want us to believe the truth is out there dont really believe this just wanted to stir things up a bit
space,not_removed,stop scrolling the comments down there vvvvvv only get more and more shit as you go please keep your tinfoil hats at the ready
space,not_removed,dumb question maybe not but why in all the apollo missions and early space missions do photographs have the large plus signs on them does it act as a grid for astronauts to level their pictures or something
space,not_removed,i kind of feel like this is what loneliness looks like if you were to put it in picture form its a kind of beautiful isolationbut ultimately pretty empty
space,not_removed,how come they dont get infused with sun radiation or something due to the lack of a proper atmosphere
space,not_removed,and with new leadership on the right we can can to the moon and stay and go to mars and not to the middle eastwaste money on aid to the world
space,not_removed,even though it was that long ago the quality was absolutely amazing httpiimgurcomoaloxiljpg
space,not_removed,youre not a real scientist if you wouldnt get out go to the top of that mountain and say im the king of the moon thats just science
space,not_removed,on apollo they explored the ruins of an ancient dreadnought and recovered a human mummy
space,not_removed,ha landed on the moon thats a good one jk tho we went to the moon
space,not_removed,i think the reason people think its fake is because it i absolutely unbelievable even i still find it hard to believe it actually happened sometimes but i know it actually did i think it just falls under the category of you have to see it to believe it but this is a beautiful photo nonetheless
space,not_removed,its a pity they could not make picture from a bit elevated perspective like eg a bit up a hill that would have looked amazing
space,not_removed,i was going to comment but everyone here has pretty much said everything i am thinking and i cant wait for this ama 👍
space,not_removed,legitimate question are there photos made by other countriesgovernments showing telescope views of this mission in progress
space,not_removed,is it really maybe a screenshot from elite dangeroushorizons who knows
space,not_removed,to bad it never really happened would be impressive if it did though
space,not_removed,i just wonder why there isnt a single star in this picture especially as the background is pitch black
space,not_removed,ahem vs untouched photos and perpendicular shadows in a pan yay totally not reasonable doubt s
space,not_removed,woah computer generated graphics these days are getting out of hand still waiting for us to actually go to the moon or satellite
space,not_removed,they also did this with apollo through the top hatch but was never publicly voiced or noted till one idiot at nasa published rolls of film onto the websight showing they infact did uva aka door open to space and standing up to view out of the top hatch reason for this is at a the higher elevation of the lem it could and did help confirm they landed in the correct spot dont know why im getting down voted bit did do an unannounced eva through the top hatch that was not publicly confirmed till the late google it plebs
space,not_removed,just odd all details of the landing module shadows etc but no stars
space,not_removed,notice how the shadows are a bit contorted there appears to be multiple light sources and the mountain in the background has more of an earthen geographical form most likely because this was filmed somewhere in the greater arizona mesa region
space,not_removed,this post has made it to up votes and has been posted on the twitter account to see the tweet check here you can find all posts here posts here and posts here im a bot dont worry about supporting me i dont cost much but you can support httpfreethoughtpediacomwikisecularcharities and httpwwwsensorg
space,not_removed,look you can almost see the key grip and the best boy in the reflection in the window
space,not_removed,arent there supposed to be billions of stars in the background the moon has no atmosphere right so it doesnt block the view
space,not_removed,these days they make realistic scenary like that with cgi but back in early they had to use painted backdrops amazing
space,not_removed,thats clearly a hollywood set nothing to see here enjoy your chemtrails sheeple
space,not_removed,whats amazing is that years ago they had the technology to produce hd quality images and yet it was not available to the masses
space,not_removed,absolutely amazing you can clearly see where the black sand on the hangar floor ends and the backdrop painting begins
space,not_removed,holy shit your grandfather is al worden would it be possible to do an ama any other time i dont feel like we need the excuse of an anniversary to want to talk to somebody that has been to the moon even if he didnt walk on it
space,not_removed,wow no pressure in your family while growing up i bet your grandfather flew to the moon you can at least get a summer job your grandfather flew to the moon i think you can manage taking out the garbage your grandfather flew to the moon tell me again how hard your day was at school no but seriously props to your grandfather
space,not_removed,ask him how was stanley kubrik in person s no seriously your grandfather is one of a kind it would be amazing to hear the stories from one of the few people in this world who have been on the moon kudos
space,not_removed,i met al a few weeks ago in san diego your grandfather is amazing please let him know our conversation was the highlight of my decade d
space,not_removed,wow read your grandads book last year it was a cracking read must be cool to have a grandfather that is one of the very few of us earthlings to have left earth orbit you had to be a cut above to be a cmp too i read that deke slayton only chose the very best for the position as they would be the only means of rescue should the lander get in trouble much respect to all the apollo guys its a part of human history that has always fascinated me since i was a kid
space,not_removed,i met your grandfather a couple years ago and he autographed my pilot logbook next to a couple other apollo astronauts hell of a nice guy you come from good stock
space,not_removed,col wordens was a remarkable memoir ive read nearly every one written by the apollo astronauts including those of schirra borman stafford young aldrin collins bean shepard mitchell irwin duke scott cernan and schmitt and his is one of the standouts for his candor
space,not_removed,gosh darn it this is why i love reddit
space,not_removed,dont mind me just recognize me thats as close as i can get to the moon
space,not_removed,never thought the grandson of the command module pilot of one of the apollo missions would call himself sackofpens
space,not_removed,this never happened something something flat earth
space,not_removed,checked my front page and saw you actually followed through with this good job
space,not_removed,thats amazing man to have someone in the family that walked on another world for me thats a great acomplishment now on the funny question topic did he see anything like aliens have a nice day and best of thoughts to your grandfather
space,not_removed,is he friends with buzz aldrin
space,not_removed,your grandfather must be awesome as hell
space,not_removed,surprised no one has made a joke about the fact his grandfather is literally a command module
space,not_removed,thats incredible my uncle built a lot of the moon rover but your grandfather piloted the thing there wow
space,not_removed,can you call and ask him if the earth is flat or round please
space,not_removed,apollo episode of from the earth to the moon is one of my favorites have you seen it
space,not_removed,is your grand father a free mason by any chance
space,not_removed,thats awesome my grandfather worked on the lunar lander at grumman due to his time at grumman he has parkibsons though the project manager for the lunar lander project is here on long island also he does taxes for aarp during tax season
space,not_removed,i get butterflies in my stomach just trying to image what itd be like to open the hatch onto that i sometimes think that these astronauts must just be military robots they excel in literally everything they do and any normal human would pop with excitement or just be completely overwhelmed and unable to function
space,not_removed,this was actually the fourth manned landing on the moon after apollo and but still a very cool picture
space,not_removed,last summer i worked two jobs sometimes three or four weeks at a time with no day off so i could save money for a trip to russia everyday when i woke up and started to slowly realize that i was in russia i would start to get so excited and practically jump out of bed to start my day could you imagine waking up on the moon
space,not_removed,this was apollo by then nobody was watching or listening which is why the apollo missions were cut shortly after due to low ratings
space,not_removed,the unfortunate reality is that by apollo the majority of the planet had tuned out the moon missions other than tv news highlights and some newspaper articles in jim lovells book apollo the crew does a press conference on the way to the moon pre kaboom and the controllers dont have the heart to tell them that none of the networks were carrying it live shows how quickly we get bored and move onto something new even back then
space,not_removed,wow i thought that was a reflection on the glass until i read your comment
space,not_removed,oh shit thats a mountain damn no atmosphere really fucks with the diffuse lighting that is one dimly lit mountain
space,not_removed,just so gentle the lighting the backdrop no harsh features you knows its in absolute isolation and has never touched its like seeing that perfect hill after a snowstorm before the first footprints so perfect
space,not_removed,thats no mountain its a space station
space,not_removed,i think its more the fact that its on the freaking moon
space,not_removed,the apollo landing site was located at ° north latitude by ° east longitude at the foot of the apennine mountain range the apennines rise up to more than feet m along the southeastern edge of mare imbrium sea of rains the apennine escarpment—highest on the moon—is higher above the flatlands than the east face of the sierra nevadas in california and the himalayan front rising above the plains of india and nepal the landing site had been selected to allow the astronauts to drive from the lm to the apennine front during two of the evas i still cant tell if thats a foothill or a mountain
space,not_removed,yes that mountain his huge but the lack of perspective makes it seem nearer to the viewer and therefor also smaller the mountain is actually miles away from the lander
space,not_removed,wow i didnt know they had instagram in the on the moon
space,not_removed,why does the photo on that site have a red tint to it
space,not_removed,this makes me sad people would rather watch cartoons and movies than watching people go to the moon being a young guy i would kill to watch it live like my parents did
space,not_removed,i get upset when i think about this humans can be so disappointing if people had informed themselves about what really went into making those missions possible and the ridiculous risks involved they would have been interested i like to think more people would be interested if the apollo missions were happening now because it would be much easier to access plentiful and detailed information about it thanks to the internet i could be wrong of course
space,not_removed,nice i want to make that my wallpaper or something
space,not_removed,you put a gym on the moon and i guarantee you in weeks some guy is gonna find a way to get up there and claim it
space,not_removed,people also forget that the technology to adequately fake the visual images simply didnt exist back then either
space,not_removed,if they faked it then they faked it six times once faked i might believe that but not six times
space,not_removed,only a born loser will think its fake probably the same idiots who think aliens built the pyramids
space,not_removed,google it lunar recon orbiter took some that mapped the landing sites a few years back but even with that the resolution is still not great still you can make out the abandoned equipment
space,not_removed,seeing something as tiny as the apollo equipment on the moon from earth is entirely a problem of the telescopes resolving power and that is entirely dependent on mirror size or for a refracting telescope front objective lens size the forthcoming eelt telescope which has a mirror may just barely have the resolving power to pick out dark spots at the landing sites without seeing them as more than singlepixel specks its resolution at the distance of the moon given perfect conditions would be about per pixel no space telescope has a mirror large enough to do so realistically to view the sites you should look up what john mentioned from the lunar recon orbiter until another satellite orbits the moon with even better cameras thats about as good as it will get
space,not_removed,well space exploration is starting to pick up again or at least testing of future rocket systems is some pretty exciting stuff happening at the moment tbh
space,not_removed,ok they had the best perspective what did that result in were they able to immediately target interesting geological features and if so why was the technique abandoned on apollo and
space,not_removed,that man colonel david scott commander apollo i believe that nasa thought the standup eva to be too risky but dave scott wonders the same thing at has additional discussion
space,not_removed,he has parkinsons due to all the chemicals he dealt with is that common was he in an accident or somethings i know hypergolic fuels can be nasty but i never heard of anyone from the apollo program suffering from exposure effects
space,not_removed,hey guys i kinda want to be the first guy to piss on the moon you just know someone said that at some point
space,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikireticle
space,not_removed,how far away do you think it is
space,not_removed,exposure the camera is stopped down to low exposure to keep the whole image from blowing out the sideeffect of that is the stars are underexposed
space,not_removed,the surface of the moon in sunlight is really bright stars are not the camera aperture and shutter speed are to blame these settings determine how much and how long the film is exposed to light if you were to open the shutter long enough to capture the stars the bright lunar surface would just over expose the film and wash it all out youd just get a mostly white photo essentially your eyes kind of have the same issue if youre in a bright room and walk outside and look at the night sky you wont really see shit until your pupils dialate then when you walk back inside light tends to be somewhat blinding until your pupils contract
space,not_removed,because the stars are incredibly dim they are not going to show on an exposure in bright sunlight from what i hear the astronauts couldnt even make the stars out with their own eyes it was that bright
space,not_removed,the stars are there and the light they have produced are there too its just the light is so weak compared to the light of the sun wecameras cant see them have you ever been texting or using your phone on a bright day and can barely see the screen because of the sunlight reflecting off same concept the phone is of course giving off light but the sunlight is so much brighter because of how our eyes work that the screen appears so much darker than it actually is our eyes adjust to the brightest light even if were focusing on something dimmer and cameras work in exactly the same way in order to get a sharp and clear photo of the moon they have to adjust to the moons brightness not the stars this means that very much like the phone screen the stars appear dimmer than they would be but because the moon is so bright in relation to the stars the stars appear none existent now its possible to take pictures of the stars on the moon but had the cameras been adjusted to focus on the dim light of the stars which would almost certainly require a very very low shutter speed the amount of time the camera is letting light in that would mean anything else in shot would be very very bright and very very blurred not so great for taking pictures of the moon
space,not_removed,if there was a moon up in the sky behind that mountain that would require some explaining umm houston i think we are in canada
space,not_removed,theres also no atmospheric haze which we unconsciously use as a measure of distance between that and the lack of yardstick objects like vegetation it makes it really hard to judge distances and contributes to the overall sense of weirdness
space,not_removed,because its daytime there its hard to tell because theres no atmosphere to scatter the light but the fact that you can see the ground means its illuminated by the sun and thus way brighter than the background stars i mean really the daytime surface of the moon is so bright we can see it from here during
space,not_removed,yeah basically if they set the exposure long enough to capture stars the sunlight would have made the surface features just look solid white either that or they were smart enough to pull off this major fake that fooled the world for years but they were stupid enough to forget the stars smart money is on the first one
space,not_removed,genuine answer google it its a somewhat long answer which has been given out thousands and thousands of times basic photography the tldr is exposure
space,not_removed,httpjoshworthcomdevpixelspacepixelspacesolarsystemhtml look how far apart earth and moon are now look how far apart earth and mars are lets not forget that the moon is always here but mars isnt because it revolves around the sun not earth now you know
space,not_removed,amen brother one of the things i dislike about richard nixon he helped kill apollo and got the shuttle program on wheels dont get me wrong the shuttle was a beloved part of my childhood and an amazing piece of tech but it never lived up to its original specs a spacegoing pickup truck with a short turn around time we spent years going in the wrong direction now were back to rocketsand making progress but wed be so much further along if wed sent just one apollo mission to the moon every couple of years i also get angry when i think about them turning the last two saturn vs into monuments now theyre test firing old engines from it to get data on building new ones and cutting open apollo heat shields on mothballed exhibits at the smithsonian to redevelop that tech at least theres a chance we might make it to mars or get a lunar base in my lifetime im just disappointed in what developed in this area ok off the soapbox here endeth the lesson for the day
space,not_removed,we had landed probes on the moon before hand
space,not_removed,we had also already landed people on the moon before this mission
space,not_removed,they already landed probes like surveyor on the moon before the first manned mission so they knew what to expect so that the astronauts could inspect the probe and take some parts back to earth to study the effect of leaving stuff on the moon for an extended period of time
space,not_removed,we didnt know for sure it was a big concern for nasa when designing the landers they were very afraid that it might sink into the dust or tip over when touching down because they had no idea how thick or how soft it was its why the lander had long legs and very large pads at the end of each one they tested the design in numerous types of dusts in simulations to make sure it would be able to land safely
space,not_removed,they didnt ther were reasonably certain that it wouldnt via the probes that had landed before apollo as a back up they placed timed pauses in the mission to check for adverse affects the first was a one minute pause right after the landing if the lander had started sinking during that minute the would have slapped the abort button and gotten out of there it went on out to minutes after that then i believe normal operations commenced at that point
space,not_removed,there was a fellow that tried to convince them that there was danger there httpsenwikipediaorgwikithomasgold though its a more complicated story than that
space,not_removed,no not even close but the httpswwwnasagovmissionpagesapollorevisited provides the best images of the apollo landing sites
space,not_removed,no but nasas lunar reconnaissance orbiter has photographed all the landing sites
space,not_removed,i dont know if you can fap in a space suit but id damn well try
space,not_removed,dude first guy to piss on the moon you cant really top that
space,not_removed,hadley rille i always said if i had a production company id name it after an apollo landing site hadley rille taurus littrow descartes highlands
space,not_removed,there are literally countless big floating rocks in the darkness this one actually serves as our protector
space,not_removed,there are thousands of color pictures taken from the moon you just have to look for them hell theres even color video of them driving on the moon on youtube
space,not_removed,astronauts do get exposed to solar radiation but its low enough that their gear is able to protect from most of it during the short exposure period figuring out how to deal with prolonged exposure is one of the challenges faced for any sort of permanent structurepopulation
space,not_removed,why do people hate moon conspiracies so much am i the only one that thinks they are hilarious its like the flat earthers totally redclious
space,not_removed,no its not possible to resolve that level of detail from earth
space,not_removed,if youre going to troll at least be a little more original about it
space,not_removed,have you done your own research and i dont mean google you can test the reflectors on the moon yourself many have done it before you
space,not_removed,if the exposure was set for the stars the moon and spacecraft would be white as it was set for the moon and spacecraft the stars are not visible because theyre too dim for the exposure
space,not_removed,because the film probably didnt access all the channels of light for fear of overexposure they are taking it through filtered glass hence the reflection of the arm that tries to filter a lot of light the moon is pretty white in sunlight not smoky gray just imagine intense light pollution with no dispersion in an atmosphere like taking pictures in daytime through smoky glass
space,not_removed,you are possibly the most gullible person ive bumped into on reddit this year have you not even bothered to look into these anomalies ill bet you got taken in by if we evolved from monkeys why are there still monkeys as well
space,not_removed,you dont know anything about photography
space,not_removed,but if we actually did you still wouldnt believe it
space,not_removed,it was day time do you see stars in the day
space,not_removed,see elsewhere the camera was set at low exposure to prevent the sunlight and earthlight from washing everything out if you put an observatory on the far side of the moon youd have unbelievable visibility
space,not_removed,its funny how photos of the moon are by far and away the fastest way to see if someone is completely ignorant of all things related to photography
space,not_removed,correct the moon has no atmosphere so imagine how bright that sun is have you ever heard of light pollution when trying to photograph stars and such
space,not_removed,thats an extremely filtered glass and probably a special film to limit the channels of light it accepts so that the astronauts dont roast and the film doesnt immediately get overexposed the moon is blazing white in the presence of the sun you also are dealing with the worst possible light pollution the sun
space,not_removed,some stars bright with uvx raysgamma light and space have too clouds of dirty and gasses because that you need to take a picture with a big exposure time to take enough light from the deep universe
space,not_removed,distant stars appear dim compared to something nearby illuminated by the sun if they exposed for the stars the lunar surface would be completely white
space,not_removed,its day time do you want stars in the day
space,not_removed,you dont see stars during the day on the moon for the same reason you dont see them during the day on the earth the sun is too bright
space,not_removed,russia conceded that the us beat them in the space race to the moon so why cant you
space,not_removed,concrete moon dust and its geoengineering get it right
space,not_removed,have you ever even used a camera that wasnt also a cellphone
space,not_removed,the moon landings were real dude we landed on the moon six times if you are going to fake something you do it once also dont you think the russians the people we were in a space race with would have said they were fake they confirmed the landing sites from lunar orbit with photographs they are online if you care to look them up also before you start making claims about photographic fakery you should learn something about photography first depth of field is pretty basic stuff
space,not_removed,even if it was a composite since when does composite mean fake by definition does the composite image of proof that the cucumber is fake
space,not_removed,what the fuck are you talking about the camera is focused to infinity note the closest structural bars are very out of focus and get more and more in focus then the dish is close to in focus and the surrounding terrain is in focus its a single image you idiot
space,not_removed,stop being stupid about things you dont understand
space,not_removed,what i dont even they wanted to take a photograph of the area not the details on the lander so they set the focus to infinity so of course details on the lander itself will be out of focus while the ground at least ten meters away or so will be in focus
space,not_removed,dude thats just a narrower focus range before camera phones you had lenses which could focus a projection of light this focal range was limited by the size of the lens if youve ever used a light microscope and observed different layers of a cell by changing focal depth its the same principle
space,not_removed,your comment indicates you have a severe lack of knowledge about photography httpsenwikipediaorgwikihyperfocaldistance
space,not_removed,theyve had the ability since they had movies projected on screens dude the larger the image the higher the resolution
space,not_removed,the camera used for apollo were film that is capable of capturing far more small detail than any consumer grade digital camera sensor
space,not_removed,is this some sort of joke
space,not_removed,like most technology in its early stages it was probably available just prohibitively expensive
space,not_removed,even consumergrade film is at least as good as hd quality when paired with a decent lens the picture here is a ektachrome slide taken with a hasselblad camera at the resolution shown its quality is limited by the scanning process
space,not_removed,do you know what film is
space,not_removed,film begins losing definition somewhere near apollo used film that loses definition somewhere near weve been capable of producing images in greater than hd quality for many years but why let facts get in the way of your paranoia
space,not_removed,absolutely amazing you can clearly see where your tinfoil hat ends and the empty shell you call your head begins
space,not_removed,yes im actually visiting him next week so it will most likely happen its okay that i use my account right just wondering
space,not_removed,i mean the guys an astronaut its a given he had sex
space,not_removed,riama at eastern on august
space,not_removed,if i got that close to the moon and couldnt go on i would be so pissed mad respect for this dude for doing his job
space,not_removed,ummm you kinda revealed some info that narrows the poster to the number of grandkids however this discounts potential out of wedlock grandkids which in theory could be millions
space,not_removed,how is his cardiovascular health these days
space,not_removed,i agree entirely and i have lots of questions but most are about how he wasnt on the moon he stayed in orbit he was the most isolated human in history
space,not_removed,did armstrong ever write one
space,not_removed,i sincerely feel your comment is severely underrated
space,not_removed,his didnt walk on the moon he was the command module pilot
space,not_removed,i think youre right ordinary people wouldnt have the mental stability to be able to go on a journey like that with all the dangers involved and the big chance of not coming home safely and i think youll need extreme will power to keep on going instead of just gazing and being astonished and more gazing i would spend all my oxygen by just staring and admiring
space,not_removed,hey im considering the same thing ive always been really interested in everything russia culture history music geography etc im saving money now for a trip next year to russia well ill be driving across all of russia london to mongolia via russia over the course of several months with a few other people its actually a semiorganized event called the mongol rally google it if youre interested
space,not_removed,i saw the reflection but not the mountain guess i should have seen that coming
space,not_removed,the lighting also messes with the perspective its actually enormous httpsenwikipediaorgwikimonshadley about the size of everest from base to tip
space,not_removed,is everything under moonlight when youre on the moon
space,not_removed,everests height is ft above sea level mt st helens is ft above sea level pikes peak is ft above sea level the highest peak in the continental contiguous states is mt whitney at ft above sea level take those comparisons as you will edit contiguous not continental as someone corrected me
space,not_removed,that is mons hadley its feet high there is no atmosphere on the moon to make distant objects seem fuzzy
space,not_removed,dont worry youll be one step ahead of your parents youll watch mars landings
space,not_removed,the google lunar xprize contestants would really kick it into high gear
space,not_removed,this especially not in the or wed be able to tell much easier now such an amazing feat
space,not_removed,i could understand that an eva without a plss or ops would be considered risky lose a hose and you are toast in that confined space it could take minutes to close the top hatch and recompress
space,not_removed,he did a lot of spray painting and they tended to clean their tools with some nasty things also he worked on the lander but also worked on other things too like the tomcat helped built the full size wooden model to show the navy
space,not_removed,i have no idea but would say anything from away definitely a couple days to reach the base of it at meters its definitely not an impossible hike over a number of days though
space,not_removed,its an issue of exposure and dynamic range if you were in a dark place held your phone still and pointed it at the stars youd be able to get the stars in a phone picture conversely if you did the exact same thing yet the moon or other bright object was in the frame your phone would adjust the exposure for the moon and the stars wouldnt show up the difference in brightness of the moon and stars causes the problem because the camera doesnt have enough dynamic range to catch both properly in a single exposure
space,not_removed,none taken ive never seen this question being asked yes i was born a few decades after the landing
space,not_removed,ive heard it a few times but its a question worth asking and answering
space,not_removed,houston we have a problem we didnt bring our passports
space,not_removed,at least theyd have tim hortons
space,not_removed,yeah dude space is weird just so spacey man all that literally fuckin space i kinda see why people get freaked in deep water now i get feeling looking into that dark ass space
space,not_removed,sorry i hadnt thought of it until just now
space,not_removed,sadly theres no shortage of youtube scientists watching documentaries om how it was all faked watching them and reading comments is a mix of horrified fascination and tragicomedy and for whatever reason most of them are very religious i suppose landing on the moon is heresy
space,not_removed,i am sure really sure i would believe it due to the mass hysteria mainstream media propagating it none stoplate reply
space,not_removed,thats really beautiful especially the avocado
space,not_removed,before camera phones you had lenses which could focus a projection of light wat camera phones work the exact same way due to the extremely short focal length they use they have a very high depth of field even at wide apertures which means focus is usually not critical
space,not_removed,holy shit please do this if possible if you can convince him to do an ama go to riama and underneath rules and faqs on the sidebar request to be added to the calendar just follow the instructions and give proof if you can get an ama with him that would be incredible having an astronaut as a grandfather is no small thing
space,not_removed,are you kidding me man the apollo program had been a fascination of mine my entire life it would be an absolute honor to ask him a question unbelievable i hope he is well and as long as you have proof i dont see how your account is a big deal could always make a throwaway
space,not_removed,i amongst many people with a burning passion for all things space related would kill for the opportunity to interact with someone who made my childhood dreams into tangible reality
space,not_removed,i really really hope this doesnt become another safe
space,not_removed,question one mr worden how does it feel to have a sack of pens for a grandchild
space,not_removed,perhaps create an alt account separate your previous comment history from his statements
space,not_removed,remindme week ask usackofpens about his grandfather ama
space,not_removed,has he figured out how to sit down i mean going to the moon with todays technology would be pretty neat back in the with technology that takes some serious balls respect seeing the lunar surface from orbit must have been amazing
space,not_removed,theres definitely been amas in the past where the persons grandson basically interpreted the questions to the person and typed up the responses
space,not_removed,what he already revealed that by saying that his grandfather was the cmp for apollo there was only one his name is al worden thats a publicly known fact
space,not_removed,there were five others like him
space,not_removed,no more isolated than any other cm pilot
space,not_removed,he did not at least not in the same way that the others ive listed did who each ghostwrote their memoirs and in aldrins case ghostwrote multiple interesting books he did authorize a biography written by nasa historian james hansen there is a good deal of firstperson perspective from armstrong in this book neil was also the subject of another more recent biography written by journalist jay barbree this to me is the more interesting book of the two as it covers a wider range of neils life but correspondingly less of his apollo experience
space,not_removed,isnt that why they chose test pilots for the first astronauts their ability to stay chill under the most stressful of circumstances these were the kind of people who already learned to deal with the thought that they werent coming home from their next flight
space,not_removed,i only went to st petersburg and chelyabinsk i loved that country youll have a blast its so beautiful there
space,not_removed,and there i figured it was about the size of a largeish hill
space,not_removed,now that is fucking neat i thought it was at most bout feet tall but thats fucking cool man
space,not_removed,thank you for the perspective that is so interesting i guess the lack of atmosphere distortion and the smoothness lead to the illusion of it being a hill
space,not_removed,id love to jump off it imagine that with moon gravity
space,not_removed,what thats extremely confusing but i guess using sea level messes up the measurements as hadley would be and everest would be but ignoring sea level would make it vs technically correct but wrong from our perspective from land to land everest is still i mean mauna kea in hawaii is only but its actually over if you include whats under the ocean edit i dont know if explained that well enough base to peak everest and mons hadley isnt underwater mauna kea is underwater everest is a heck of a lot higher than hadley edit also just wanted to give respect to httpsenwikipediaorgwikijohnhadley for his scientific effort long ago for which this was named after a reflecting octant
space,not_removed,not trying to be an ass but everest is km so although still incredible its nowhere near the size of everest edit i understand what you meant turns out i was being an ass carry on
space,not_removed,under earthlight perhaps
space,not_removed,just good ol fashion sunlight even moonlight is just sunlight reflected off the lunar surface
space,not_removed,you mean contiguous not continental
space,not_removed,mt mckinley is actually the tallest in the continental us at and pikes peak is for what its worth usually its said to be though even to the point of all the tourist stuff they sell at the shop on it stating such for legacy reasons source i live right under pikes peak
space,not_removed,also mythbusters did an episode on the moon landing all fake theories was busted
space,not_removed,its because the lunar soil is far brighter than the dark skies you have to expose for one or the other either you expose for the sky and see stars but the moon will be overexposed or you expose for the moon but the sky will be dark it works the same way on earth go to a night baseball game and take some picture without the flash if the game is properly exposed the night sky will appear totally dark if you use a long exposure for the sky the game will be very overexposed
space,not_removed,years ago you could cross the canadian border either direction with nothing more than and a pack of lucky strikes
space,not_removed,and for whatever reason most of them are very religious i suppose landing on the moon is heresy im not a religious man myself but i have great respect for the religious people who embrace science as a way of exploring and learning about gods creation i feel like the antiscience crowd among those religious groups would hold those same opinions with or without their faith theyd just find some other reason to justify their opinions
space,not_removed,found it not my original content sorry if i made that impression
space,not_removed,will do i will check the rules out im sure he would be happy to do it
space,not_removed,my great uncle was vladimir komarov and from what i heard of him he would have loved to talk about the soviet space program unfortunately it was the very same thing he loved that killed him
space,not_removed,gthaving an astronaut as a grandfather is no small thing but getting an ama with him is one giant leap for redditkind edit do quotes not work on mobile
space,not_removed,riama at eastern on august
space,not_removed,i concur would love to have an ama from him
space,not_removed,going to leave here as a taste of what an ama with al worden would be like
space,not_removed,having a grandfather as an astronaut could be a problem however immediate mission scrub
space,not_removed,sounds good it will probably happen soon
space,not_removed,i really really hope this doesnt become another safe yeah please dont use a crowbar and an angle grinder to force your grandad open only to find a spider and a broken smoke alarm
space,not_removed,i assumed he had greater altitude hes the most isolated in the guiness book of records not suggesting that truly means anything but i wondered why they gave him the honour
space,not_removed,didnt he have slightly higher altitude or something i know the guiness book of records list him as the most isolated human i dont know for sure why they did that i agree that its not going to be much of a difference between the other cm pilots but i figured they must have a reason for giving him the credit
space,not_removed,your edit is exactly how im reacting to this haha
space,not_removed,i just came back from visiting the gloriousness that is in huntsville for the first time look up any picture on the internet you want and it will never do any of it justice i cried a little when i saw the saturn v i had the time of my life but i left feeling terrified it was terrifyingly beautiful those crafts were nothing more than metal switches knobs and some kind of seats and some insulation while combustion of incredible proportions is happening under your ass and the engineers who put in countless hours solving problems on the ground hoping beyond all hope it all works like i said look at all the pictures you want theyre interesting they will never ever tell you how overwhelming it really is double rainbow guy doesnt have shit on me after seeing what i saw right now edit and what i mean by terrifying is that i wouldnt drive some of those crafts around a parking lot and brave people sat in them and flew into the sky im still trying to process it its just amazing isnt even the word i feel bad i only live a mornings drive away from those redstones but i will tell you this you have to see it to believe it ive been forever changed about how the hell we got off this rock and what it took to do it
space,not_removed,yeah probably i wonder how these people live today is a fine day to die in the morning and a good thing im still there in the evening ok not every day was dangerous but still
space,not_removed,the apollo crew tried driving down the bottom part of that mountain and came to a grinding halt when the front wheels dug into the surface and pulled the lrv into a degree turn
space,not_removed,free fall is free fall it wouldnt feel any different also lack of atmospheric drag means your speed will increase quadratically linearly until you hit the ground
space,not_removed,youd keep accelerating and then disintegrate on the surface
space,not_removed,the point is that while everest and the himalayas are high they sit on an elevated plateau whereas i believe that height is actually relative to the astronauts for mons hadley but yeah highest is a little bit arbitrary mount mckinleydenali and mauna kea would both beat out hadley by that measure and there are other metrics that would put other mountains higher eg chimborazo is furthest from the centre of the earth
space,not_removed,what you are looking for is httpsenwikipediaorgwikitopographicprominence a ft peak where the surrounding area is ft isnt very special but if it was on a ft plain that is huge
space,not_removed,are they often racing up there or is it just during that one week a year
space,not_removed,it moved a foot up since i was last there atta boy
space,not_removed,the technology and skills were there back then they just didnt take tripodmounted pictures of the sky because they were there to take pictures of the moon
space,not_removed,not really the same thing happens today on earth go and shoot a night baseball game and try to expose the stars and the game at the same time you wont be able to without using photoshop
space,not_removed,its fascinating its like the fundamentalist antiscience crowd doesnt want to believe their deity is great enough to invent some wildly complicated laws of physics or a humongous reality for them to work in
space,not_removed,that would definitely be an ama worth reading it kind of blows my mind that humans diddo that shit i piss myself climbing onto the roof
space,not_removed,aw man i cant wait for this
space,not_removed,i really dont wanna miss this thisd be a fantastic ama
space,not_removed,how did he enter the astronaut program
space,not_removed,ask him if he seen aliensufos
space,not_removed,do it man seriously they would be awesome id love to know how it felt for h his memories his emotions what is missing from other peoples accounts
space,not_removed,your great uncle was a true leader in the soviet space program he was the first cosmonaut to fly both the voskhod and the soyuz the soyuz having numerous problems that he worked for hours to correct but eventually cost him his life of the old cosmonauts alexey leonov is the only one i know of who has shared his stories of those days what your great uncle and yuri gagarin could have told us would have been fantastic all space enthusiasts morn their deaths edit i sometimes think it would have been komarov and leonov on the first soviet crew to try for the moon if things had gone differently
space,not_removed,would really love to see an ama from him insane amount of respect for the people from the apollo program grew up with space always being a fascination of mine to be able to ask a real astronaut a question would be amazing
space,not_removed,thats awesome thanks your grandfather is an amazing human being
space,not_removed,they probably do it the martian way consider it briefly then put it aside and get to work
space,not_removed,so they hit the end of the playable area
space,not_removed,the first high marking on the moon
space,not_removed,doesnt the lessened gravity mean youre not being pulled towards the ground as fast i dunno probably not but thats what i think the comment youre responding to most likely assumed
space,not_removed,no velocity will increase linearly with time and iirc with the square root of the distance fallen not quadratically
space,not_removed,well i cant speak for any misc idiots but the legal racing is just once a year sadly
space,not_removed,yeah cause all you need to do is make insane claims and then tell people to do their own research when they question you super easy
space,not_removed,this they could have shielded the camera from the light of the sun and the reflected light of the surface and then taken photographs of the stars but why should they have done that they were there to examine the moon and they only had a limited amount of film to take photographs with they already knew what photographs of stars look like coincidentally there actually are some apollo photographs on which you can see some celestial objects eg photograph from apollo shows a bright spot which later was confirmed to be venus
space,not_removed,it freaks my balls out that the hill in the pic is either meters away or miles away
space,not_removed,riama at eastern on august
space,not_removed,id love this just from the simple fact of pissing off spielberg conspiracist
space,not_removed,can you sum up what exactly an ama is
space,not_removed,ive seen plenty of tourists and unidentified flying oranges
space,not_removed,no the front wheels dug into the surface and pulled the lrv into a degree turn
space,not_removed,youll be accelerated slower yes but the acceleration wont stop in km youll attain a truly splattering speed unlike earth where the atmosphere prevents you from exceeding terminal velocity you would just keep going faster and faster
space,not_removed,youre also falling slower at first giving you more time to fall and accelerate it would be really interesting to graph fall rates in different gravitates there are probably significant diminishing returns especially when you add more atmosphere
space,not_removed,when you fall you are being accelerared by an approximately constant force this acceleration is smaller on the moon however on earth there is also a force in the opposite direction drag which depends on your current velocity at some point the two forces cancel out and you no longer accelerate this is called terminal velocity and depends in your mass and shape thats how parachutes work its also why there have been people who survived falling out of an airplane at cruise altitude on the moon there is no atmosphere to speak of so you never stop accelerating until you hit the ground
space,not_removed,ah yes i was thinking about the distance travelled for some reason thanks for tye correction
space,not_removed,yes i recall seeing some footage of an astronaut bounding toward a hill and he soon realized it was a mountain and much further away and bigger than they expected on the moon there are no points of reference so your perception is out of whack
space,not_removed,o shit i didnt even realize that was a hill i thought it was just something reflecting off the glass
space,not_removed,plus once you realize how inhospitable and deadly it is out on there on the moon its even scarier this picture is werid to me itd be so awesome to be on the moon but itd also freak me the fuck out
space,not_removed,an ama is basically a giant question and answer session on reddit you make a thread on the ama subreddit people submit questions you respond its done a lot by people who are famous accomplished or who do weird and unusual things ie driving robots in sewers
space,not_removed,sure it what said im not fast on the keyboard draw
space,not_removed,ama stands for ask me anything generally people who have had unique life experiences accomplished interesting things or are famous for one thing or another will do amas on reddit spending their evening answering whatever questions reddit can throw at them
space,not_removed,the other guy covered what it is now head over to riama and see them in action
space,not_removed,ooooooohh thanks for clearing that up
space,not_removed,can you expand on that why would the distance perception get messed up is there a comparative example from the earth
space,not_removed,i had no idea that this is the case on the moon best thing ive learned all week thank you
space,not_removed,thanks for the info it sounds really cool
space,not_removed,in addition to all the other distance cues that have already been mentioned another big one is atmospheric effects that are entirely absent on the moon on earth we have haze dust waterhumidity in the air that adds up the farther away something is even on a clear day with little haze the air will affect the colors of distant objects and our brains have learned to interpret all that as distance
space,not_removed,depth perception works in a lot of different ways but one of the major ones is size clues the brain learns for example how big ish a car is and then it starts to learn how that sized car looks at different distances when looking around in our world there are lots of objects that the brain can use to build the perception of depth in its surroundings it takes in all the different sizes and distances that it sees and gives you depth perception of these different object so basically on the moon where theres nothing to reference also on earth when you see a hill and you see a mountain they look different and so your brain knows theyre different sizes on the moon a mountain is just a giant hill they look similar so the brain cant tell how big it is that in addition to not having any other visual clues for size reference leaves you with messed up depth perception sorry if this doesnt make sense i just got off my graveyard shift
space,not_removed,the lack of airatmosphere means there is no haze so no matter how far away something is it is crystal clear
space,not_removed,there are no trees clouds buildings or anything that you know the size of
space,not_removed,there are a number of places in the american southwest like that i took last week along in utah perhaps it looks like a few largish boulders until you realize that the speck at the bottom left of center is a car the feeling of scale confusion is definitely stronger in person than in the image by the way
space,not_removed,because there is no atmosphere on the moon so things far away look as clear
space,not_removed,like trees famously we also imagine the moon itself is bigger when its near the horizon this is an illusion its always approx thumbnail at arms length sized
space,not_removed,this may not be the best example but ive experienced this a few times while being up in the mountains theres a ski resort in colorado called arapahoe basin and along the backside of the resort is the montezuma bowl the summit of montezuma bowl is well above the tree line and each slopetrail is very wide due to the lack of natural features around you it can be difficult to judge distances angles and speed so people can end up moving a lot faster than they expected i think thats why so many people tend to make mistakes and hurt themselves closer to the summit that to the base its much more easier to judge speed and distances once you get about halfway down because the trails being to narrow and you end passing below the tree line its crazy how much of a difference the objects around you can influence your perception of distance and speed
space,not_removed,i suppose it happens here on earth as well the size of the moon for example looks different to us as it rises in the night sky when you see it low over the horizon looks huge relative to the skyline as it reaches its high point far from the horizon it looks smaller but its actually the same size the entire time when we look at a large expanse of landscape here we can usually tell the difference bw a mountain and a hill in the distance due to other things in our line of sight to compare them to also those false hills where a road looks like its going up but its actually a downhill section signs will tell drivers to put the car in neutral and they can feel like theyre rolling uphill this is due to the surrounding landscape making an illusion hope im explaining this somewhat accurately
space,not_removed,along with everything else mentioned the moon is smaller so the horizon is closer
space,not_removed,oh youre welcome its something that comes to mind often it is fascinating
space,not_removed,it stands for ask me anything
space,not_removed,i like the fact that orion nebula is clear as hell in this picture im always more amused by the nebula than the orion itself
space,not_removed,it looks so small incredible to think of everything that galaxy could potentially hold perhaps there is a space telescope pointed at us
space,not_removed,i was just thinking the same thing how incredibly eerie is it to think that there could be a life looking at hubble or voyager wondering what it was
space,not_removed,to me its scarier to think theres nobody looking back
space,not_removed,wait wait wait sun go supernova thats not gonna happen no way could our sun go supernova
space,not_removed,its not too sad if you consider the idea that there is absolutely nothing we have ever found that tells us we arent a part of an artificially formulated universe something created as a school project and got a c on
space,not_removed,but we would already be out of the loop by then traveling the stars and seeing new galaxies shits gonna be lit yo
space,not_removed,perhaps humans or their machines will rise to the point where they can determine what happens to the universe source i read a lot of scifi
space,not_removed,look at what hawking says about this id trust his words
space,not_removed,naw man its gonna happen our sun will fuse until it builds up so much iron itll collapse however humans as a species will have evolved or gone extinct by then or possibly moved to another planet
space,not_removed,rick and mortys microverse episode
space,not_removed,what does he say about this
space,not_removed,if the result of a collision of galaxies the largest known collider what else wold cause such a release of energy and make a galaxy look like a fur ball
space,not_removed,i dont think we have an overpopulation problem but space colonization would not solve it if we did if we colonize mars we will only send a tiny fraction of earths population there if we have billions of people living offworld it will be because the vast majority of them were born offworld with a higher birthrate than we have on earth i believe in space mining as a way to provide resources for earth but that is also a hard sell prices of spacecraft and launches need to come down dramatically for it to work even mining asteroids for resources to use out there has not been proven to be cost effective
space,not_removed,try these arguments for every dollar invested in apollo at least or was returned as increased gdp growth source the book human universe by brian cox if the dinosaurs had a space program theyd still be around today there is nothing more important than ensuring the survival of our species through interplanetary redundancy
space,not_removed,i think youre right if we took the primitive returnoninvestmenthereandnow approach we wouldnt even achieve orbit space requires effort there are no shortcuts there once we figure out how to make say asteroid mining profitable the money will pour in but until then well have to patiently spend spend spend as a sidenote there will be other problems to consider like separatism i imagine possible war between earth and martian colonies like in the expanse
space,not_removed,i doubt these kind of people have open minds to any of the topics then let alone space exploration i believe listeningdiscussing with an open mind is a personal trait it might be stronger on some topics but it depends on person
space,not_removed,let me annoy you further we use technologies derived from space exploration everyday our communications all rely on assets in space that is space utilization not space exploration weve explored earths orbit in the and there is no economic benefit in going further out many solutions to our problems here on earth such as overpopulation and lack of resources can be solved by space exploration no it will never be justified to ship people offworld or to ship in resources from offworld compared to more efficient utilization of available space and resources with some optimization we can support hundreds of billions more and the global populations is unlikely to reach in the tens of billions anyway the entire space exploration shtick is driven by less than perfectly rational motivations
space,not_removed,are we ranting about reddit trolls or do you actually talk to these people i dont think i know anybody whod argue that personally but ive seen it on here
space,not_removed,never argue with a fool you will lower yourself to their level then they will win by virtue of experience
space,not_removed,well i happen to belong to them as far as manned missions are concerned i also think your line of reasoning is rather weak and what infuriates you is that your weak reasoning doesnt catch on we use technologies derived from space exploration everyday we do but most technologies arent derived from space exploration the internet is partly derived from planning for nuclear war and id rather we stop doing that instead of doubling down to create another couple of spinoffs also the money spent on the moon race was absolutely gigantic compared with the derived technologies directly investing it in rd would have created some other fantastic technologies but since we never did that you cant balance them against what came of from space exploration our communications all rely on assets in space unmanned satellites manned space exploration wasnt ever necessary for that many solutions to our problems here on earth such as overpopulation and lack of resources can be solved by space exploration thats just handwaving i dont see how overpopulation would be solved by space exploration it would be massively more efficient to solve the resource problem by recycling and invention of new materials than wasting even more resources on building rockets to bring back metal from asteroids the future of our entire species is in space says who the future of our entire species is in space only if we continue destroying the only proven habitat we have and then have to flee to some interplanetary slum it is as yet completely unclear how the human organism would react to an environment rich in hard cosmic rays remember that lead apron over your nuts when you last got an xray low in gravity and how the human mind reacts to years of sensory deprivation hint probably not very great httpspaceaboutcomodfrequentlyaskedquestionsacanwomengetpregnantinouterspacehtm and giving birth in space is as yet unexplored outside animal models but given the sensitivity of fetal tissue to radioactivity i have some doubts it would be working out great space medicine is not there yet afaik no one has done operations or resuscitation in space what about and ovaried thats going to bring a lot of pressure to the group probably culminating in violence one day and without a way to avoid contact thats not going to be fun unless we dream up humongous space ships who would go into a research lab to raise their kid without them ever driving a bike seeing grass or playing in the sun and rain so what would happen to kids growing up in an absolutely artificial environment and mars dust wont be better it doesnt matter a lot for small expeditions but it will matter massively over years the experiences we have with asbestos and miners working over long time underground arent great so sorry while i think money spend on probes to other planets any maybe even other solar systems is wellspent not in an economical sense spending it on human space exploration is moronic each mission gets easily or as expensive because you have those bags of water to protect and theres only so much money for space missions
space,not_removed,the argument boils down to money as with everything in america nasa needs a new charter they need to become the equivalent of the department of transportation but for our solar system privatizing solar system exploration is the only way forward
space,not_removed,point them to the books on spin offs of the space program a ton of things we have today are a direct result of the space program
space,not_removed,i know right it so mind blowing fuck the cure for cancer could be a mineral on an astroid obviously im reaching but its not impossible
space,not_removed,wow your user name is very accurate however maybe i need to elaborate a little we consider the earth to be overpopulated because its resources are not enough to sustain all of us in the long term and because of our combined emissions space mining for resources advancements in agriculture including lab grown meat and the development of better green technologies for energy would decrease our impact on the planet
space,not_removed,i am generally for space exploration but when i discuss with smarter people than me i tend to disagree with my own views just to make that other person use even better arguments against me i learn a lot from that anyway while what youre saying may be true and is the same thing i told my friend once he replied that while space exploration is expensive its relatively cheap compared to other things also the potential income from space exploration is massive if the economic risk of exploring space is low then its definitely worth it
space,not_removed,no these people are real sadly im related to more than a few of them
space,not_removed,no these are actual people i work with and see on a daily basis i dont rant about internet trolls its a waste of time this time it was my brother
space,not_removed,if everyone had like children the population would stabilize however i feel like the more spread out our species is throughout the galaxy the higher our chance for survival as a whole
space,not_removed,potential income from space exploration is massive no its not no resource is worth importing from there using them for habitation is pointless and there is very little gain from zerog manufacturing
space,not_removed,ahhh of course family is so much fun haha
space,not_removed,no resource is worth importing from there there is no way for you to know that this is true what resources are abundant now may be scarse in the future and may be something we need a lot of or some resource we havent even heard of might be found and trigger whole new lines of research which might aid humanity there are so many things about humanity it would be worth fixing or getting rid of before quitting space exploration
space,not_removed,sorry the burden of proof of your pieinthesky claims pun intended are on you what resources are abundant now may be scarse in the future recycling engineering around the shortages our basic materials are also the most common for a reason or some resource we havent even heard of might be found no its entirely impossible earth is quite representative of all elements that can be found throughout the universe trigger whole new lines of research which might aid humanity extremely unlikely examples please
space,not_removed,recycling engineering around the shortages our basic materials are also the most common for a reason helium no its entirely impossible earth is quite representative of all elements that can be found throughout the universe compounds that would either be impossible to create here or too expensive to be profitable if it exists perhaps dark matter is something extremely useful to us extremely unlikely examples please impossible to exemplify again space exploration is cheap enough to be justified when the economical risk is low and the outcome might be huge its the same thing with all other scientific research people are researching things that may prove to be useless in the future but right now its being invested upon solely because someone thinks it may lead to something good every time youre wondering why are they doing this or why arent they doing it this way instead the answer is always because they think its profitable or they would have done it differently if they thought it was more profitable edit also sorry the burden of proof of your pieinthesky claims pun intended are on you sorry humanity is already doing space exploration because people think its worth it youre the one who disagrees with thousands of decisionmakers i believe the burden of proof is on you to prove everyone wrong the burden of proof is not something you can just throw out there when someone disagrees with you
space,not_removed,you know that ancient greeks also thought the same they have already made all discoveries and they know everything about nature you can see how naive they were you never know what long term consequences will be from the simple rock drilling operation in space
space,not_removed,the ancient greeks in contrast to us had no focused science program and no industrial culture where companies push for innovation and discoveries to survive in the marketplace human knowledge is growing like crazy because we do have all this space exploration probably is one of the most inefficient ways to do discoveries
space,not_removed,it is not industries and corporations to blame but peoples mindset
space,not_removed,i was just reading on the what the flux system the other day i think they are too far apart to be related but im keeping an open mind it seems weve been getting alot of wacky space news lately i like where your mind is though
space,not_removed,well you cant have a black half and yes aliens are real why do you think so many people want a wall
space,not_removed,thanks now im not going to get anything done for the rest of at work
space,not_removed,well thats pretty awesomemy productivity level just plummeted
space,not_removed,httpjdhcodelabcomgravity i didnt create this but ive spent hours playing with it and wanted to share
space,not_removed,is there any way to remove the points this seems quite simple at the moment
space,not_removed,i wish the snake boys knew about gravity
space,not_removed,they eventually just explode after enough of them combine
space,not_removed,im not sure its correct to think of nothingness as some empty space that the universe is expanding into like a balloon growing bigger in an empty room where the somethingness of the inside meets the nothingness of the outside at the balloons expanding rubber edge rather the universe is all that is and the space between each point inside it is becoming larger over time so were calling that growth despite the fact that its not growing into anything people can feel free to correct me if im wrong here this is just the best ive been able to interpret what ive read
space,not_removed,nope doesnt work that way the first thing to understand is this the universe is expending period not into anything not around anything just expanding if thats uncomfortable for you then dont even worry about it too much just focus on our observable universe years of light travel time and accept that the space between galaxies is expanding second the universe is all of space and time if there is anything outside the universe it is probably not space or time and probably not outside in the way that we understand it third apparently you can create something out of nothing were all here after all on the quanum level particles pop in and out of existence all the time out of nothing the truly massive and terrifying mystery of life is why why matter why energy why universejust why its easy to take the fact that the universe exists for granted whats frustrating about that is that it could be unknowable
space,not_removed,could we somehow exist in nothingness id say the answer is yes and no lets imagine that there actually is a multiverse and our universe is just one of many lets imagine each is separated by true nothingness even if there is a sea of nothingness between the universes its the same as if the universe are right up against eachother in fact to speak of a sea of nothingness is meaningless nothingness is nothing it has no dimension like empty space does its the lack of existence in other words universes separated by nothingness are separated by nothing if you have universes separated by nothing all you have is existence no matter how many universes you have an infinite number or just it only makes sense to talk about existence nothingness by definition doesnt exist therefore a universe surrounded by a sea of nothingness isnt surrounded by anything there would be no meaningful concept of outside anymore than there would be a meaningful concept of nothingness existing inside the centre of an electron
space,not_removed,no the laws that govern our universe were set in place a short time after the moment of creation we dont know what is that nothingness the space expands into as the spacestime as we know and love does not exist outside of our universe and for all we know the space nor time exist there
space,not_removed,it is a perception problem what we are calling everything is only part of everything nothing is everything and that which we call everything is only something in the midst of nothing which is everything matter antimatter there is a physics of nothing
space,not_removed,i think it makes more sense to just say things are growing apart
space,not_removed,this really is on the edge of our understanding love it though
space,not_removed,im wondering if we could even understand it with human logic if an extremely smart alien species that lets say have the answers for a lot of questions would explain it to us maybe its just our brain that thinks there has to be an answer thanks for sharing your thoughts
space,not_removed,interesting article
space,not_removed,maybe its just our brain that thinks there has to be an answer i was thinking about making that point when we use the word nothingness like a noun our brain treats it like a noun like a thing this reminds me of a time i heard about kepler trying to discover a law of physics to explain why there were only planets he had multiple premises wrong his question was meaningless
space,not_removed,im surprised those tests are still needed isnt that a standard shape for reentry and splashdown
space,not_removed,its not just the shape that matters but a plethora of different characteristics i imagine mass distribution structural integrity etc
space,not_removed,cars are all the same basic shape but each one still has to be crash tested before it can be driven because each has different characteristics
space,not_removed,atlantis departing
space,not_removed,theres no telling for sure due to months of contradictory statements by mr trump and his surrogates chances are however that budget deficit realities will force a cut in all discretionary federal spending which would include nasa in order to pay for proposed tax cuts and increases in defense spending as well as other proposed initiatives
space,not_removed,hes going to channel all the money nasa is wasting on political and social programs back to space exploration and development i expect trump to increase the budget if not this year than at some point in his term
space,not_removed,ah but the social programs nasa hosts are invaluable to the people who are in them being in one personally us as a team have experienced things that you would not be able to do until you worked for an aerospace company httpswwwnasagovofficeseducationcenterskennedytechnologynasarmchtml httpswwwnasagovaudienceforstudentsstudentlaunchhomeindexhtml
space,not_removed,keep telling yourself that
space,not_removed,approximately billion years ago the solar system was a cloud of dust and gas known as a solar nebula gravity collapsed the material in on itself as it began to spin forming the sun in the center of the nebula
space,not_removed,i feel so lucky to be able to have seen the first up close uranus and pluto pictures in my lifetime ceres was pretty cool too
space,not_removed,whats happening here once every martian years earth years sunlight heats up the atmosphere enough that air near the surface starts to rise bringing dust into the atmosphere with it these storms often originate from one basin the httpswwwpsiedusitesdefaultfilesimagesepoexplorecratershellasmarsoveralljpg a huge ancient impact crater because the temperature at the bottom of the basin can be as much as degrees warmer then the martian average the dust then encircles the planet where it remains for a few weeks before settling the last one was in so hopefully well see another one soon also just because its amazing indias mom mission and opportunity rover
space,not_removed,it could be that it just takes a while for the sources to replenish themselves smith said maybe theres some kind of cycle that the dust has to go through to get back into the right places to trigger a new one or maybe its just kind of luck scientists have been tracking these global dust storms on mars for more than a century using both telescopes on earth and spacecraft orbiting mars the storms have been observed a number of times since most recently in now more than eight years later smith is hopeful hell get the chance to study a major storm soon were overdue for a global dust storm and it could be saving up a really big one this year so that would kind of fun he said i like the dust storms
space,not_removed,these storms can last for years if you like science fiction and are interested in the terraforming of mars read the red mars series by kim stanley robinson it is amazing
space,not_removed,yet another reason to literally go nuclear with our space program the only thing blocking it is the fear mongering that groups like greenpeace nrdc etc have made nuclear put to be
space,not_removed,people on mars should really be more aware of global warming they only have one mars
space,not_removed,prediction of you can see the illuminati sign in the bottom of the picture
space,not_removed,so theyre trying to see if water was on mars or at least years ago wouldnt the polar ice caps be an indication of moisture hence water
space,not_removed,sooo does that mean marss orbit around the sun is slightly eccentic and when its closest to the sun it gets heated and thats where the heat comes from
space,not_removed,one of the things i love most about space is how those two pictures look like video game renders and not even very good ones haha
space,not_removed,awesome information the opportunity shot is now my phone wallpaper
space,not_removed,how do the dust storms affect the rover
space,not_removed,wow that rover picture is stunning wonder if theres an edited version that fills in the blanks
space,not_removed,this seems factually inaccurate while dust storms occur regularly on mars the big planetwide storms do not occur with a fixed frequency and nobody knows what visits cause the largest dust storms
space,not_removed,this just makes me want to go to mars even more guys they have ice frozen in some polar caps that we might be able to use maybe now just think of what we can do with all that dust every
space,not_removed,well with global warming who knows
space,not_removed,i wasnt sure so i googled it and found this from what i gather the article says dust storms on mars become large enough to encircle the planet every earth years or so and only last up to a few months
space,not_removed,not sure but maybe they will play a key role in terraforming the planet one day some type of devices that generate electricity to most likely underground bases like one of those giant windmills but much bigger that would be able to withstand the ferocity of those sand storms
space,not_removed,the longest recorded storm is the great red spot on jupiter first observed about years ago given that mars is a terrestrial planet i find it hard to believe a storm could last anywhere near that long especially given how tenuous the atmosphere is
space,not_removed,even though this is barely relevant at all i kinda agree with you but at the same time i know it wont happen the public hates fission too much gotta wait for all the advanced fusion stuff
space,not_removed,more like largescale imitation if
space,not_removed,well theyre very white and shiny and icelike caps unfortunately water is not the only thing that turns into ice everything goes solid if it gets cold enough some of those things also look like ice httpsenwikipediaorgwikidryice dryice carbon dioxide what is mars atmosphere made of the atmosphere of mars is about times thinner than earths and it is percent carbon dioxide heres a breakdown of its composition carbon dioxide percent nitrogen percent argon percent oxygen percent carbon monoxide percent also minor amounts of water nitrogen oxide neon hydrogendeuteriumoxygen krypton and xenon see more at
space,not_removed,yes but what was unclear until very recently was to what extent was mars covered in water it doesnt matter if mars had polar caps if they were never melted but it turns out they were in fact liquid and took the form of a northern ocean a discovery a year ago showed and the discovery of a week and a half ago confirmed it
space,not_removed,its the second most eccentric orbit in the solar system third if you count pluto though the aphelion does play a small part in dictating the size of summer dust storms this specific phenomenon has less to do with the distance to the sun and more to do with the seasonal heating cycles themselves
space,not_removed,seasonal heat at least on earth is the result of the angle of the planets axis relative to the ecliptic not the distance from the sun
space,not_removed,its mine too
space,not_removed,less sunlight reaches the surface and dust covers the solar panels both of which limit the energy output and the low visibility essentially halts the progress of the rover thankfully when a passes the rover the dust is blown off of the solar panels which is part of the reason opportunity has survived so unexpectedly long years so far when it was originally designed to last just days
space,not_removed,mars has ice under perhaps the majority of its surface not just at the poles one meter or less underground there is permafrost that is in some places half ice by volume thats outside of the few outright subsurface glaciers
space,not_removed,this google you speak of how might i learn more about it
space,not_removed,is a windmill a viable power source on mars the martian atmosphere is only about the density of earths
space,not_removed,except those mars storms arent ferocious at all the martian atmosphere is nearly nonexistant and so is any force excerted by those winds
space,not_removed,the article on this thread p
space,not_removed,i know it wont happen you know our current mars rover curiosity is nuclear powered right
space,not_removed,lets just wait for the generation that got lead poisoning from all those leaded gasoline fumes to expire twenty years or so to go
space,not_removed,dust storms block solar panels reactors dont need sunlight
space,not_removed,i think they meant to reply to the comment about how wind turbines would be completely useless in mars
space,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikidryice dry ice sometimes referred to as cardice chiefly by british chemists is the solid form of carbon dioxide it is used primarily as a cooling agent its advantages include lower temperature than that of water ice and not leaving any residue other than incidental frost from moisture in the atmosphere it is useful for preserving frozen foods where mechanical cooling is unavailable dry ice sublimes at − °c − °f at earth atmospheric pressures this extreme cold makes the solid dangerous to handle without protection due to burns caused by freezing frostbite while generally not very toxic the outgassing from it can cause hypercapnia abnormally elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood due to buildup in confined locations i am a bot please contact httpswwwredditcomusergregmartinez with any questions or feedback
space,not_removed,sweet thanks for the science lesson
space,not_removed,i do count pluto thanks for including him
space,not_removed,im just guessing but given that i would think that this means once every orbits and the actually repeated is the result of significant digits being rounded off
space,not_removed,wait what marss periods are years long no wonder its so red
space,not_removed,ah thanks for the insight do you have any idea how the rover is currently doing can we expect it to last a couple of more years
space,not_removed,httplmgtfycomqgoogle
space,not_removed,wow you dont happen to be captain america do you if so welcome to reddit
space,not_removed,not at all the strongest martian winds will struggle to push over an empty plastic garbage can
space,not_removed,dust is the major issue in a martian storm not wind
space,not_removed,seen one too many movies about mars that say otherwise i guess thats why they call em movies d
space,not_removed,rtgs are totally different it uses the heat from the natural decay of radioactive materials to power themselves both voyagers use them too
space,not_removed,not by a nuclear reactor but by nuclear decay
space,not_removed,i and apparently the thin atmosphere and lack of oceans means that temperature on mars is less moderated than on earth more extremes but other than that it looks like the axial tilt and its very eccentric orbit both create seasons the planet has two different kinds of seasons that interact throughout the course of a martian year nearly two times longer than what we know as a year there are the familiar winter spring summer and fall caused by the planets tilt — degrees to earths but there are also two additional seasons aphelion and perihelion which occur because of mars highly elliptical orbit earths orbit is nearly circular meaning its distance from the sun stays largely stable mars orbit is more elongated bringing it much closer to the sun at some times of the year than others
space,not_removed,hopefully but the poor old rover is definitely ageing it suffers from memory loss problems where data collected by the rover has to be transmitted to earth within hrs of being collected or else it will be erased the environment also poses a threat its twin rover spirit died in when it got stuck in a sand dune and couldnt get out it probably wont make it past the next years although you never know p
space,not_removed,wait really so the martian was totally wrong
space,not_removed,i wouldnt say totally different nuclear reactors use the heat from accelerated controlled decay they are different just not totally different
space,not_removed,how is using heat to generate electricity in that diffrent from using heat to generate electricity in nuclear power plant
space,not_removed,thanks for this very interesting stuff
space,not_removed,yeah the author mentioned that that was the only point of inaccuracy but was kinda necessary to setup the whole book
space,not_removed,yup the author admitted that he knew that he just wanted a disaster to kick of the plot and he wanted the disaster to originate from mars not failing technology specifically the math goes like this the kinetic energy of the wind is equal to the mass hitting you per second is equal to densitysurface areavelocity so the end result is density on mars is about of earth pressure iirc whoops thats pressure density is so the wind needs to be times faster times faster to be equal to the wind on earth i think the martian says kmh or something so that becomes beaufort or enough to push over a plastic bin not the only error or illogical thing in the martian but it is the most obvious the description of how the spacesuit works is wrong as well
space,not_removed,they had to take some liberties in order to create drama
space,not_removed,an rtg uses slow uncontrolled radioactive decay to create electricity you could leave it alone with no intervention and nothing bad would ever happen a nuclear fission reactor uses a much larger scale nuclear reaction that has to be highly controlled and has the potential to go into meltdown if things go wrong it uses the same fuel in very different ways
space,not_removed,a nuclear fission reactor is usually a controlled bombardment of in a mix of other isotopes with neutrons which outputs a huge amount of energy a bunch of other elements and neutrons causing a chain reaction generating megawatts of power for years rtgs in spacecraft use the natural decay of few kilos of down the decay chain first as as an energy source so their power output is in the order of hundreds of watts
space,not_removed,one is an controlled ongoing explosion the other is a naturally hot rock
space,not_removed,in a power plant the heat is used to boil water to turn a turbine steam turbines dont go on spacecraft
space,not_removed,far from the only point but certainly the biggest and most obvious one
space,not_removed,the movie was even worst as the fix for the door was blowing inward a couple of time
space,not_removed,i thought that the bombardment in a reactor was just a one time thing where the entire process has only to have been started once and then merly kept in control the heat in this reaction is then used to boil water and this is let through steam turbines i understand that an rtg doesnt use a steamengine but in theory the meltdown that happens is just the uranium decaying without being cooled causing it to vaporize itself due through the stupid amount of heat whereas an rtg i think only uses a small piece of decaying isotope does anyone know how an rtg generates power from just heat
space,not_removed,they dont generate electricity via steam they use the thermoelectric principle to generate electricity via a thermocouple which creates a temperature dependent voltage when exposed to heat very stable
space,not_removed,that had more to do wit pressure differential tbh
space,not_removed,did the random guy who downvoted me want to chime in on how they produce electricity im positive that the mechanism i mentioned is how but in the name of constructive discourse i am all ears to hear what part you disagreed on
space,not_removed,well the fix would have to blow outward since the pressure inside the hab is bigger than outside air would be moving out and so would the flap or am i misunderstanding something
space,not_removed,it did blow outward when he did bring the pressure back up inside when he first put it together it wouldve just been wind moving it inside and outside wouldve been equal pressure
space,not_removed,there is the national land cover database which was made using landsat imagery it doesnt contain the imagery itself just gis layers of the classifications it can be found here other satellite data can be downloaded from usgs earth explorer httpearthexplorerusgsgov or usgs glovis websites httpglovisusgsgov in earth explorer if yo go under the feature tab you can sort by land type
space,not_removed,awesome shot remember your settings must have nailed them perfect
space,not_removed,i wrote them down before i went out there with speed film i went with and my dslr remotes were shooting at and iso so i adjusted upwards from there as necessary
space,not_removed,cool thanks came out just right cant believe how sharp the fire and smoke is
space,not_removed,if you zoom in it looks like the rocket has a blah emoticon face hahah
space,not_removed,setup was a challenge too as the rocket was horizontal on the pad while we were preparing the cameras so we had to guess where the pivot point on the strongback was going to place the rocket and focus accordingly
space,not_removed,almost spot on rule of thirds framing is great specially considering the bigger cloud of smoke on the right
space,not_removed,what are the implications of this discovery i mean why is news that ceres has sodium carbonate
space,not_removed,ceres is the laundry stop for solar system travellers either that or a rust removal station via electrolysis
space,not_removed,back before dawn arrived when people said there was a chance ceres could have a subsurface ocean i have to admit i was skeptical now we know there was a vast amount of subsurface water just million years ago this is really really exciting
space,not_removed,does this mean that the bright spots are basically huge celestial elementaryschoolsciencefair volcanoes
space,not_removed,this is a very important result on earth carbonate requires liquid water to form
space,not_removed,stupid question incoming how do they discover stuff like this about places weve never been to
space,not_removed,so major bodies of the solar system that is known to or is suggested to have water at some point in time includes earth the moon mars ceres titan europa ganymede enceladus pluto and the various comets what else
space,not_removed,how likely would it be that their is at least in a microbial form life in our universe
space,not_removed,i am disappointed that so many people cant understand there is a difference between sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate
space,not_removed,well who would have thought that in the future can take off from ceres with vinegar
space,not_removed,i swear im developing some mild form of dyslexia i read the title as sodium carbonate has been found on oreos and i began questioning why nasa was studying oreos
space,not_removed,so does ceres have water now i remember reading about how ceres was supposed to have a lot of water and thus why we sent dawn to it but now whats the verdict does it still have a lot of water ice but no subterranean ocean as once thought
space,not_removed,i am and am not surprised that sodium bicarbonate was found on ceres there seems to be many chemicals found on earth in space one i can think of is the amino acid glycine i am genuinely interested in unknown chemicals we have not found that may exist outside of earth chemistry and pharmacology are awesome because they tell us a lot about how substances work and to find some of these chemicals in space is even more flabbergasting in the sense that theres a fair possibility other parts of the universe are actually quite similar to earth with that in mind a magnitude of ideas can be opened up
space,not_removed,as an engineer i find purescience articles like this incredibly irritating ok theres sodium carbonate but what use is it good for more importantly why is the writer not spontaneously combusting from the irritation of not putting the most important point into their article
space,not_removed,ceres right now
space,not_removed,ceres volcanic activity is actually elementary school science project volcano
space,not_removed,well its a few things its the largest concentration of the salts found outside of earth for it to have formed necessitates liquid water to have existed onin ceres at some point in time within recent geological time the existence of the salt also suggest that there may have been hydrothermal activity on ceres at some point in time since ceres also contain ammoniated phyllosilicates or clays containing ammonia alongside ammonium chloride andor ammonium bicarbonates it suggests that it was formed ataroundor past the orbit of neptune and migrated inwards in the solar system or alternatively it formed close to where it is now but accumulated material formed further out in the solar system overtime combine those bits together it has all sorts of implications for other larger bodies in the solar system
space,not_removed,this is sort of huge carbonates are the missing link on mars they should be all over the place on mars but orbital surveys have not found large deposits we now know that this might be because of the universal coating of dust on mas can mask the real surface chemistry and even mask the color check out the curiosity drill tailings
space,not_removed,de sanctis study finds that the dominant mineral of this bright area is sodium carbonate a kind of salt found on earth in hydrothermal environments this material appears to have come from inside ceres because an impacting asteroid could not have delivered it the upwelling of this material suggests that temperatures inside ceres are warmer than previously believed impact of an asteroid on ceres may have helped bring this material up from below but researchers think an internal process played a role as well more intriguingly the results suggest that liquid water may have existed beneath the surface of ceres in recent geological time the salts could be remnants of an ocean or localized bodies of water that reached the surface and then froze millions of years ago so essentially ceres is warmer than expected and appears to possibly have some hydrothermal activity liquid water may have existed on ceres in recent geological time this means that its more feasible than previously known that life could have existed on ceres at some point
space,not_removed,whenever we learn something about something so far away its news
space,not_removed,whatever everyone else is saying im more interested in the second word or the carbon just having that element means ceres has potential to be something huge
space,not_removed,we can make some tasty wings on ceres
space,not_removed,oh now i get why the spacecraft was called dawn
space,not_removed,or a giant rabeprazole for major heartburn
space,not_removed,its great for dishes too its the primary ingredient in powdered dish detergent
space,not_removed,its just part of the rust removal belt
space,not_removed,what happened to all that water
space,not_removed,thats sodium bicarbonate
space,not_removed,no but it would be amazing for washing cloths
space,not_removed,you know what was awesome about going to mars was that we kind of accept the fact that liquid water is not just a one time deal in the galaxy let alone our own solar system
space,not_removed,eh they have already found evidece of ceres having literally been flooded with liquid water so this is hardly groundbreaking for that it is good to know for many reasons but that particular one isnt as big a deal as you are making it out to be
space,not_removed,httpdawnjplnasagov with a lot of instruments to get a better look
space,not_removed,venus as well iirc one of the hypothesis behind its runaway greenhouse gas is the evaporation of its water also water ice exists all over the place including mercury
space,not_removed,when did our moon have water
space,not_removed,if you are going from an odds perspective it is more unlikely that we are the only life in the universe there are millions of galaxies each with millions of stars which in turn could house trillions of planets if even of those had life on them and only like of that life was intelligent you would still have something like planets with life obviously not all the areas are suitable for life blah blah blah but you get the point i really want to know in my lifetime whether life is something that is common in the universe or if it is a rare occurrence but either way it is extremely likely that there is other life in at the very least microbial forms
space,not_removed,has a very good representation of this
space,not_removed,youre thinking of sodium bicarbonate the stuff they found is just sodium carbonate
space,not_removed,what urspeed said but also and im no expert but these more active moons are usually around huge gas giants with enormous gravity warping and changing the planet constantly
space,not_removed,the moon is hypothesized to have formed when a massive object impacted earth early in the development of the solar system this resulted in it being comprised mostly of materials from the surface of the two primitive bodies earth continued to differentiate due to active geologic processes fueled by radioactive decay but the moon completely solidified relatively quickly that essentially left it stuck where it was
space,not_removed,take a quick look at the article
space,not_removed,the finding is important because it suggests liquid water in a geologically recent time and possibly currently subsurface on earth wherever we find liquid water we find life
space,not_removed,that was an awesome explanation thanks
space,not_removed,combine those bits together it has all sorts of implications for other larger bodies in the solar system such as also what is recent geographic time use earth as a comparison if possible
space,not_removed,remember like ten years ago when the only place that ever had liquid water was earth suddenly it really looks rather more remarkable not to have had it puts a new bound in the drake equation and rather exciting one at that
space,not_removed,can we bring some of the salt back to use on my chips
space,not_removed,true but theres nothing particularly scarce about carbon in the solar system titan has lakes of ethane and there are many other examples like amino acids found in carbonaceous chondrites i dont think there is reason to expect to find organically synthesized anything on ceres but still if we find water anywhere its a great place to look
space,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiabundanceofthechemicalelementsabundanceofelementsintheuniverse ht to
space,not_removed,im mostly interested in the carbon and water because that means you can make methane
space,not_removed,or the deodorizer for the asteroid belt
space,not_removed,it would still work for just about anything you would use sodium bicarbonate for at least any of us that are not professional chemists you might have to use a little more which would mess with the flavor of your food more but thats about it
space,not_removed,the solar systems laundry mat in all seriousness though i have to say the find is pretty cool
space,not_removed,where are you getting that ceres was flooded at any point in time liquid water cannot exist on ceres surface
space,not_removed,when was that reported in regards to ceres on the surface also the evidence in regards to the dawn mission is that water vapor detections suggest hydrothermal activity currently
space,not_removed,i can see venus having it im sure theres some locked away in hydrous melt within the planet but i didnt know about mercury water is pretty much all over our solar system then
space,not_removed,it was within the last few years i recall hearing about evidence of water ice that has been found in craters at the poles
space,not_removed,absolutely thats exactly why you see so much happening on io and europa constant tidal flux keeps them warm
space,not_removed,yeah but the moon would be just as dead even if it had formed independently around the earth the moon is dead because it is too small and the earth is too small and too far away to massage its insides having formed from an impact has little to do with its inactivity
space,not_removed,it wasnt large enough to have formed an atmosphere and the rotation didnt allow for any friction in the core for tectonic movement it just lined up nicely with earth and floats as a neglected step child that was kicked out of club earth
space,not_removed,i am pretty sure the article doesnt mention anything about aliens going to ceres to dupe people into thinking that they bought grade a cormorthian cocaine when in reality it is just laced with ceres atmosphere if you know what i am saying
space,not_removed,brian cox does a good explanation similar to this about titan or neptune not sure which about another type of salt in his series wonders of the solar system if you have netflix you should check it out not sure which episode it is i think number
space,not_removed,httpwwwdictionarycombrowsegeologictime the succession of eras periods and epochs as considered in historical geology so recent is anything between say last week to a few tenshundreds of millions of years ago the solar system and bodies in it being around billions years old in terms of ceres figure it was a good long while back and not really a part of the understandable reference frame for most people as for the implications simply meaning that if a relatively tiny rock like ceres has had enough liquid water on it for a sufficient period of time to allow for the formation of carbonate salts and for hydrothermal activity to exist larger bodies such as mars or many of the moons out there may have had far more of it for far longer allowing for even more complex chemistry to occur this in turn leads to all sorts of bits involving astrobiology chemistry etc when it comes tot hose
space,not_removed,i think what people are saying is that theyre too cool to say they think there could be life on ceres or somewhere with similar chemistry but in fancy language backed by many classy scientific citations in the most secular and nontheistic possible they have their fingers crossed
space,not_removed,well i would say that a decade ago the theoreticalhypothetical basis for conditions under which liquid water could exist were fairly well established however physical evidence of it be it primary or secondary in nature was not yet available or it was buried in the mountains of data we have now sorted through with that in mind we had credible scientists postulating that there may be water in liquid form current or past in all sorts of places hoping to find evidence of it but we also had naysayers with such as much credibility in their positions arguing against it kind of like our current predicament in terms of extra terrestrial life etc we know it is very likely to exist on the basis of the numbers and other things however until we find it arguments against its existence can by many be construed as being just as valid as arguments for its existence only a matter of time though
space,not_removed,you mean like just years ago i remember when it was announced they found evidence of liquid water on mars people were skeptical until officially confirmed and after that there was an explosion of reports from many other bodies in our solar system either the presence or possibility of liquid water or evidence of historical possession of liquid water why is that i think scientists from around the world had access to those reports and understood the conclusions but nobody wanted to rock the boat by trying to contradict the authority body of science reporting whatever that may be
space,not_removed,its been interfering with the smelloscope for centuries
space,not_removed,pretty sure there is even water vapor in the suns atmosphere
space,not_removed,someone should do a mockup of what our moon would look like with an atmosphere it would be pretty
space,not_removed,i watched that but a long time ago but will definitely watch it again thanks for the heads up
space,not_removed,what show is this
space,not_removed,i cant find it on netflix
space,not_removed,i know ceres contains a great deal of water ice but is there any indication that it contains any subsurface oceans like other outer bodies
space,not_removed,i dont know if this hypothesis has since been disproven but i thought it was believed that the asteroid belt was mostly formed from the remains of a shattered planet which by this information once had water or is this water supposedly more recent than that cataclysmic event
space,not_removed,why not carbonate is basic
space,not_removed,not sure but probably httpswwwwikiwandcomenwondersofthesolarsystem
space,not_removed,really does the uk and america have different listing search for brian cox and itll be there
space,not_removed,httpwwwesaintouractivitiesspacescienceherschelherscheldiscoverswatervapourarounddwarfplanetceres and a subsurface layer of liquid water is considered to be a potential source
space,not_removed,disproven there was never a large body in the asteroid belt
space,not_removed,its now thought that the asteroid belt is less a planet that was and rather a planet that could have been were it not for jupiter its prevented from forming a large body by the presence of jupiter most of the protoplanets there might have been were broken up and most of the belts mass was lost in the first million or so years being sent spiralling down into the inner regions or flung outwards by gravitational perturbation from jupiter
space,not_removed,it would work but make for a much less impressive reaction
space,not_removed,they probably do then i know they used to have it but i guess not anymore in america
space,not_removed,if youre comparing a tablespoon of one to the other sure if youve got a planet covered in one it seems less likely to be an issue
space,not_removed,first thing was a satellite but the second one sounds odd i actually saw something similar a month or so ago we took a long exposure picture and all the light trails were traight except the one from the light which was zigzagged
space,not_removed,its weird to see more people noticing the zig zagging star i noticed about three of them in different spots their brighter than most stars
space,not_removed,i dont know about zigzagging but the first one was almost assuredly a satellite they tend to look like slowmoving stars
space,not_removed,post the photo id like to see
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,i thought the weirdest part was that i saw star looking things at the same time ive never seen anything that looked like a star and then i see at the same time crazy
space,not_removed,ohh yea thats gotto be it
space,not_removed,its on my buddies camera but i guess ill try to get it tomorrow
space,not_removed,when you say two do you mean one close by it but more faint
space,not_removed,any progress with that yet
space,not_removed,i saw the slow zig zag one first and i stood up to look at it and i saw another one moving a little faster in a straight line right by the first one
space,not_removed,acceleration due to gravity is never felt how would you feel it you feel acceleration in a car because you are pushing against inertia it exerts pressure on your body fluid in your inner ears sloshes around etc gravity accelerates every molecule in your body in exactly the same way so this doesnt happen no part of your body resists gravity we do feel resisting gravity the rate at which earth moves away from us is much lower than the rate at which gravity pushes us toward it so we feel the force of the ground holding us up this is weight
space,not_removed,the apparent acceleration away from the center of the earth as a result of its rotation amounts to something like a constant at the equator this is just a small fraction of the acceleration due to gravity towards the center of the earth which is
space,not_removed,you do feel it you constantly feel your acceleration towards the earth thats what gravity is acceleration feels different in a car because its short changing and you have external reference cues if you put that same car on a rocket and shot it through space at constant acceleration you wouldnt be able to distinguish it from sitting in your driveway
space,not_removed,but everything rotates around the earth so we arent moving
space,not_removed,honestly i doubt trump will give nasa a budget competent enough to send men back to the moon lets hope private companies can make some major breakthroughs
space,not_removed,obama doesnt configure nasas budget congress does and obama authorizes it i absolutely despise people like you have objectively deny science when it has a conflict of interest with you global warming is not a scam the vast majority of the scientific community and the vast majority of nations have already confirmed manmade climate change is happening and theres steps that can be taken to lessen the blow on our species and it planet as a whole if we act now nasas budget is about of our countries gdp when it was properly funded back during the space race that rate was so saying nasa shouldnt put weather and atmospheric satellites to monitor our changing environment is a huge waste then at least point out the huge waste of a military that we have where we have thousand of pieces of military equipment mothballing in warehouses
space,not_removed,nasa studies the planets earth is a planet hence nasa studies earth
space,not_removed,most people deny science when it is in their favor politics is tribalism masked with philosophy people on the right look the other way on climate change because they like energy money people on the left look the other way on gender and race realism because they like the white mans tax money
space,not_removed,yes very true but ive seen it much more polarizing in the states antivaccinations the whole flat earth thing climate change of course and this whole debacle about evolution and what ive seen in the news lately trumps pick for department of education wants to give billions in american dollars to private christian school such a travesty that is
space,not_removed,global warming space exploration wont matter if we completely destroy our environment and make this planet uninhabitable nasa can do both space exploration and earth science if we give them an actually budget similar to how they used to be funded most of the technology we use today uses oil and in a recent bp study in they concluded at the current rate of use that we will run out of useable oil by the fact is we need to invest in technology that is made of components that are much easily available and dont result in dumping million of tons of into the air the best way to understand the long and short term effects to what were doing to this planet is to invest in earth science send up atmospheric and weather satellites and watch the trends that weve been monitoring for more then years now
space,not_removed,i agree with you on absolutely all of that i also believe that its absurd to think that there are fifty genders or that evolution somehow doesnt apply to humans such that all largescale racial different must be the result of unfair oppression it has been a race to the bottom in this country from both sides
space,not_removed,jesus christ how do idiots like this guy even find their way to rspace good on ya mate for fighting the good fought
space,not_removed,ive been to america for a good couple of years and not all is lost if you can remove the radicals and corruption from your system then you could get back on track youre country is very unique but so was the roman empire and that failed because of internal issues
space,not_removed,its such a shame that the actual science shows youre full of shit
space,not_removed,clap clap glad to see ignorance in america hasnt stopped them yet
space,not_removed,everytime i look at this i get lost everyone ive ever known and everyone ill ever meet fleeting glances just within reach so much to be said and so much left unspoken im a bot please report any issue
space,not_removed,new stars are the lifeblood of our galaxy and there is enough material revealed by this herschel infrared image to build stars for millions of years to come situated lightyears away in the constellation vulpecula – latin for little fox – the region in the image is known as vulpecula it is a stellar association in which a batch of truly giant ob stars is being born the vast quantities of ultraviolet and other radiation emitted by these stars is compressing the surrounding cloud causing nearby regions of dust and gas to begin the collapse into more new stars in time this process will eat its way through the cloud transforming some of the raw material into shining new stars the image was obtained as part of herschels higal keyproject this used the infrared space observatorys instruments to image the entire galactic plane in five different infrared wavelengths these wavelengths reveal cold material most of it between and none of it can be seen at ordinary optical wavelengths but this infrared view shows astronomers a surprising amount of structure in the clouds interior the surprise is that the higal survey has revealed a spiders web of filaments that stretches across the starforming regions of our galaxy part of this vast network can be seen in this image as a filigree of red and orange threads at visual wavelengths the ob association is linked to a star cluster catalogued as ngc it was discovered by william herschel in and contains – stars a nebula emitting visible light catalogued as ngc is also part of this multifaceted starforming region the giant stars at the heart of vulpecula are some of the biggest in the galaxy containing dozens of times the mass of the sun they have short lives astronomically speaking because they burn their fuel so quickly at an estimated age of two million years they are already well through their lifespans when their fuel runs out they will collapse and explode as supernovas the shock this will send through the surrounding cloud will trigger the birth of even more stars and the cycle will begin again
space,not_removed,nbsp im a bot please report any issue on httpsgithubcomopenseadragonredditbotissues
space,not_removed,i was expecting to see a foxlike image c
space,not_removed,what i looked at it and was instantly impressed that it does look like a fox seeing your comment and the fact its just named after the constellation makes me feel a tad crazy but i still see it here ive roughly outlined the one i see and hopefully youll be able to spot in the proper one given its not the best picture of a fox ive seen but i dont think this area of space did such a bad job given that foxes dont exist near it
space,not_removed,thanks for outlining it i saw three foxish shapes but yours is by far the foxyest
space,not_removed,i saw the fox right away as well but im also completely baked
space,not_removed,two fox andor dog faces in the top left too
space,not_removed,woo not just me and i spotted an extrafoxy one thats good to know
space,not_removed,apparently the announcement is an article going up on the site edit heres a link to the reddit discussion
space,not_removed,rumor has it that it will be something moon related
space,not_removed,thought it started at the live stream app says event started but also off air are they late or are they not streaming
space,not_removed,nobody except nasa has done that cool glad to see us getting back into space in a big way next space race wont be us vs russia or china itll be the us vs elon and im fine with that
space,not_removed,it did say pm pacific right
space,not_removed,i read that it might be a moon base
space,not_removed,i was looking for the link but couldnt find any
space,not_removed,they are either late or its just usa today trolling us with a useless stream
space,not_removed,thats what the said
space,not_removed,failing usa today stream sad
space,not_removed,there was no live stream fake news
space,not_removed,god if only hed just go there so i wouldnt have to see his fat orange face
space,not_removed,tldr use of alcohol and other volatile compounds are controlled on iss due to impacts their compounds can have on the stations water recovery system spilling beer during some drunken orbital hijinks could also risk damaging equipment we dont allow car drivers or jet pilots to be drunk and in charge of their vehicles so it is hardly surprising the same rules apply to astronauts inside a billion space station travelling through a near vacuum at without the assistance of gravity liquid and gases can tumble around in an astronauts stomach causing them to produce rather soggy burps drinking alcohol at higher altitudes does not get you drunker faster
space,not_removed,the russian thinks all these rules are for pussy theyve been drinking for years in space
space,not_removed,i am i cant do it but i really love and support here around my place
space,not_removed,i too want to get i to it but my wife is hesitant on okaying the price of a proper mount i already justified the dslr for the kids but i want that sirius tripod
space,not_removed,flagstaff arizona actually has light pollution regulations because they have so many telescope tourists i suppose i will have to move thereor chileor the mongolian steppe probably best to wait on that until i have fully committed to the hobby
space,not_removed,thats not bfr the bfr is the booster this is the mct or its bfr is big fucking rocket mct is marsinterplanetary colonial transporter
space,not_removed,no solar panels and you are too far from the sun for them to work anyway so what powers the lights we see in the windows
space,not_removed,he really should give the its a proper class name it is a real ship after all built to go anywhere in the solar system not just move bits of itself to a predetermined location and come back as one tiny piece of what left how about naming the first one the constitution that way its a constitutionclass ship hell name it after von braun goddard or call it an aresclass ship just give it a real name
space,not_removed,probably my least favorite part of the presentation the its plan answers questions of cosmic radiation and microgravity health issues by getting to mars faster from burning ungodly amounts of fuel then they show this moon which is a year journey away not to mention a photo of the thing landed in one of the most severe radiation environments we know where computers cant survive as a total afterthought
space,not_removed,i am no scientist but if the rocket landed on ice with extreme heat producing boosters wouldnt it make a sinking hole or something thereby messing up the landing
space,not_removed,the renders werent too good up close enceladus and europa would not be so flat
space,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters used in this commentbig fu falcon rocket used in this commentinterplanetary transport system see mct used in this commentmars colonial transporter see its im a bot and i first saw this thread at sep utc httpwwwdecronymxyz httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
space,not_removed,both the booster and the lander are part of the its spacex has not yet given separate names to the two vehicles bfr and mct were both working names that no longer seem to be in use
space,not_removed,i love that they called it bfr
space,not_removed,its also spacexs rocket not elons
space,not_removed,dont forget to take your ten ton radioactive strontium cargo it will keep you hot and powered for a long time
space,not_removed,if only this ship thing had something in it to combust in a generator
space,not_removed,wishes and dreams and plutonium edit how funny would it be if they sent astronauts on a mission like this and made them power the vehicle with bicycle generators its like an alaskan washing machine except a bit further away
space,not_removed,radioisotope thermal generators fuel cells i dont know
space,not_removed,he said the version he unveiled is just its future versions will be bigger have better engines and if were gonna be buzzing around the solar system well have access to lunar so it will probably be fusion powered one day
space,not_removed,elon has been considering hearth of gold as the name of the first ship
space,not_removed,i agree would a proper class moniker quite
space,not_removed,enceladus is not in a particularly severe radiation environment youre thinking of europa but still a sound point about the scope of such a journey no way a mars ship gets to saturn without some attached nuclear reactor and people would go mad in such a confined space for years it would need to merely be one part of a much larger complex spaceship and rotational gravity would be an absolute necessity
space,not_removed,sinking hole not likely its possible it would alter the ground enough to make landing tricky ice on celestial bodies is so cold though that its as hard as rock my spacecraft design team calculated than an mmrtg pumping out of heat as much as the average space heater could melt europas surface ice but really slowly like meter per day
space,not_removed,i would expect that any molten ice is directly blown away if it exists as liquid at all which requires some pressure from the rocket exhaust you reduce the amount of ice a bit where you land but probably not enough to be relevant
space,not_removed,surface gravity on enceladus is only about of g so you could cut the engines from a significant height and just drift down
space,not_removed,true the community made up a good naming scheme and elon sort of fucked it i think we should just call it bfr and ct then can call the hole architecture its
space,not_removed,im not an engineer but just looking at it the landing gear could have been designed to give greater stability even with advanced propulsion and gyroscopes it could have been made to naturally be more stable
space,not_removed,guess who the ceo of spacex is
space,not_removed,given that spacex is elons thats not a very useful distinction
space,not_removed,it will need all its fuel for propulsioni doubt they would burn any of it for power its almost certainly supposed to use either a retractable solar panel system or a nuclear reactor for electricity
space,not_removed,it has to do the opposite use electricity to produce fuel
space,not_removed,and use the power from the bicycle generators to make food because fuck thermodynamics
space,not_removed,rtgs are too low in power for supporting human crews they typically output a few hundred watts and you need more like several kwperson for life support fuel cells consume fuel which wont last the years needed to reach saturn for outer planet missions with people the only reasonable answers are a fission reactor which would need to be on an extended boom to reduce radiation levels or very large reflectors which can be thin aluminized kapton to concentrate sunlight onto solar cells
space,not_removed,well have access to lunar sigh i wish people would stop repeating this myth there are about parts per billion on the lunar surface there is actually a couple thousand times more and nearly a thousand times as much therefore you would need to mine a thousand times less ore to get nuclear fuel however uranium and thorium are not that scarce on earth and its probably easier to just bring them from here if you have a need for that means you have solved fusion the reaction is low radiation but it is not the easiest fusion reaction to do most likely dt fusion will be solved first if you have fusion power for your ships you can go to httpsenwikipediaorgwikineptuneatmosphere and mine its atmosphere from orbit with a scoop why neptune its atmosphere is helium and therefore parts per million six thousand times the lunar concentration the remainder of what you scoop up can be used as propellant both for making up the scoop drag and for the return trip so mining neptune can be selfsustaining going to neptune is harder than going to the moon but not times harder and not if you have fusion power for your ships so from the moon is a lost cause as far as nearterm missions probably fission reactors are the better choice for missions beyond the asteroid belt we know how to build those their radiation can be handled by placing them on a strut away from the crew with a shadow shield on the side facing the crew module you dont care about radiation that escapes in the other directions since space in general has a lot of radiation you will need shielding for the crew anyway so the reactor shield only needs to be good enough to bring the level down to the general space level
space,not_removed,i kind of suspect that by the time were using fusion power like that the its will be an antique
space,not_removed,its heart of gold after the ship from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy suitable especially since the booster has engines
space,not_removed,a picture with ict on europa was also shown during the presentation
space,not_removed,like said i was referring to europa they might as well have put up a billboard for vacations on io
space,not_removed,yeah given the height of the whole thing the legs doesnt look spread far out enough for nice stable landing though my experience with rocket science is limited to kerbal space program so i might be wrong
space,not_removed,so its the tim cook iphone and sundar pichai android not quite as catchy my point was that this ship so far has taken tens of thousands of personhours of intense effort and the collaboration between other companies and agencies to attribute it to one guy because he was the one calling the shots at the top is a bit silly elon also owns only of spacex based on most estimations so the company isnt really his either edit i cant find any decent sources on this though one website says both and so who knows nothing about it is public though
space,not_removed,not to mention the fact that fusion requires hotter temperatures than dt fusion and peaks at a lower fusion rate
space,not_removed,for an uncultured like me what is the deal with number
space,not_removed,its steves iphone tim cook didnt start the company
space,not_removed,also the density of on the lunar regolith is approximately the energy density of peat seriously this mining business needs to taken out back and shot
space,not_removed,in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy which is actually a set of books about a fictional hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and one of its authors there is a project to find out the answer to life the universe and everything and a computer system aliens create does find that answer it is only problem is they dont know what the actual question is since they didnt specify that they wanted the question and the answer so they get the computer to try to figure out the question but some other things happen and the project is derailed so this is why is mentioned a lot it is the answer to life the universe and everything one thing that i find interesting is that the character in ascii is character number is used as a wildcard in queries and programming somehow the computer in the books finding the answer is might be just that it returned ascii character which means basically anythingeverything
space,not_removed,steves iphone
space,not_removed,indeed there are plenty of realistic resources to get from the moon we dont have to focus on the one that has the advantage of sounding like science fiction
space,not_removed,i believe its because a is the designation of the primary star in a system always the first planet would be a b a companion star would be b etc the only designation of a should be the star itself
space,not_removed,i stand corrected thanks udastardlydan
space,not_removed,thats what the capital letters are for i dont think thats the answer
space,not_removed,udastardlydan is right its a complicated and shitty system you can read more about it httpsenwikipediaorgwikiexoplanetnamingconvention
space,not_removed,okay thanks for the link i agree it seems needlessly complex
space,not_removed,no it was not reused they launched new falcons everytime but now they used an previously landed falcon again reuse this wanted space x to do today they achieved it
space,not_removed,the landing and recovery part was necessary to reuse rockets but this is the first time they actually did reuse it previous ones were taken apart and analyzed to make sure there was no damage done in the first launch and to generally refine the system next up is making the turnaround time shorter and cheaper
space,not_removed,both most of what you see is stars in the milky way but some galaxies are visible notably the magellanic clouds and andromeda galaxy but these are hard to see with the naked eye but it is possible
space,not_removed,most likely stars as most things arent visible to the human eye also what youre seeing is a delay due to the speed of light for example you see sunlight around minutes in the past when youre looking at the sun
space,not_removed,do all these stars have planets
space,not_removed,i thought the andromeda galaxy was the only one visible to the naked eye
space,not_removed,to be clear by some you mean three or four
space,not_removed,how long does our suns light take to reach pluto
space,not_removed,i heard a talk by steven vogel at ucsc hes a planet hunter he said stars not having planets are probably the exception
space,not_removed,theoretically a lot if them should
space,not_removed,yes some is a nonspecific i know of three but couodnt remember for certain if there were a few more or not hence nonspecific edit this may come as a shock but i answered without google having looked it up now i can say this first result answered op should have used the search engine
space,not_removed,between about and hours as plutos orbit is quite elliptical
space,not_removed,a little bit longer than it takes to illuminate uranus
space,not_removed,that is crazy to think about
space,not_removed,not loght hours just regular hours a light hour is a measurement of distance not a measurement of how long light takes to get somewhere
space,not_removed,perfect just what i was looking for
space,not_removed,compare with a taken into space
space,not_removed,this is cool i remember going through the physics of this in physics class back in the day i dont recall the reason though note that when it flips the rotation continues the same direction from our pov which means it changes direction from the pov of the handle so guessing if the handle were perfectly symmetrical the mass were centered perfectly on the axis of spin would it still flip consider if the handle had another extension on the other side so it was crossshaped symmetrical in all dimensions it would probably not flip the center of mass would then be in the center of the object as it is the center of mass is somewhere toward the end of the screw part so it may be that any slight wobble due to imperfection is quickly amplified as that part gets farther off center until the whole thing is rotating on the wrong axis through the handle part but that is also unstable so it continues to the alternate configuration rinse repeat we are used to thinking of rotation in two dimensions with the third constrained conservation of momentum is the key i think
space,not_removed,its called the dzhannibekov effect i think it is essentially when a rotating object has an offset center of mass and is only stable in axis of rotation and not the third
space,not_removed,bit more info on the ultra black spray paint here
space,not_removed,heres a link
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,were most likely to kill each other than by any other natural phenomenon
space,not_removed,where would our energy come from whatever the source depletion of source would be the end
space,not_removed,you used the word likely which strictly means high probability of occuring the sun is likely to die at some point since all energy comes from the sun at some point this should lead to death assuming humans have something they need to survive and were only ignoring social based options all other scenarios have a less than probability of occurring but are nonnegligible
space,not_removed,sure but in the billion years until the sun stops there is a possibility that we could relocate to another solar system so the suns death does not mean ours
space,not_removed,true we need more assumptions
space,not_removed,very broadly and oversimplified the camera will take images one each with red blue and green filters then they are colored and combined its possible to do it yourself with photoshop or similar program and httpwwwplanetaryorgexplorespacetopicsspaceimagingtutorialrgbpshtml
space,not_removed,very broadly and oversimplified the camera will take images one each with red blue and green filters then they are colored and combined in which case the resulting images would be truecolor not false color that op refers to but likewise filterssensors can be used to capture parts of the spectrum not visible to the human eye infrared ultraviolet xray gamma and in order to make those visible colors visible to the human eye have to be assigned to that data in that case it would be falsecolor images
space,not_removed,this is really misleading caves has been running for years and its not some kind of deep space isolation experiment or experience like nasas yearlong isolation experiment caves is more about teamwork leadership decisionmaking conducting simple scientific experiments darkness etc its a part of most esa astronauts training i think
space,not_removed,whats the point of using a cave couldnt you simply build a simulated space station inside a lab and lock them in it other than the isolation from other people caves and spacecraft dont have a whole lot in common
space,not_removed,this is a great idea but less than a week not sure how much that helps when we are talking months and years of space travel
space,not_removed,instead of testing astronauts to see how well they will fare in isolation why not pick people who naturally lead isolated lives and train them to be astronauts
space,not_removed,then they will be placed under a large dyson to experience the vacuum
space,not_removed,its an interesting idea but without any mynocks i dont know how true to space it will be
space,not_removed,thanks op half of the comments about this is nothing like a space station because you linked an article that completely miss the point of the actual exercise
space,not_removed,this is how horror movies become based off true events is that what they want a horror movie script
space,not_removed,is it me or are all these isolation experiments a bit silly i have a disabled neighbor and im convinced that she hasnt left her apartment in years she appears to be able to deal with it and there will be many more like her hidden from sight let a home care service ask their clients to contact them and theyll get all the data they can handle
space,not_removed,it would have been cheaper to send them to se oregon more isolated too
space,not_removed,i was thinking they arent isolated at all if they are on twitter but then i remembered that the iss has internet access too
space,not_removed,they should just send them to a kmart you can go months without seeing anybody in there
space,not_removed,one of said astronauts is my exscience teacher mr arnold absolute baller sorry about never doing my homework
space,not_removed,another sign esa is in decline a cave is not space space is up in the sky a cave is underground at least the price is right doesnt cost much to live in a cave s
space,not_removed,cool im going camping too no cell reception on the campground no problem
space,not_removed,cant they take ipads and stuff like that to space and people live their lives in boxes anyway i really dont see the isolation thing as that big of a deal i guess they have to test them just in case
space,not_removed,sounds like a nice plot to the descent cant wait for them to encounter the chupacabras
space,not_removed,i think the very first twilight zone episode was this exact premise except with one guy who goes insane
space,not_removed,this headline was really exciting for the first seven words or so i wanted to learn about esas sixseat crewed spacecraft oh and what happens to british astronauts postbrexit
space,not_removed,i hope they produce a httpsenwikipediaorgwikicantuatenore album while theyre down there and they could compose lyrics on the theme of space
space,not_removed,sounds like teamwork camp for astronauts it looks fun and interesting but should we be spending taxpayer money on it does it have a tangible benefit

space,not_removed,truly groundbreaking im sure this amazing training will come in handy when the european space agency sends its first mission to the moon in the year
space,not_removed,why dont they just send them to my room if they really want to experience isolation
space,not_removed,i was watching hestons space food and they showed the astronauts in this excersize a few of them seemed to be joking around and enjoying the challenge of it which is really cool nasa clearly chooses people who have iron hard joy
space,not_removed,why would you have to go into a cave though in sardinia there are lots of places where you can experience isolation i went to visit a friend who lived a few kilometers out of town and it was so absolutely quiet at his house i found it hard to stay awake
space,not_removed,geeze the uks been out of the eu for less than a week and europe doesnt know which way is up
space,not_removed,europe is never going to the moon or mars they will be lucky if there ever is european manned orbital flights africa is never going to the moon or mars south america is never going to the moon or mars australia is never going to the moon or mars canada is never going to the moon or mars get a grip on reality for a change this guy is gone but he was probably honest about his opinion from a european pessimistic view if you think you cant do it then you probably cant no way to live outside earth space colonization a myth esa director
space,not_removed,six astronauts isolation
space,not_removed,im pretty sure all nasa trained astronauts do an antarctic expedition
space,not_removed,dont you feel they kind of shoehorned that acronym into existence caves — cooperative adventure for valuing and exercising
space,not_removed,is there public spelunking in those caves they look cool
space,not_removed,no flashlights
space,not_removed,true plus if they really wanted them to experience the isolation of space they could do it far easier by dropping them off at some random area of nebraska
space,not_removed,both have a small chance of killing you by crushing asphyxiation starvation if they go deep enough in the cave its like nobody can help them if they get trapped space simulation isnt the same without the tiny random chance of getting abandoned and dying slowly
space,not_removed,they do its called hera and its at johnson space center
space,not_removed,why build one when you already have a cave
space,not_removed,its that type of thinking that got you elected
space,not_removed,were talking about the same agency that just held a fashion show
space,not_removed,youd be surprised how different things feel after one week in isolation and the dark i spent two weeks last year at the mdrs as part of a mars sim and its pretty crazy how quickly your brain adjusts to new long term stressors
space,not_removed,because its not just about isolation its also about team building and cooperation people who live isolated lives do not tend to be the same people who want to work together with other people
space,not_removed,theyre not making a sequel to armageddon
space,not_removed,instead of astronauts learning to drill why dont we get drillers to be astronauts
space,not_removed,are you suggesting sardinian astronauts im ready
space,not_removed,i could totally be a space hermit
space,not_removed,it reminds me of the movie sanctum even without coming across any monsters getting trapped in a cave is pretty terrifying
space,not_removed,internet doesnt really work that well with ping times on the order of minutes not hearing sounds except for those close by can be a little weird
space,not_removed,russian cosmonauts did an isolation test for over days as a an experiment for a round trip to mars i believe surprisingly no real adverse psychological harm
space,not_removed,ive heard that some nasa astronauts get to do nols expeditions
space,not_removed,that describes every other nasa or us military acronym though they really like to make them relevant words
space,not_removed,technically its a httpsenwikipediaorgwikibackronym
space,not_removed,the point is that even in the most dire circumstances you would still know in the back of your mind that you are just inside a box in a simulated situation the cave adds that psychological element of being very far from any real help
space,not_removed,but thats nasa bit more experience under their belt
space,not_removed,because caves arent particularly similar to spaceships
space,not_removed,fashion like space travel is all about taking risks
space,not_removed,whats the problem with doing outreach and getting people interested in space exploration its not like they threw all their efforts towards the fashion show instead of doing science and research just supported the thing done by some students why not
space,not_removed,a very politically correct fashion show i hope
space,not_removed,also you need an engineering degree and some time in the army usually
space,not_removed,bullshit i thrive being isolated i also work very well on a team the two are not mutually exclusive
space,not_removed,minutes not unless you plan on going to mars
space,not_removed,nasa and roscosmos are both excellent at selecting astrocosmonauts with the right personality traits to work and live in these environments a few space mutinies made sure they got that squared away
space,not_removed,«the experiment ended in acrimony after a canadian woman complained of being forcibly kissed by a russian team captain following a fist fight between two russian crew members that left blood splattered on the walls»
space,not_removed,i watched something last night on the science channel about the mars experiment and they found that of them had some pretty large behavioral problems and were completely fine im not sure about long term effects but still interesting also something really interesting that i didnt think about that the same show mentioned spaces deepest secrets was that you may get someone who will experience psychological effects if they are rather athletic and enjoy the outdoors as opposed to someone who enjoys reading watching movies and being inside more
space,not_removed,maybe it was because they knew they were still on earth and could be potentially rescued
space,not_removed,not in the true spirit of acronyms if you want to name it something name it
space,not_removed,caves are not really dangerous especially a cave where research is being done a room would suffice but i imagine cost plus accounting is the real reason and week lame
space,not_removed,its about being in a harsh landscape while working cooperatively with a team and coping with the environment astronauts are already trained to be in spaceships
space,not_removed,thats not the purpose of this experiment
space,not_removed,if some aspiring fashion designer decides to put their efforts towards human progress instead of human vanity then i think the effort it probably worth it its about getting people to think about space who normally wouldnt
space,not_removed,i think wed all rather land on mars in style though
space,not_removed,unless it has sexy ladies on it
space,not_removed,degree in the sciences is it not and arent many astronauts civilians
space,not_removed,except you would be in the opposite situation you would have zero privacy or alone time yet be isolated from pretty much all the support structures we have on earth
space,not_removed,well youre not an astronaut innit
space,not_removed,its not isolation its more like being a small band of foragers again the kind of mentality you need for that is different to the kind of mentality a person who lives by himself may have i am not saying people who love isolation cannot enjoy it but itll be more like living as a small tribe of humans
space,not_removed,hes taking about people who purposely live alone in the woods not your cubicle office job
space,not_removed,mars would have a min ping time there and back and the moon would have a ping time of around second ping time before anything goes through routers on earth you could probably add on an extra seconds for that depending on where the signal reaches earth and what equipment its running through
space,not_removed,im pretty sure they only pick perfect people
space,not_removed,were there really space mutinies
space,not_removed,huh didnt know they did one in but probably i shouldnt say no adverse effects some were diagnosed with mild depression and at least one was having chronic sleeping issues but its not nearly as bad as one may presume do you have a link to that earlier study sounds like it didnt go as well
space,not_removed,yea as i search more on it now i shouldnt say no adverse effects some were diagnosed with mild depression and at least one was having chronic sleeping issues that is really interesting but it makes sense that an introvert would do better in isolation
space,not_removed,im sorry you what
space,not_removed,youre possibly not talking about the cheyenne mountain complex are you im actually scared asking this question hell the us government is probably unto me now
space,not_removed,caves are incredibly dangerous the darkness makes slips and trips even more likely theres very real risk of it flooding and causing you to drown add to that wildlife collapses etc its certainly not the safest activity to do
space,not_removed,stem natural sciences and medicine are all valid fields for the degree and yes most mission specialists are civilians its the mission commanders who must have hours pilotincommand of a fast jet test pilot experience which is of course only really available through military service
space,not_removed,think members of the shakleton expedition they worked well together because they had a common high goal they were not the type of men who needed nonisolated lives
space,not_removed,my theory is that theyre all robots built by the nazis and sent to the future to build the nazi moon base™
space,not_removed,apollo and skylab missions i believe one of the mir crews had problems the apollo and skylab crews were overscheduled and the apollo crew was sick schirra had postnasal drip which can be sheer misery in zerog because it doesnt drain
space,not_removed,archer is basically a documentary
space,not_removed,there are fouled servers in the deep places of the world
space,not_removed,the easiest way to build a bomb shelter that will take a direct hit from a nuke is to build it insideunder a mountain
space,not_removed,is on to you man better get the tinfoil
space,not_removed,cheyenne mountain is so well known there are signs pointing the way
space,not_removed,reasearch cave we are not talking about an unmapped system here we are not talking about a rescue operation that could take weeks but one that would take an hour
space,not_removed,astronauts must be the most well rounded people in the world peak physical and mental condition psychologically well adjusted bsc minimum really at least a masters if not phd for mission specialists mission specialists are generally expected to be one of the top or one of the most promising scientistsengineersdoctors in their chosen field as well pilots are very experienced fighter pilots in the military generally expected to have experimental test pilot experience as well and these are just minimum requirements to apply they go up against thousands of other candidates for a couple of places getting in is like a stamp to say your insanely talented
space,not_removed,they had the forethought to trademark it too
space,not_removed,can someone please provide more info on this im not to lazy to look it up its just that google doesnt work on my computer
space,not_removed,but none of those are mutinies
space,not_removed,well my dreams of being an astronaut are now dead i have a constant nasal drip that no matter how many drugs and steroids they put me on it does nothing and people think i am joking when i say is happens
space,not_removed,one man the last hirens boot cd and no localadmin rights coming this summer pebkac bwwoooooommmm
space,not_removed,we mustnt speak of the servers of the deeps
space,not_removed,google maps is this is this a verb now
space,not_removed,hah i was too scared to go underground in literally any fallout game especially nv i got up to the part where you have to help jason and his ghoul gang go into space when i heard i had to go underneath the facility i noped out the game as fast as i could i finally got back to the game and finished that quest this year
space,not_removed,ive always wanted to watch stargate but i never knew where to begin watching it it always peaked my interest
space,not_removed,i know but you know the whole opsec thing with security cant say specifics etc
space,not_removed,even mapped systems are still inherently dangerous
space,not_removed,thats why it rings like a bell
space,not_removed,all three astronauts developed head colds during their almost days in space approximately hours into the flight schirra developed a bad cold and cunningham and eisele soon followed suit in the weightlessness of space mucus accumulates filing the nasal passages and does not drain from the head the only relief is to blow hard which is painful to the eardrums several days before the mission ended they began to worry about wearing their suit helmets during reentry which would prevent them from blowing their noses the buildup of pressure might burst their eardrums mission control tried to persuade them to wear the helmets anyway but schirra was adamant they each took a decongestant actifed an hour before reentry and made it through the acceleration zone without any problems with their ears after orbits over days and hours they landed on october in the atlantic ocean and were recovered by the uss essex quote from how i found it httpimgurcomaexpch
space,not_removed,a recent episode of the podcast voices from talked about this it was an episode about space psychology great podcast in general
space,not_removed,the space mission definition of mutiny covers much more tame behavior than the earthbound one sure they didnt commandeer the craft and fly away with it but journalists have repeatedly used the mword albeit with a touch of irony for decades in regards to the incidents on apollo and skylab that was the sense of the word used in the above post which im adopting for the sake of clarity i didnt design the english language i just use it the six astronauts involved in those missions never flew in space again mission control took defiance of their authority very seriously
space,not_removed,im not sure that being an astronaut is enjoyable prestigious sure the fitness requirements entail multiple hours of exercise each day most of the earthbound work is bureaucratic games and missions are stuffed with endless hours of dull tedious work whether or not youre doubled over with spacesickness i think nasa started pulling phd physicists etc in the because it was an easy way to narrow down the field to people who are highly motivated status conscious and can concentrate for long periods of time but what theyre concentrating on is not necessarily interesting the views from the office on the of your days youre actually in space really kick ass though
space,not_removed,i would see that especially if it cast samuel l jackson nicholas cage would be a good choice as well
space,not_removed,what new router is this
space,not_removed,learn to english we verb everything
space,not_removed,you can verb anything if you do it with enough confidence
space,not_removed,ive always wanted to watch stargate but i never knew where to begin watching it
space,not_removed,are you dedicated to it start with the movie then watch the shows in sequential order of when they were released not dedicated to it watch the movie and the premiere of season if youre not dedicated to it by then you wont be seasons and are good but theyre not great
space,not_removed,opsec would include not even describing as much as op did there are probably only a handful of places in the world that match that description and looking at his post history we can tell its military likely in or around maryland as he has recently looked for camping information opsec blown straight out of the window beware the breadcrumbs
space,not_removed,love the how i found it essentially lmgtfycom
space,not_removed,nice one the how i found it part was just as interesting as what was found
space,not_removed,makes sense i see no reason why any of these crews would want to not fly away with it as it would lead to the deaths of all on board
space,not_removed,ill confidence you in a minute if you dont watch out how did i do
space,not_removed,i have yet to pick up cant say im looking forwards to it it looks more bleak and depressing than nv does i seriously cant stand playing games and having to go in cramped and compressed areas that are especially underground like the vaults irl im fine with it but if it comes in games its a big nope for me
space,not_removed,thank you well appreciated
space,not_removed,also are there any horror themes to it cant really stand horror at all
space,not_removed,if i find it really interesting ill probably end up binge watching it same thing happened with person of interest got really into it binged all the seasons in a couple days into stopped for awhile then i binged again this year now ive finished it i have nothing else to do but if sg gets my attention atleast itll keep me occupied for awhile
space,not_removed,found the security manager
space,not_removed,ooooh mdpa has the awesome site r ravenrock mountain that i got to visit as a kid as part of a family day thing
space,not_removed,technically it would be persec would it not in reference to his own person
space,not_removed,theres not a lot of scary stuff in the sense of things jumping out and going boo or suspensefilled moments however the whole premise of the goauld is of a parasite that takes over your body dont know if you consider that horror stargate atlantis has wraiths which are basically space vampires
space,not_removed,shit time to delete this account
space,not_removed,i would consider it slightly horror since i also cant stand zombieparasite stuff heh i remember one star wars the clone wars episode where an entire ship gets infected by these worm like parasites and that already scared me still willing to give sg a shot however sounds fun
space,not_removed,that is a good video but this one is my favorite no special effects used httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvanucholaw
space,not_removed,i think saturn is the most interesting planet in our solar system not only because of the rings but also because of the hexagon on the aurora which is always beautiful also on earth one question the aurora on saturn looked like it was of a light blueishwhite color on earth the aurora is more greenish is this because of the images by saturn taken in some other spectrum or are they really in another color
space,not_removed,its light years away we need faster than light speed space travel if we want to explore these places
space,not_removed,or sacrifice a generation or two who would live and die on the craft to further mankind
space,not_removed,no we dont just very significant fractions of c
space,not_removed,i think you mean generations at least even at light speed travel we would need generations to reach it
space,not_removed,honestly id go on the craft and be the generation that gets sacrificed thats still a lifetime going through space
space,not_removed,imagine enough generations are born and die on the ship that they start believing their mission and actually arriving at a destination are a myth
space,not_removed,no you dont the closer you get to c the more time dilation you experience tack on enough decimal points to your c and you can get there as fast as you want no ftl required of course on earth years have passed and your family is dead so theres that
space,not_removed,but you wouldve been born on the craft living your whole life in an area of just a few hundred square feet with the same small group of people around you and you wouldnt have had a choice it could go south rather quickly
space,not_removed,but we arent capable of that we are talking about now
space,not_removed,we could get up to maybe double digit percentages of c using a nuclear impulse drive like the orion design but yea regardless were not capable of generation ships now either so no trips for you
space,not_removed,with any luck welcome to a new era of space travel and exploration spacex did an amazing job this is beyond impressive congratulations to all involved edit landed and suddenly prepares self i love glitches
space,not_removed,just saw elon on tv give a little speech he looked so proud was getting emotional they fucking did it congrats spacex
space,not_removed,update update update image update update update update update
space,not_removed,just got back from watching this launch it was the highlight of our orlando vacation everyone agreed it was our favorite park and event kids grandparents spouse and i all stood with mouths agape for that matter so did everyone around us the sound wave reaching us the cheering from everyone there it was amazing just so rad
space,not_removed,i wonder if they will also be able to recover the fairing hope so
space,not_removed,they are cheering like crazy its like mars here we go
space,not_removed,saw it live just now saw hidden figures last night elons method ftw
space,not_removed,this has been an emotional rollercoaster couple of years from to amos to reuse well fucking done
space,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters last usageinterplanetary transport system see mct httpsenwikipediaorgwikiintegratedtrussstructure mctmars colonial transporter see its rtlsreturn to launch site last usageunited launch alliance lockheedboeing joint venture eventdatedescription last full thrust dragon cargo first daytime rtls last full thrust dragon cargo rtls landing acronyms in this thread has acronyms httpdecronymxyz httpsredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
space,not_removed,any word on whether or not they will continue to reuse this rocket
space,not_removed,as the rocket revisits the landing pad the words of course i still love you show their true meaning
space,not_removed,they just use a fisheye to make the earth look round right
space,not_removed,i was so bummed that video cut out hopefully theyll post the recording soon
space,not_removed,see you on mars
space,not_removed,so good to see him after a landing wish i was in that control room
space,not_removed,do you happen to know where i could see this speech online
space,not_removed,one second there was nothing on the droneship the next second bam in your face
space,not_removed,i bet nasa is ecstatic fucking incredible
space,not_removed,bhai ne kar dikahaya
space,not_removed,the did recover them
space,not_removed,they always do most of them worked on it must be an incredible feeling
space,not_removed,i doubt it thats still quite far away were like the way there falcon heavy launches for the first time this summer and i doubt theyve even started actual work on their mars transporter the immediate effects of this are probably lower launch costs for satellite launches in another months or so sorry i just hate running other peoples optimism but facts trump all theyre cheering i just doubt for mars
space,not_removed,elon told reporters he plans to offer this one to cape canaveral as a display piece because of its historical value
space,not_removed,not this specific piece as already stated next to my comments but for the other seven landed stages they expect to launch each another five times
space,not_removed,heres some landing footage from a previous mission to hold you over
space,not_removed,anyone who wants to put up a satellite must be prices will go down
space,not_removed,ula not so much
space,not_removed,why does the live feed always cut out when the rocket lands because the booster thrust shakes the living shit out of everything and the satellite uplink is lost
space,not_removed,yes there have been a few of them but the most recent example is the mission httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvginhaezvpi happens around the minute mark
space,not_removed,heres a view of the rocket landing on the drone ship its pretty awesome since you can tilt around to view it coming down
space,not_removed,the fairings cost a piece from what ive read but its more that the manufacturing process takes up so much floor space that it slows production
space,not_removed,not true the fairing are several million dollars and are the size of a school bus and can take mach aerodynamic pressures it is extremely big and light and would not be significantly hard to recover they intended to try this launch might get some cool footage if it worked i think they mounted gopros inside the fairings
space,not_removed,without the rocket reuse the its is a paper dream with rocket reuse spacex can continue to reduce thier costs increasing profit while capturing more of the market increased profitablity allows them to reinvest more money into falcon heavy and satellite internet all of which can generate even more profit which can be in turn further reinvested into its while the goal of travel to mars is still far off this is one of the foundational successes that it will be built on
space,not_removed,i mean i know the timelines it was just an exaggeration
space,not_removed,they have actually started work development and testing on the main fuel tank for the its its still years away but its actually being developed and tested
space,not_removed,yep i agree with you
space,not_removed,fascinating does anyone have an idea what is responsible for creating the different ice plains
space,not_removed,venus i do believe mars should be in that ballpark too but venus has been particularly bright the past few weeks
space,not_removed,the evening star is venus both venus and the moon are in line and showing the reflected brightness of the sun
space,not_removed,its venus and mars is above venus and a little to the left its a little dimmer tho
space,not_removed,i was looking at this earlier in midland it was shining so bright
space,not_removed,the only celestial objects that cast enough light on earth to produce a shadow are the sun the moon and venus
space,not_removed,i think thats mars were seeing up and to the left of venus isnt it
space,not_removed,its just a pixel or two in this picture but yes
space,not_removed,try httpenspaceengineorg its a program for windows pc but its mindblowing and will answer your questions and more
space,not_removed,my favourite httpwwwstellariumorg httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomnoctuasoftwarestellariumhlen
space,not_removed,hmmm im not sure how involved or complex you are looking for but you might check out the nasas eyes on the solar system httpseyesnasagov
space,not_removed,tell them to close their eyes tightly and picture a basketball then club them over the head with a heavy object
space,not_removed,turn the question around ask him why he thinks the poles are cold and the equator hot why hurricanes spin clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern why the moon and sun are visibly round does he think theyre discs why the sun rises hours earlier in new york than la why are you friends with this person just curious how long does he think it takes to fly from japan to russia im curious how someone can deliberately retain this level of ignorance not reallyi know many religious folk
space,not_removed,if the earth was flat then you wouldnt be able to see stars on the horizon because the mountains would get in the way
space,not_removed,i wouldnt their belief isnt rooted in facts so more facts arent likely to persuade them httpswwwscientificamericancomarticlehowtoconvincesomeonewhenfactsfail there are lots of well documented problems with trying to out fact weird fringe ideas like flat earth like the backfire effect where given good strong evidence against a view people will double down on their beliefs rather than change them in flat earth world facts are things you memorize in school instead of thinking for yourself anything you could possibly say would be met with youre just told that you havent seen if for yourself kind of rhetoric i often hear from flat earth show me a simple experiment one with tools i have around the house dont use any fancy maths and show me the earth is round the problem is you cant do that the earth is round but also quite large so the curvature in any one spot is in fact very hard to measure with simple tools like string and rulers the earth does indeed look flat so what can you do just try to be good and nice to them and empathize with living in a world that is often subtle and hard to understand
space,not_removed,are you sure your friend isnt just messing with you im pretty sure theyre just messing with you most flatearthers are anyway has he considered how satellites stay in space orbits only work if youre orbiting a roughly round object the key to orbiting is going so fast the arc in which you fall is as big as the planet so you continually miss it as youre falling down something flat would be impossible to orbit and you can look up at night and see satellites passing overhead so you cant say satellites arent real
space,not_removed,i would not even try to provide any proof but i would ask him for his proof if you make a claim then you should be able to support that argument so if it is flat he can tell you where the edge is and what is beyond it and justify things like the sun appearing each day dont convince it is round have him convince you that it is flat the only thing that will then be flat is him on his face when he fails
space,not_removed,honestly why does it matter what they believe the most likely reason your friend is asserting this opinion is to suck people into contrarian arguments best thing you can do is let them believe what they want to believe and spend your time on more interesting things
space,not_removed,a low budget school project can get a camera high enough up with a balloon to show that flat earths are crap scam can be falsified by year colds
space,not_removed,take your friend stargazing and look at any moonplanet their spherical shape is the best way to distribute mass evenly ask him why would earth be any other shape blow a bubble in his face ask him if he believes the bubble is flat
space,not_removed,lay on the ground and watch the sun set then quickly stand up you will see the sun set twice because the curvature of the earth
space,not_removed,go to top of a hill overlooking ocean on a sunny day you can see the curvature of the earth
space,not_removed,if theyre so skeptical of facts that they think the world is flat theyve got some other issues going on in their life
space,not_removed,give that friend a yardstick call someone you know of that lives far away if you can and have them hold a yardstick have both friends measure the distance of their shadow from their yardsticks standing straight up or just take a picture with their cell phones only a curved surface will give two sufficiently different lengths for a shadow of a similar object given the light source is very far away which the sun is or better yet find the ratio of shadow to yardstick for each and take it from there
space,not_removed,ignore the scamming attention seeking troll for how worthless and useless he chooses to be by his actions
space,not_removed,id call him a fucking idiot and walk away these people are fucking idiots
space,not_removed,well first they have to admit that they might be wrong and then be willing to accept evidence that disproves a flat earth
space,not_removed,i like the kansas city shuffle better while everyones looking left you go right snaps neck
space,not_removed,and why the moon is upside down in australia compared to the northern hemisphere
space,not_removed,so what can you do on the other hand what he should do is find a better friend
space,not_removed,amazing someone would reject math i guess they dont pay bills
space,not_removed,flat earthers are a real phenomenon i call it such because its unbelievable how someone can believe in such a thing with all the proof in the world proving a round earthsmh some people man
space,not_removed,if the orbit is sufficiently distant the geometry of the mass its orbiting becomes irrelevant like a distant planet orbiting the center of mass of a close binary star system or if you want something roughly flat the globular clusters in orbit around the milky way galaxy though of course this breaks down with close orbits like most of our satellites have not a flat earther
space,not_removed,flat earthers definitely exist its like a religion you even see atheist being caught up in it its crazy
space,not_removed,here comes the pseudoscience by eric dubay thatll they regurgitate
space,not_removed,i personally find the flat earth belief egregious and offensive because its a complete dismissal of science and o cant be friends with someone that has no respect for science
space,not_removed,actually that test would work on a flat earth too because triangles
space,not_removed,yes good point i was referring to low earth orbit satellites though which are the ones visible at night
space,not_removed,im not an idealogue i dont pick my friends based on their beliefs
space,not_removed,explain how triangles would make a flat surface look round
space,not_removed,what about racism or nationalism we reject ideologues all the time if someone is telling you fuck science these people vote they are trying to make our world worse by dismissing science i cant be friends with someone that wants to degenerate the human condition based on a belief
space,not_removed,it wouldnt but it would allow two sunrises when you increased your elevation and could therefore see over the lip over a flat edge o o
space,not_removed,httpesamultimediaesaintmultimediavirtualtouriss is a virtual tour is a pdf of the components httpsyoutubeqvtmdihynes is a minute tour
space,not_removed,that pdf is old the has more information than you could possibly want
space,not_removed,thank you
space,not_removed,will they make a vr working experiencetour for it
space,not_removed,awesome thanks for sharing
space,not_removed,given how far away venus is from the sun this really gives some perspective on how huge the sun actually is venus is the body closest to earth in size dayum space you big
space,not_removed,this terrifies me and to think the sun is small compared to other stars
space,not_removed,im excited because it feels like we are almost in the video era of space exploration in the beginning we only got pictures but now after the use of timlapse and capturing events as they happen i can finally see those stills animated into a much more comprehensive and graspable perspective
space,not_removed,its amazing to think that men spent years of their lives and not a few died recording the transit of venus in and here we can just watch it in hirez with the click of a mouse and im not even wearing pants ref
space,not_removed,said this before and this really makes it sink inwere so damn small
space,not_removed,over what period of time is this video captured would it be right to say that this would be half of venus orbital period any good sources for reading up about the transit
space,not_removed,why wont imgur gifs load anymore i am sorry if this isnt the right place to ask but its so frustrating
space,not_removed,i thought this was a mistake and the gif actually showed mercury if this really is venus then i really have a problem with scales if i imagine i would stand on the surface and would look up the whole sky should be filled with the sun
space,not_removed,this video was taken from where venus orbit
space,not_removed,favoriting the youtube video for my astronomy students were just now talking about heliophysics and that is an amazing cut also obligatory damn space you awesome
space,not_removed,check out sunshine great movie that conveys the sheer terror of being close to the sun
space,not_removed,thats a common misconception gigantic stars are exceptionally rare most of the stars in the night sky visible with the naked eye are larger than average because they are also the brightest but out of nearest stars all but alpha centauri sirius and procyon are smaller than the sun
space,not_removed,not even close next transit visible from earth will be in
space,not_removed,it was about eight hours iirc maybe a few more or less but definitely around there
space,not_removed,why half of the orbital period the sun doesnt take up half of the sky it takes venus just a few hours to cross an entire disk
space,not_removed,no it wouldnt the sun would have an apparent radius about larger venus is times as far from the sun as we are to it sothe sun would appear times as large its a trick of perspective the two bodies are almost seen to scale here venus is a bit less than times as large as it should be compared to the sun but it doesnt tell you anything about the apparent size of the sun from venus
space,not_removed,it was taken from orbit around earth
space,not_removed,nasa has a few solar observations in space i am on my phone and about to start work google around and you should find the website which escapes my mind now where you can watch the sun live plus find out where they are located to give you some ideaone of them is on the other side of the sun from earth
space,not_removed,i believe this is the shadow of venus over the sun which is why it appears so close to the star
space,not_removed,im taking an astronomy class this winter what level class is it that you teach
space,not_removed,one of my favorite films the shot of them looking at mercury crossing the sun in front of their viewing room was absolutely amazing
space,not_removed,thats fair my wife tells me average is enough
space,not_removed,depending how you count it you can make the case that the sun is small average or large if you look up the average mass of all stars that exist today its less than one solar mass so the sun must be large right if you compare the sun to the largest stars its tiny less than of them so the sun is tiny in comparison if you look at the mass weighted average of the stars ie if you took a random piece of a star what kind of star is it most likely to be from its pretty much solar mass so the sun is average
space,not_removed,yes i realise what a silly question that was what we see is a small part of the suns surface not an entire hemisphere
space,not_removed,its a trick i tend to fall for good explanation thanks
space,not_removed,when youre looking directly at the sun where do you think sunlight is coming from this is seeing venus directly its also seeing venuss shadow directly but thats a natural consequence of looking at venus pass in front of the sun
space,not_removed,this is a ken m worthy comment
space,not_removed,please don t delete this comment out of shame wear it proudly like a scarlet letter at the rate things are going you could be nominated to be director of nasa
space,not_removed,how the fuck do you get the light to cast the shadow onto the sun
space,not_removed,it seems to be too defined to be a shadow but even the sun appears to be too big you cant film venus being too close to the sun if you want to have a so big image of it i mean or you film a big sun and miss venus or you film a smaller sun and include venus
space,not_removed,point taken not my highest caliber thought early morning
space,not_removed,you do understand that you cant get a shadow on the sunright
space,not_removed,on the bright side you might have a healthy karma career at rshittyaskscience in the future
space,not_removed,something i hope to strive for with my shit to the brain certification
space,not_removed,this is what happens when you speak out of uranus 🌚
space,not_removed,but did get hit by a similar sized asteroid a few years ago its the one that exploded in russia
space,not_removed,we really need a demonstration mission on mars getting water from the underground ice so many ideas depend on that
space,not_removed,is there any realistic ways to terraform mars how to overcome lack of magnetic field
space,not_removed,we are all grown ups here the actual future of mars
space,not_removed,how come most terraformed depictions of mars only have an ocean in the northern hemisphere isnt there a significant amount of water at the southern pole
space,not_removed,i dont fault people for using their imaginations to dream of possibilities and such for extending life beyond our planet but sometimes i feel like we as humans have our priorities all over the place we have a perfectly good planet right beneath our feet that we and the rest of the livingnonliving organisms that inhabit it have become adapted to for long stretches of time the sun and earth give us literally everything we need to survive without expecting anything in return and what do we do burn harmful petrochemicals releasing them into the atmosphere ravage the natural world for finite resources destroy ecosystems through huntingfishingfarming dump harmful by products back into the environment and continue to take up more and more of everything while doing little to protect what we do haveeducate people about the natural world not to mention as a species we have yet to learn how to coexist with each other and the natural world around us its all very sad but maybe that is the central fallacy of mankind we have all the ability and insight into becoming stewards of a world that we can collectively manage for the advancement of our lives and all living creatures around us yet we allow greed and commerce to dictate how we live just offering my own insight into these areas
space,not_removed,correction that is what mars will look like after we crash europa into it
space,not_removed,ive been playing an app called terragenesis where you terraform planets like this its early days i think its just one guy working on it but it has great potential took me a week to terraform the moon but looked pretty cool afterwards
space,not_removed,not sure if it would look this warm the temperature would still be mars temperatures at least to some degree no pun intended but now that i see it pun intended
space,not_removed,mars is like earths back up incase anything really bad happens what could possibly go wrong on this blissful planet to make us want to leave rhetorical sarcasm blast off
space,not_removed,a perhaps possible future for mars this would also require humans not to destroy themselves in the next few thousand years an increasingly unlikely possibility
space,not_removed,if its true the planets are moving away from the sun this image would represent the past right
space,not_removed,so which planets make the most sense to mush together so there is enough mass the resulting blob of debris can eventually be called a habitable planet with a magnetic field
space,not_removed,im not gonna lie im pretty dumb when it comes to this stuff however to terraform mars would require intense carbon convertors reactors ora lot of plants right
space,not_removed,how does mars very weak magnetosphere play into this wouldnt one solar flare wipe all of this progress out
space,not_removed,isnt that the past of mars from a few billion years ago when it had liquid water and an atmosphere
space,not_removed,if we ever have the means to terraform mars i sincerely hope we have a thorough understanding of its geologic or potential fossil record before destroying it
space,not_removed,i think that by the time we get good enough at manipulating comets and asteroids to terraform mars we wont be worried about catastrophic asteroids anymore
space,not_removed,i think that if we are through the great filter we will have the tech to do this relatively soon in the scale of history saying we will be able to do this in not of years i still believe though that utilizing habitats possibly out of hollowed out asteroids and kuiper belt objects is more likely saying that if you could have httpsenwikipediaorgwikiterrariumspacehabitat or oneill cylinders spread through the system with populations of like minded societies of of thousands socialists yellow dog democrats new england republicans trumpsists etc living in small towns in living breathing ecosystems of the caribbean islands african savanah rain forest north american precontact plains you can put your energy into creating these societies with gravity of earth and radiation free or you can put your energy into a place that humans animals and plants will always need genetic modifications to thrive in the radiation probably and gravity certainly not to say these pictures arent cool and exciting they are
space,not_removed,we could take big chunks of ceres and smash it into the pole overcome the lack of mag field by ignoring it
space,not_removed,people like to fantasise about it but if we want to be realistic mars wont be terraformed the amount of effort you would have to put in to maintain a hospitable environment is incredibly huge and would be absolutely impossible to achieve for a very long time until we have the technological advancements to make it theoretically possible it will already be much easier to just find and go to another more suitable exoplanet
space,not_removed,the lack of magnetic field strips away the atmosphere and gives long lived complex organisms cancer but it takes millions of years for the atmosphere to be stripped away so if we could build one quickly hundreds to thousands of years then who cares about what happens in millions of years the cancer is a problem but only for humans really if we can terraform mars hopefully we can cure cancer as well
space,not_removed,all you need is energy bombard the southern pole with energy say a couple thousands of orbiting space mirrors the goal is to turn that frozen and release it into the atmosphere this starts a positive feedback loop the more is released the hotter it gets which in turn releases more from pure frozen sources but also from stored in the ground
space,not_removed,can we make artificial magnetic field
space,not_removed,im friends with the pi of maven and he says no way can we terraform it ill take his word on this
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,is there any realistic ways to terraform mars a few thousand years of hype and pretty pictures
space,not_removed,are you saying mars is going to undergo mitosis
space,not_removed,what makes you think that a large scale terraforming of mars will never happen
space,not_removed,since were all grown ups here the reverse order of op picture is the future of earth
space,not_removed,the northern hemisphere has a much lower elevation compared to the southern meaning all the water would flow to that direction
space,not_removed,europa is kinda far away maybe ceres
space,not_removed,theres plenty of water on mars not sure why it would need even more than earth
space,not_removed,deleted
space,not_removed,there are various methods we could use that may only require centuries once introduced especially if combined like introducing ammonia and extremophile organisms
space,not_removed,neither of them if you want it before the human race dies out but probably mars and europa and youd have to do it so that the resulting armagedddonblob moved closer to the sun than it is currently
space,not_removed,over a few million years yes this is why im not a fan of terraforming it unless we can create an artificial magnetic field
space,not_removed,everyone is talking about manipulating comets and asteroids on this post did i miss something
space,not_removed,or use chunks of mars moons phobos and deimos there is plenty of material and potential energy to raise the pressure and temperature of mars certainly enough to raise the pressure high enough to walk around without a pressure suit
space,not_removed,its really not much more far fetched than space elevators or fusion rockets a century or two off yes but not impossible technology i dont think it would take that much effort either just patience it really only comes down to one problem surface pressure increase the green house gasses slowly melt the poles and liquid water will return to the surface of mars along with a pressure this is plenty for life slightly uncomfortable for humans but nothing supplemental oxygen wont fix we know theres plenty of water near the surface of mars and some of it is even liquid engineer a bacteria to live in this environment and poop or any good green house gas and let it loose on the surface if a starting colony of bacteria covers square meter of mars and doubles in size every week then it will cover the entire surface in a year without competition for resources whats to stop it
space,not_removed,until we have the technological advancements to make it theoretically possible it will already be much easier to just find and go to another more suitable exoplanet if you can successfully get a human population to an exoplanet you can terraform mars first
space,not_removed,i think its doable with near future tech to have an earth like atmospheric pressure on the surface the atmosphere of mars will have to be higherthicker than earths we need about quadrillion tons of nitrogen and quadrillion tons of waterice this thicker atmosphere will greatly help reduce radiation that hits the surface and also retain more heat we just need a lot of frozen nitrogen and water luckily for us the kupier belt is full of frozen nirtogenwater iceballs pluto would be a great source of raw materials its all there for the taking robotic mining units could be sent to plutokbos and railgun launch large chucks of this ice at mars for centuries this would gradually add more atmosphere as the frozen projectiles evaporated on entry gradually adding energy and pressure literally all we need is nitrogen water ice the is there its going to happen
space,not_removed,but if they could do it leaving almost all spiders all crocodiles alligators and my ex behind id vote for it
space,not_removed,also an atmosphere itself is the primary thing that protects us from radiation
space,not_removed,the magnetic field doesnt actually do much as far as radiation shielding is concerned anything it would have redirected would have been stopped cold by the atmosphere
space,not_removed,of earths atmosphere is nitrogen we also need to import a lot of nitrogen from the kuiper belt luckily theres a lot of frozen nitrogen in the kuiper belt
space,not_removed,nope even if we vaporized all the carbon dioxide at the martian poles we still wouldnt have a decent atmosphere plus a mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere is toxic
space,not_removed,we really dont need one we need massive amounts of nitrogen and water it just so happens that the kuiper belt is full of objects composed of just that
space,not_removed,i think thats photosynthesis s
space,not_removed,the requisite technology to terraform mars moving enough mass to bring up the surface gravity and add a breathable atmosphere implies that we can just build purposemade environments or leave the solar system the latter two options are easier than terraforming mars
space,not_removed,i guess its better than nothing but europa would be large enough to leave mars with a sizable moon for tidal forces to power a molten core
space,not_removed,theres plenty of water on mars not sure why it would need even more than earth mars currently has much less water than earth
space,not_removed,whats really lacking is not water or it lacks nitrogen as a neutral filler gas to get that you really need to go far out not even the inner asteroid belt is far enough out to keep nitrogen ceres would do but we are very far from being able to transfer a lot of mass from ceres to mars i am in the camp of building habitats in space instead of terraforming mars but we can use mars with all its local resources to learn building autonomous habitats before we move out
space,not_removed,no mars about earths distance from the sun sunlight intensity scales with inverse square of distance from sun so it receives less than half the insolation
space,not_removed,because the truth is we cant change either at a rate fast enough to save our asses unless we get a very early warning
space,not_removed,the real fun would be to place bacteria on the planet and watch what happens to life on a planet different to earth how it responded over time please ignore the fact that its near impossible to terraform mars because its not if we have about million years to spare but neither will happen because nasa and most of the world agrees we are not to touch the planet until we prove there is no life on it at all even the rovers can not go into areas at risk of disturbing this life my true dream in life is to be around when we find aliens or an at least a species outside of earth highly possible its there but even more unlikely we will find it sadly but there is no chance unless we look so we should all focus on that
space,not_removed,because were changing mars under the current circumstances of mars not having biosphere that can collapse earth currently requires its biosphere to remain healthy thats far harder to maintain with current levels of consumption than to begin building small but permanent settlements on mars
space,not_removed,well you want the collision to be as slow as possible so actually having the smaller planet moon get eatenshredded by the gravity of the planet would be best nothing can go wrong when mucking with substantial gravitational solar system forces right
space,not_removed,mars doesnt have enough frozen volatiles to give an atmosphere therefore volatiles would need to be brought in importing volatiles via asteroid and comet impacts is a common mars terraforming scheme perhaps the most high profile example of this is kim stanley robinsons mars trilogy in robinsons fiction mars atmosphere is beefed up by retrieving kuiper belt objects and crashing them into mars surface
space,not_removed,i am biased for using ceres becsuse my mentor wrote a paper on sending water from ceres to mars
space,not_removed,mars atmosphere is already mostly already the problem is the density is far too low for any greenhouse effect you cant just throw bacteria at this problem you need to add the missing atmospheric gases and a great deal of mass to get surface pressure up to livable levels
space,not_removed,not sure if this makes sense but do you think there would be a way for us to take greenhouse gasses from venus and transfer them to mars maybe we could terraform them both at the same time im not sure what the atmosphere on venus is comprised of and if they would be useful for this purpose
space,not_removed,its really not much more far fetched than space elevators so not at all
space,not_removed,there is a reason why mars has next to no atmosphere and has lost almost all of its liquid water chances are mars has looked very different billions of years ago more like we would want to terraform it to today but the conditions have lead the result we see now the challenges to overcome the lack of a magnetic field and shortage of gravity etc are immense and it certainly wont be done just by melting the ice at the poles if the status quo has become the balanced state over all this time to create a new balanced state wed have to manipulate the conditions themselves drastically to do that artificially and to maintain the atmosphere without it escaping to space within a few years the measures wed have to take are so much bigger and more difficult
space,not_removed,well the first goal would be to thicken the atmosphere its a lot easier to release stored in the ground and frozen deposits than to manually bring nitrogen from the asteroid belt the first goal is to increase the pressure so that plantsalgae dont need a pressurized habitat so that they could start generating oxygen importing nitrogen isnt really a priority in fact youd probably rather have to help warm up the planet and allow for liquid water on the surface
space,not_removed,you realize we dont need to replicate the earths atmosphere right we just need enough atmospheric pressure so that we dont require pressure suits on the surface and the surface temperature is higher near the equator humans only require about of earths sea level atmospheric pressure
space,not_removed,where did you get your estimate from theres enough to reasonably get to atm through fairly conventional methods
space,not_removed,why is more gravity needed its not
space,not_removed,it doesnt need more mass it is still able to hold a breathable atmosphere for around a million years
space,not_removed,building habitable space stations is multiple orders of magnitude more difficult than slamming some asteroids into mars poles we could even slam chunks of one of the moons into the poles until we get the atmosphere we desire there is more than enough material in the moons to do this we only need a pressure high enough to not boil our blood if we can raise the pressure to the armstrong limit and raise the temperature a bit pressure and temp go hand in hand raise one and you raise the other then we will be able to go outside with just an oxygen mask and a warm coat this will allow us to colonize and eventually terraform mars much more easily if industry can become profitable on mars pollution would actually be a good thing on mars well some of it industry can become profitable on mars if we can get an influx of people who need material goods or if we find valuable resources on mars that are close enough to the surface to easily mine for and then export back to earth maybe platinum or something i dont know what the mineral resources look like on the surface not sure anyone does yet it would make sense for mars to be rich in the same resources we find in asteroids since mars has not been geologically active for a while it has not eaten the resources on the surface and sent them to the bowels of the core like earth does we can create an influx of people to mars by providing affordable and reliable transport via solutions resembling musks mars colonial transport we can create the desire to go to mars by offering people similar benefits that we offered settlers in the us to colonize the west eg free land on mars you settle it you own it this is all doable in our lifetimes provided we dont fuck ourselves too hard politically this stuff isnt even that hard in an engineering sense it is just expensive and politically difficult
space,not_removed,others have already explained why those two examples are not the same another important difference is with mars the atmosphere can only get better we cannot upset some delicate balance because there is none also unlike earth mars doesnt have several billion people that might get angry if you started dropping comets on them the biggest problem i have with this analogy is that youre comparing something we cannot do today with something we wont even be trying to do for several hundred years we need a bit more time before we can truly say whether the idea is feasible or not
space,not_removed,crashing europa into mars would give it much more water than earth
space,not_removed,there is an enormous amount of water already on mars there is no need to use ceres phobos and deimos are enough for a decent atmosphere
space,not_removed,keep dropping ice asteroids into it
space,not_removed,once weve figured out how to create and control wormholes we may as well just use one to get to an already habitable planet
space,not_removed,the atmosphere was stripped away of many tens of millions of years of weathering from solar wind if a atmosphere appeared on mars tomorrow it would stay there for millions of years humans dont have to care about such long time lines
space,not_removed,plants need nitrogen and pressure just as much as they need
space,not_removed,so lets say plants convert the mostly atmosphere into that would reduce thickness of atmosphere by about and it is doubtful theres enough in the first place plus a mostly atmosphere is a very bad idea the nitrogen would not only be needed to reduce flammability but it is also necessary for life as others on this thread have noted
space,not_removed,where did you get your estimate from i show my math at heres enough to reasonably get to atm do you have a cite for your or is that wishful thinking on your part
space,not_removed,theres enough to reasonably get to atm i dont think so the estimates ive heard are that all that ice would only double the atmosphere to around that of earth we need a shitton of nitrogen its all nitrogen these days
space,not_removed,deleted
space,not_removed,in fact it is gravity and metals present in a planets core are what keep an atmosphere in place without them an atmosphere like mars will let liquid water evaporate and get thinner and thinner until the maximum gravity of said planet can support it
space,not_removed,tens of millions of years according to current estimates of how long it took to strip mars atmosphere the first time
space,not_removed,and terraforming it will take thousands by the time its done a million years wont seem like such a long time its such an incredibly naive desire you want to make another planet just like the one were currently shitting up but the time scale that it requires has only two outcomes extinction or something akin to the singularity where we either have total mastery of our biology or we have artificial life or both and this desire to have a blue sky and breathe air and walk on grass but on a different planet will be seen as a childish desire and a monumental waste of resources that could be going toward projects that would actually advance the inscrutable goals of the conglomerate of nearly immortal and incomprehensibly intelligent entities that will be the descendants of ourselves and our machines
space,not_removed,same is true with ceres earth doesnt have much water
space,not_removed,using an asteroids volatiles where they sit would give much more real estate see
space,not_removed,sure but you dont need the martian atmosphere to be nitrogen transporting that much nitrogen to mars is a monumental task a couple orders of magnitude more difficult and costly than releasing stored already on mars increasing levels is infinitely more important if you are going to go to the asteroid belt for resources its going to be for heavy metals and ice
space,not_removed,so lets say plants convert the mostly atmosphere into why are we saying we want this we want the martian atmosphere to have a lot of to help warm the planet and allow for liquid water on the surface also consider that it took billions of years for all of the oxygensinks on earth filled up and gas could accumulate in the atmosphere in significant levels realistically were simply going to be trying to increase martian oxygen levels as much as we can its going to be a fraction of a percent of the atmosphere for a very long time theres no danger of accumulating too much oxygen nitrogen would not only be needed to reduce flammability but it is also necessary for life actually of the martian atmosphere is nitrogenargon and odds are there is plenty of nitrogen in the soil in the form of nitrates because mars and earth both share a lot of the same elements in their formation costly missions to the asteroid belt dont make sense when the resource is on mars in abundant quantities
space,not_removed,i took zubrins estimate i remembered it as but his optimistic estimate was up to which is still good enough but his estimate doesnt involve any large scale digging lets assume you have a sizable industrial capability on mars and you have a trillion dollars to spend terraforming would you get more by sending thousandsmillions of missions to the asteroid field and bringing nitrogen back or extracting it from the soil or deep below the ground which would also yield other useful resources barring extreme advances in propulsion youre better off mining but once you get to atm thats good enough for plants to thrive its a reasonable goal with a reasonable timeframe and while youd probably still enclose your crops to keep moistureoxygen and other resources contained and controlled you wouldnt need clunky airlock systems and thats the defining metric for how large a human population you can sustain available crop yield
space,not_removed,though mars atmosphere currently is rather thin most researchers believe that there are enough reserves of carbon dioxide on the planet to substantially thicken it some of this carbon dioxide exists in frozen form as dry ice and makes up the south polar cap additional reserves are trapped within its regolith the loose surface material that overlays the planet regolith is an astrogeologists term for dirt and applies to any planetary body soil refers to earths regolith releasing all of this carbon dioxide would greatly thicken the atmosphere possibly to the point where its pressure would be about percent that of earth or mbar almost onethird of a bar heating the planet will cause these vast reservoirs of trapped carbon dioxide to emerge this zubrin robert case for mars kindle locations free press kindle edition so up to not as i remembered
space,not_removed,actually mars can hold a breathable atmosphere for around a million years and its the lack of a magnetic field thats the main reason it will eventually get stripped away
space,not_removed,wrong mars can hold an earth like atmosphere for millions of years
space,not_removed,projects that would actually advance the inscrutable goals of the conglomerate of nearly immortal and incomprehensibly intelligent entities that will be the descendants of ourselves and our machines id like to think that cavemen were similarly awestruck by us their descendants a hundred thousand years hence whose goals would be unimaginably far beyond just hunting mammoth to live they wouldnt have believed that eating mcdonalds while looking at cat pictures is pretty much the high point of our collective lives
space,not_removed,orbital habs are by far the most realistic idea for offworld habitation in the near to mid future
space,not_removed,i agree also if you live on planets and want to go anywhere else you have to escape the gravity well through costly rocket launches or building a space elevator not to mention the danger though relatively small of impactors from space orbital habs do much to mitigate such problems
space,not_removed,eventually you do need the martian atmosphere to be nitrogen thats true terraforming heavier gasses would displace oxygen at ground level and suffocate the surface sure ill give you that it may not be the first thing but its one of the highest priorities and is completely doable thanks to the kuiper belt there may well be plenty of nitrogen available in the minerals and we could allow plants to do their thing nad release this nitrogen but no matter what were going to need kbo nitrogen to create the high atmosphere we need on mars remember since gravity is lower the new mars atmosphere will have to extend farther out into space in order to achieve the same surface pressure as earth i think this is ultimately a very good thing as the thicker higher atmosphere will both retain more heat and block more radiation
space,not_removed,why are we saying we want this itd be nice to have a breathable atmosphere
space,not_removed,thats excellent if true but seems to be a very optimistic estimate i hope its accurate
space,not_removed,sorry zubrins wishful thinking isnt a credible cite
space,not_removed,thats raises solar radiation as a huge problem
space,not_removed,deleted
space,not_removed,sounds pretty good since humans have been around for only a couple hundred thousand years
space,not_removed,deleted
space,not_removed,but with a planet you have a much more stable system
space,not_removed,yea lets just build orbital station so we can build spaceships in space but ow wait all the materials you will need to build anything will come from earth so you not only will not save anything but you will lose out hugely
space,not_removed,i still dont see how it would be considered a high priority terraforming mars would take many thousands if not millions of years releasing is the easiest and cheapest way to get pressure and heat into the atmosphere which then leads to sustaining plant life which allows for oxygen generation which takes time humans will still have to go outside in suits for all these thousands of years importing enough nitrogen to be able to go outside without a suit would be thousands of times more difficult than previous terraforming it would involve billions of launches to the asteroid field the demand for heavy metals would completely eclipse the demand for nitrogen
space,not_removed,something dropping from the kuiper belt would hit mars anywhere from kms to kms depending on what angle to the mars orbital plane the incoming comet has if a comet strikes with enough energy it can blast away all the atmosphere above the tangent plane at point of impact this known as httpsenwikipediaorgwikiatmosphericescapeimpacterosion so dropping kbos on mars could even subtract from mars atmosphere
space,not_removed,sure it would but getting the martian atmosphere to be a copy of earths atmosphere would require a huge mastery of energy and technology its not a practical goal for it to be breathable it would need to be warmer the warmer it gets the more will be released above and its toxic which means youd be sequestering huge amounts of which is whats helping warm them atmospheresurface much more realistic goal to accept high levels and work with what you have so you can have liquid water and some oxygen in a reasonable time frame with known technology
space,not_removed,the atmosphere does most of that shielding too it mostly just needs more atmosphere
space,not_removed,not really the decay isnt remotely relevant in human timescales and the current surface dosage right now is pretty low
space,not_removed,mars can hold an earth like atmosphere for millions of years even with its low gravity losing the atmosphere we build to solar winds isnt a problem
space,not_removed,true but habs can be put on solar orbits and the like pretty easily
space,not_removed,you would mine asteroids and comets for those materials of course lifting everything up from a planet would completely negate the benefits of living off planet
space,not_removed,ok i disagree i think harvesting nitrogen ice from the kuiper belt and rail gun launching chucks at mars using entirely antonymous robotic mining units would be relatively easy in the scheme of things and provide its own benefits in retaining heat and blocking radiation which i agree are very important
space,not_removed,so it sounds like youre wanting a mars less hospitable to humans a toxic atmosphere if you have lots of anaerobic bacteria it will be toxic and smell like shit with a thicker atmosphere weather is more of a problem a near vacuum is much easier to deal with than a winds at earth pressure and an atmosphere makes mars ascent more difficult presently ascending kilometers will get you in atmosphere thin enough to do the major orbital burn beefing mars atmosphere to earth density would likely jack that up to a kilometers
space,not_removed,deleted
space,not_removed,mining asteroids wont be cheaper for very long time
space,not_removed,im not saying its not an eventual goal but it would be among the last things to do if your goal is to increase the buffer gas content of the atmosphere it is much much easier to dig into the ground and release whatever is stored in there nitrogen and argon probably missions to the asteroid belt are costly they would be for pure unoxidized heavy metals humanity would only start importing nitrogen from the belt when all other resources are in excess
space,not_removed,i think its the easiest shortterm option you could start after a couple centuries and kickstart a nice positive feedback loop if it takes of the timeeffort to do compared to moving worldly amounts of nitrogen might as well by the time its finished technologyinfrastructure might have advanced quickly enough that importing unimaginable quantities of nitrogen isnt as difficult of a feat weather is more of a problem true for an unrepairable rover but humanity has dealt with wind for our entire existence odds are a lot of living space would be underground anyway and an atmosphere makes mars ascent more difficult yeah but you can make fuel using the atmosphere using the atmosphere to brake would make descent less difficultcostly not a bad tradeoff when youre getting stuff delivered from earth send hydrogen from earth or just get it from water sources
space,not_removed,why do you think more gravity is needed mars used to have an earth like atmosphere in the past and we dont even need one we just need about to be comfortable assuming theres enough oxygen potentially less with a simple breathing mask
space,not_removed,to put it straight mars does not need more gravity to contain an atmosphere similar to earths httpsenwikipediaorgwikiatmosphereofmarshistory at one time mars had enormous oceans and warm weather additionally a magnetosphere is not required to maintain a planetary atmosphere over short periods of time millions of years if we can create an atmosphere on mars we will not need to replenish it for thousands or hundreds of thousands of years also the atmosphere largely filters solar radiation so we really do not need a magnetosphere for anything except i suppose for compasses but there are other ways to derive heading gps solar positioning etc please see or
space,not_removed,its probably closer than being able to terraform mars
space,not_removed,what intelligence there is out there may have not noticed us the odds of them surviving them selves is vary slim producing intelligent machines as an evolution of them selves those machines would likely have little interest to go past their own homes machines may have no desire to reproduce past their own limited resources observation nothing conclusion we know what alien machines are thinking
space,not_removed,there is a possibility that life on other planets has evolved past the point of comprehension to us humans a species so advanced that we dont recognize that its life
space,not_removed,they left a while back they realized that if they left asap theyd make it out of the galaxy before andromeda collided with us that or maybe theyve evolved to a point where they realize that interfering with our evolution could adversely effect their existence andor ours so they intentionally hide from us you know like on star trek
space,not_removed,there are other possibilites such as they may be entrenched in extreme religiosity noticing physics based phenomena but attributing them to spirits gods perhaps even enabling them to travel in space but regarding other beinfs they meet as demonsangels the like this hasnt seemee to occur to anyone yet which is puzzling
space,not_removed,we can say there is no point for a post organic life form to contacts other organics in a stellar economy but we humans study ants and even try to communicate with them just for research i dont think time is a problem for a machine it could probe all the galaxy and add our specy to its list of life forms encoutered just that if we are curious beings i dont know why a machine couldnt
space,not_removed,personally i think that intelligent life is very very rare in the universe life maybe not so but sentient life certainly if you look at the only case study we have earth youll see that life has existed for a majority of earths history however even the earliest humans only evolved within the last few million years that seems like a long time but life on earth has existed for a few billion years i would wager that there are certainly plenty of earthlike habitable planets which would have life but a very small number of themif any at all would have intelligent sentient life communication is a completely different set of circumstances as well we make a lot of assumptions about how alien races might communicate but theres no way of knowing if those assumptions are correct save for a successful communication with another civilization how do we know the other species has eyes or ears for example and so dont use visuals or sound to communicate how do we know that they arent using some other form of communication that we havent discovered yet how do we know they even want to communicate at all i think it requires a very specific set of circumstances including timing before we can successfully communicate with another civilization assuming another one exists at all
space,not_removed,in the bigger picture weve covered a very small amount of time and space
space,not_removed,i think you took a small hypothesis and blew it up without much basis but hey science says go for it because who knows either way when you look at the massiveness of space and the extreme span of time that has passed and will pass i think its more likely signals will take too long to reach other species maybe if you live in a happenin galaxy with multiple places for life you can meet some aliens but chances for that are slim and even then we may not even see their signal for hundreds of thousands of years just think if we see alien life through a telescope theres a high probability that they are long gone because we could see billions of years into the past editspelling
space,not_removed,carl sagan discusses this at great length inshit dragons of eden i believe pretty sure it was that book might have been somehthing else he wrote though but you cant really go wrong witn carl sagan books
space,not_removed,just maybe theres no one out there in a distance that allows communication
space,not_removed,weve landed craft on a whopping other worlds there are something like sextillion stars in the universe with umpteen planets each weve looked on three
space,not_removed,exactly weve partially explored planets other than our own around star of out something like sextillion stars in the universe s clearly weve sampled enough planets to know that only earth holds life and we should stop looking now s
space,not_removed,oh yes the billions of years into the past crock of academia shit whilst we see stars exploding in realtime and get data of planets circling what must be ghost stars quite paradoxical if one pulls their head out of their ass
space,not_removed,whawhaat so according to you the speed of light is instantaneous and black holes are ghost stars
space,not_removed,sure why not sounds far more plausible somehow than the endless conflicting theories we hear in serious publications enough is fucking enough if we believe what they say all there is is blackness out there theres no point to ever exploring a la star trek ie our efforts towards advances in propulsion are pretty much a waste of time yet they pump billions of dollars into it someone is blowing smoke up our asses
space,not_removed,if we believe what they say all there is is blackness out there who is saying this im not aware of any mainstream theory that says that all there is is blackness out there
space,not_removed,astrophysicists are unswerving in the light just now reaching us from stars no longer there bit which if youre able to think critically is the same as saying theres just empty space out there so only every astrophysicist
space,not_removed,i see where you are confused there is plenty out there it just takes time for the light to travel so things have changed since that light started its journey the stars are moving so they are not in the same place as they were when that light started its journey some of those stats may have gone out since that light started its journey some new stars may have formed
space,not_removed,well thats much more of a clarification than any scientist ive asked would deign to put forth so you can see where id gotten the idea perhaps good on ya usually its basically no paradox now go enjoy the physics based gadgets we made possible
space,not_removed,i dont see any need for these two ideas to compete with one another minor differences are there but these two could work together to make something truly fantastic a back up planet is a good idea because no matter how much you protect earth an asteroid a volcano whatever is going to happen having a secondary location to avoid extinction during the fall out is a good idea however earth is our home planet and where we are meant to be it is also beautiful it should be protected in every possible way
space,not_removed,its kinda like those rivalries from the early century again like with edison and tesla its going to be fun watching the competition and a new race for a technological frontier
space,not_removed,mars is a great opportunity for humanity to learn the art of terraforming something that will be crucial to us in the future there will be other planets but mars is in a great position to start
space,not_removed,i completely agree i would love to see the homeworld unmarred by factories and mines i think the moon would be a good place to set up automated industry it has enough gravity for robots to operate its close and we dont have to worry about hurting its nonexistant ecosystem also it would be far easier to redirect asteroids to the moon for processing and recovery than the earth
space,not_removed,that makes sense a backup planet within the same solar system isnt as practical as protecting the main planet since anything that wipes out the planet entirely would likely affect the neighboring planets as well eventually when we move onto other star systems then we can think about backups
space,not_removed,taking the baseline energy use on earth and compounding it at percent for years would require covering the entire surface of the earth in solar cells to meet the demand by the year for a guy whos supposedly making realistic predictions of the future he kind of overlooked the fact that solar cells in years might be a little more efficient than the ones we have in
space,not_removed,frankly both ideas are equally silly mars is a dead end youre just moving from one gravity well to another with all the same problems and more the desire to go there is a remnant of the days when we thought the planet was teeming with life including bikiniclad alien princesses industry is going away to be replaced by custom local manufacturing through printers and the like there are few things that would be worth the shipping cost to send from the moon to anywhere else in the solar system and most of those things will be made locally well before were capable of building factories on the moon in fact id argue that theres no way we can afford to colonize the solar system until we can make most things locally from local materials
space,not_removed,when all you have is rockets that can get to low earth orbit everything looks like it should be in low earth orbit
space,not_removed,i think he is right we should put the idea of a backup planet out of our minds even the big mass extinction events on earth were not as bad as the normal situation on mars our future is determined by how we treat this one planet we have
space,not_removed,its like starting to fly before even starting to walk a pointless discussion for this era maybe another few hundred years but even then the industry will always take the straight line in order to make money they wont take a side road just because
space,not_removed,bezos is right we should move toxic industry to orbit the moon and asteroids streamline energy production to nuclear solar hydro and wind mars isnt going to work for humans as a backup or reserve earth hell venus is better suited at least it has a thick atmosphere
space,not_removed,exactly what planet would we go to even if we could somehow manage to teraform all of fucking mars its a tiny planet and the amount of habitable safe land is almost nothing compared to the population of earth
space,not_removed,however earth is our home planet and where we are meant to be for now yesi imagine martians will adapt to their planet as well it is also beautiful to be honest its beautiful because of life it should be protected in every possible way agreedfirst off all we should collect genetic material of species that might go extinct then if we survive they also survive
space,not_removed,i agree i think why not go for both advance space technology where you can have both i can understand bezos idea happening first as its easier but as soon as we have the technology to travel that far i have no doubt we will try
space,not_removed,because no matter how much you protect earth an asteroid a volcano whatever is going to happen when humans are able to place all their industry in orbit dealing with an asteroid or volcano will be trivial matters
space,not_removed,yeah
space,not_removed,also it would be far easier to redirect asteroids to the moon for processing and recovery than the earth also much lesser consequence if the redirection ship messes up and crashes it
space,not_removed,whispers in engineer robots can operate independent of the gravity of an orbital body if theyre designed as such
space,not_removed,i think itd only ever be a backup for the handful of people rich enough or connected enough to get there it seems like for the vast majority of humanity itd be easier to take care of the place we are already at
space,not_removed,also as much as redditors would like to believe mars isnt really a viable backup the planet is much too hostile and some of the fundamental problems reduced gravity cant be engineered away
space,not_removed,first i dont think mars as a backup is a good argument im very very much in favor of colinizing mars but it wont be able to be an autarchy for a very long time second we wont get to other star systems unless we first learn how to colonize the solar system mars is the first step there
space,not_removed,since anything that wipes out the planet entirely would likely affect the neighboring planets as well unless affected would amount to wiped out eggs in two different baskets would still be a lot more secure eventually when we move onto other star systems then we can think about backups if wed have the technology to live on mars why wait with making the continued existence of our species more secure until we have developed interstellar propulsion technology
space,not_removed,solar cannot get more efficient than
space,not_removed,industry is going away i hope you understand how ridiculous this statement is
space,not_removed,the desire to go there is a remnant of the days when we thought the planet was teeming with life including bikiniclad alien princesses also that desire fits with the ongoing manned mars mission boondoggle that nasa is ensnared in
space,not_removed,if you are going to make up things that wipe out multiple planets at least use something plausible like a grb instead of asteroids
space,not_removed,our most destructive industry is food production or it will be until we start trying to haul billions of tons of food and fertilizer up and down from orbit
space,not_removed,venus is not better suited for human habitation when you say something like this i suspect you are perhaps thinking about the so called cloud cities which will be faced with rapid ultrasonic winds and downdrafts along with a constant misty drizzle of sulfuric acid mars on the other hand has everything we need for selfsustained survival including what is likely a sizeable amount of water
space,not_removed,hell venus is better suited at least it has a thick atmosphere it is much harder to deal with heat than with vacuum
space,not_removed,actually unless im mistaken marss surface area is equal to earths total habitable surface area
space,not_removed,to be honest its beautiful because of life but life is here because of incredibly rare and wondrous planetary conditions calm yellow sun the perfect distance away molten metal core to both shield the surface from radiation and drive volcanic processes and an excellent mixture of carbon and volatile elements to get mixed up in those processes a combination of liquid and solid surface coverage a gravity well light enough to let all of these elements mix yet strong enough to keep them from escaping yes we can potentially and theoretically recreate these conditions on other worlds given astronomical amounts of time and effort but there is no denying that our home is naturally beautiful for reasons other than the life that beauty has enabled
space,not_removed,i really fucking hope we have a dna backup of at least a few nowextinct species and most endangered species i know we dont have the tech to do much with that dna right now but the future is bright and who knows we might end up becoming a space faring civilization and use our dna database to seed life throughout the universe
space,not_removed,a devastating event such as this would make collecting resources from earth essentially impossible having mars as a back up gives us a massive pile of resources with an atmosphere you can make propellant out of you wouldnt have that in empty space
space,not_removed,i can see stopping an asteroid but how are humans supposed to stop volcanoeslike the yellowstone supervolcano or prevent megathrust earthquakes
space,not_removed,its simple just use the asteroid to plug the volcano
space,not_removed,edisonmay your name be forever cursed
space,not_removed,first of all i dont think many engineers would appreciate you whispering inside them second while its completely possible for robots to work outside of gravity having some gravity helps immensly in many different ways
space,not_removed,youd think that based on how people talk about backup but honestly people normally completely miss the point of what backup means even musk usually phrases it in a way that causes people to miss the point although his talk of a million man city hints that hes thinking differently backup doesnt mean a bunker full of scientists huddling in the cold on mars caring for some library of alexandria of knowledge you could do that better in a bunker on earth backup is about kickstarting an economy off the earth its about getting a thriving civilization on mars because its relatively easy there and then moving out into even more difficult places to live and building in those places its about making a thriving solar systemwide civilization where earth is perhaps as like the near east plays to urban civilization the place where it all got started first important but just a fraction of the civilized world and one that we could do without in a pinch mars is just a tiny first step on the way to that but its an important first step bezos space industry would also be an important step but in the end for it to happen it wont be just a few rich people population rich and poor in the solar system at large will need to approach or even exceed that of earth you cant think small for a backup but fortunately you dont really have to the hard part is learning to live in space if you can get that down and you hit a tipping point of economic size its going to tend to grow because there are simply so many resources out there to make a living off of
space,not_removed,id argue that reduced gravity is less problematic than a planet that has been completely destroyed no i dont think you have the right thing in mind when you think of a backup its a way to let humanity go on if the earth gets completely screwed over and in that case the reduced gravity isnt your biggest problem its not supposed to be as perfect for humans as the earth is besides this its a driving force for technological advancement and cooperation so theres another advantage so perfect definitely not but it is certainly viable
space,not_removed,we dont know that reduced martian gravity is a problem while we know what happens to humans in and microgravity there have been no longterm tests on g however from what weve been able to observe on earth humans bones develop and retain mass just fine we call em children
space,not_removed,i wont speak to the feasibility of it but the lower gravity absolutely can be engineered away with a centrifuge pbs spacetime does a good bit about it around the mark
space,not_removed,i think the reduced gravity is more of a problem in space than on mars
space,not_removed,some of the fundamental problems reduced gravity cant be engineered away this a hugely open question we know plenty about humans in a fair chunk about humans in zero g we know absolutely nothing about this needs research before any mars plans two capsules with mice in at either end of a long tether would be a relatively cheap start
space,not_removed,mars doesnt really amount to a backup when it comes to space a nova gamma burst etc that hits earth would absolutely wipe out the entire solar system at once obviously theres no reason not to colonize mars so if we reach a point where its efficient to do so the point is that localized threats like asteroid impacts climate etc can be controlled using much more basic technology levels than what it would take to create a self sufficient station or terraform a planet
space,not_removed,its upper atmosphere is actually rather hospitable relative to the rest of the solar system there are already proposals to setup manned blimp bases and stuff
space,not_removed,while life might not begin in a planet like mars i have no doubt that it can adapt and evolve there we dont find the conditions beautiful earth even with its water would be like mars to us if it had no life of course the creatures that can adapt will be limited compared to earth billions of species
space,not_removed,you failed to see my point my point is that when we are so far advanced that we are able to place all of our industry in space we will have no problem dealing with an asteroid or controlling volcanos because we will have the technology to do so the same can be said about colonizing another planet when we are so far advanced that we can colonize a new selfsustaining planet things like asteroids and volcanos are no longer any concern because we will have the technology to deal with that
space,not_removed,a nice feature of orbital factories can be the localized presence of something analogous to gravity atwill spin the stuff that needs it leave the rest in freefall no giant deltav requirement to go down to and up from the moonar surface too
space,not_removed,there is no plausible catastrophe that could make earths environment worse for human survival than mars environment is most plausible catastrophes wouldnt even make the air unbreathable if i had a billion dollars and a genuine concern for extinctionproofing humanity id spend the money on some nice bunkers built right here on earths surface
space,not_removed,in space artificial gravity centrifuges could be easier no friction and easy transit between centrifuges in zerog building a centrifuge on a planet you run into some problems you cant use the simple cylinder shape you cant make them arbitrarily large and friction on loaded bearings drive up energy requirements and repairs transition between centrifuges will be difficult because you have to switch between a rotating and a static reference frame both in gravity look at the carnival to spot possible problems there if reduced gravity is a problem it will be hard to overcome on mars
space,not_removed,or we could just send shortmedium term missions and learn about it that way
space,not_removed,this needs research before any mars plans no it doesnt people will go there and do the research on themselves some will survive some will die this is how exploration has happened throughout history
space,not_removed,a nova gamma burst etc that hits earth would absolutely wipe out the entire solar system at once i suspect that you do know there are other more common threats for which mars would be a backup
space,not_removed,its upper atmosphere is actually rather hospitable except for the minor issue of the sulphuric acid but mostly the almost total lack of acessible resources the problems in keeping position in survivable locations against the wind keeping the blimp afloat more than a few days and that getting out of a gravity well almost as deep as that of earth which requires a rocket of soyuz size
space,not_removed,sounds like a great prison colony because the cloud cities wont be able to grow theres no mining of minerals possible from the atmosphere
space,not_removed,i actually expect that once we start settling in on mars a lot of us are going to find that its conditions alone strike us with the same sort of beauty which begs protection here on earth its a dynamic natural planet with billions of years of geological history and people will be calling it home theyll be using the natural resources of that natural world to survive and hopefully flourishthere will definitely be an environmentalist sentiment toward the adopted home although i imagine it might be tempered by local industry i dont doubt our ability to adapt i just dont think that its the presence of life alone which we find beautiful not to mention that any sort of terraforming which would make mars fully habitable would take centuries during which time the surface still wont be friendly to life at all but i think well still love it for its beauty during that time have you ever read the mars trilogy its a fictional political scifi epic of the first few centuries of martian colonization and one of the largest martian factions throughout the story is a radical enviroanarchist movement known as the reds who believe that the martian wilderness should stay as untouched by humans tampering as possible with nearly all decisions of the movement being informed by the amount of protection their actions will afford the natural planet if mars does get settled en mass i have no doubt this would become a real thing we havent even been there yet and its already clear to us that the martian landscape is astounding
space,not_removed,the ability to prevent catastrophes such as these would represent an almost godlike control over nature it is debatable whether it is even possible to achieve that and even if it were possible to have that level of control over nature it would be very far in the future it would only make sense to have all industry in orbit once the earth has been fully converted into essentially a giant city with resource mining areas until then it would be much easier to produce things on earth than have to fly materials up make stuff then deorbit them to be sent back to earth clearly this is a long time in the future and in the meantime it would be much easier and well within our current understanding of what is possible to attempt to colonise another planet instead
space,not_removed,there is no plausible catastrophe that could make earths environment worse for human survival than mars environment is um crap yes the earth a year after nuclear war probably wouldnt be any worse of an environment than mars but the martians will have built habitats to survive that environment while anyone left alive on earth will be living in a hole in the ground and fighting over the remaining tins of dog food we have to get off earth before someone does something disastrous but mars isnt really any better because its just another planet thats just as vulnerable to such things we need to spread out across the solar system until there are far too many human habitats for any single humancaused disaster to kill us all
space,not_removed,if we want back up and living space going under the southern ice seems a wise move massive shielding and you can go deeper at the poles get deep enough for geothermal power and then use all the proposed mars colony tech
space,not_removed,youre assuming that the only reason to have a backup planet is to protect against extinction say some global disaster happens on earth now earth may be nowhere near as bad as mars at this point but unlike mars earth would have billions of starving humans that we no longer have the capacity to feed having a supposed sanctuary on the same planet would likely end poorly unless you intend to keep its existence a secret in which case good luck getting support for the billions in funding needed to support the operation having a backup planet is usually just mentioned as a convenient bonus to having a mars colony anyway the scientific benefits along with granting access to the asteroid belt are far more convincing reasons to go
space,not_removed,youre talking about the environment in the aftermath though once the catastrophe has abated i dont see a downside to having people on a backup planet who will not die during the catastrophe
space,not_removed,thats orders of magnitude more expensive the thing i proposed could be done for under million we currently have zero knowledge of partial g
space,not_removed,sounds like a great prison colony because the cloud cities wont be able to grow there was a persistent rumour in the that the reason the soviets were so interested in venus was because they were running out of room in the siberian gulags and needed a new place to send their criminals
space,not_removed,i think having industry up in orbit assumes the mining of asteroids for resources
space,not_removed,the ability to prevent catastrophes such as these would represent an almost godlike control over nature it is debatable whether it is even possible to achieve that and even if it were possible to have that level of control over nature it would be very far in the future i think you are overestimating this by a whole lot we will be able to alter courses of asteroids in a couple of decades time its rocket science but its not exactly godlike it would only make sense to have all industry in orbit once the earth has been fully converted into essentially a giant city with resource mining areas until then it would be much easier to produce things on earth than have to fly materials up make stuff then deorbit them to be sent back to earth i didnt say this was a good idea i agree wholeheartedly that its idiotic to constantly go from a gravitywell to space and viceversa i merely stated that when this would be possible things like asteroids and volcanos are no longer a concern clearly this is a long time in the future which it seems that you are actually agreeing with great what is the point that you are trying to make and in the meantime it would be much easier and well within our current understanding of what is possible to attempt to colonise another planet instead colonizing and doing science is one thing creating a selfsustainable colony on another planet is something else entirely and is much more godlike than diverting asteroids but this has nothing to do with my original point
space,not_removed,actually there are plenty of people who already have built habitats suitable for a postnuclearwar environments they have far greater population capacity than a mars base would have too and some of them are quite nice theres been a bit of a renaissance in the bombshelterbuilding industry lately if youre seriously concerned about a nuclear war then youd save many more livesperdollar by building more bunkers instead this is my basic point if youre going to build a colony on mars make sure youre doing it for the right reasons a mars colony is a grand adventure an expansion of human horizons its a lousy fallout shelter trying to sell it to people with that justification is not going to go well
space,not_removed,if a global disaster is weak enough to leave billions of starving humans alive the bunker wasnt really needed for species survival after all especially not if those billions of people have sufficient wherewithal to get to it for you the backup planet thing might be just a convenient bonus but all too often in discussions of space colonization i see people pushing it as the primary benefit of a colony i like the idea of colonization but doing it for the wrong reasons is a bad idea its going to lead to bad allocation of resources and ultimately to a high likelihood of failure
space,not_removed,theres no downside but theres no necessity either my objection is aimed at the argument that we need to colonize mars asap to prevent humanity from going extinct there are plenty of other reasons to plant offworld colonies
space,not_removed,sure but were going to mars either way we didnt do a decade of research on a vomit comet before we did the iss programme why should this be different
space,not_removed,except there arent any asteroids in orbit if you want to go to the effort to mine asteroids you may as well just go to mars which isnt as far away you can slow down for free in the atmosphere and refuel
space,not_removed,we will be able to alter courses of asteroids in a couple of decades time its rocket science but its not exactly godlike exactly which means wackos will then be able to kill all life on earth by lobbing a big asteroid at us
space,not_removed,asteroids arent the only possible disaster we could face though as you say there could be some supervolcano or perhaps a nuclear war there are so many things that could wipe out just the earth and not mars or indeed the other way round when mars is colonised or at least greatly damage civilisation the point is that our ability to counter all potential problems by brute force is a long way off whilst colonisation ie safety in numbers is something we can do today may as well go for the easy option instead of hoping well have thought of and came up with a contingency plan for everything that could go wrong colonising another planet would be far easier than being able to control the inner workings of a whole planet in the case of a volcano and as long as nuclear weapons exist in large numbers on earth there is always the prospect of nuclear war colonisation of mars does not necessarily mean terraforming it that i agree would be a massive undertaking of a similar technical challenge to mitigating the effects of a supervolcano however it seems to be that a selfsustaining colony could still take root on mars albeit enclosed which is much more in line with our current capabilities given the money
space,not_removed,if youre seriously concerned about a nuclear war then youd save many more livesperdollar by building more bunkers instead bunkers dont much help when you starve to death after the tinned food runs out because you never built a selfsufficient food production facility in the bunker and the air filter breaks down and you cant get a replacement because it was made in a factory thats now at the bottom of a radioactive crater to be able to survive the worst things that could happen on earth you need essentially the same technologies as you would for a mars colony
space,not_removed,the bunker wasnt really needed for species survival after all but thats not necessarily what its for if civilization collapses on earth and we revert back to a preindustrial state then we may never get back to our current technology level the easily accessible fossil fuels that kickstarted the industrial revolution just arent their anymore so we might end up stuck with preindustrial technology forever a self sufficient mars colony would serve to protect against this type of disaster
space,not_removed,there are lots of closer than mars some require a lower velocity to reach than the moon
space,not_removed,but its much easier and cheaper to build those technologies here on earth than it is to do it on mars i still dont see how its supposed to be better doing all this on another planet entirely its adding an enormous amount of cost and not gaining any extra capability in the process
space,not_removed,mars doesnt have any fossil fuels either there are alternatives the reason we used fossil fuels during the industrial revolution was because it was the cheapest power source not because it was the only power source
space,not_removed,with the right technology you dont need fossil fuels to maintain an advanced civilization such as a colony on mars but you do need them to create one in the first place there is no way we could have got to where we are today without an initial supply of easily available coal and oil
space,not_removed,thats coming out of her paycheck well have to just pay her on the dollar moving forward
space,not_removed,earth is a cherry tomato well that explains a lot i hate raw tomatoes ugh
space,not_removed,and uranus is the size of an apple hee hee
space,not_removed,theres only way to be certain
space,not_removed,i am fairly certain it would be stable in a orbital resonance with earth that is having an month year instead of its current month year or of its current distance from the sun by keplers third law it is possible that closer orbits are also stable relatively speaking orbits can be hard to analyze very long term stability we are not even sure that mercurys orbit is stable as it is some models suggest jupiter will eventually eject it from the solar system
space,not_removed,not sure if mars is too big but you could try and move it in the or stable httpsenwikipediaorgwikilagrangianpoint how would you find the j of energy needed for the move is another matter
space,not_removed,earths gravity isnt the only issue our solar system has been mostly stable for a couple billion years jupiter is pretty good at stabilizing any deviations from stable but its almost impossible to predict over the long term what would happen if you moved mars too far as i mentioned elsewhere problems are easy problems are hard and problems are almost impossible there are at least massive bodies influencing mars im willing to bet no one can predict the long term year effects of a displacement of mars
space,not_removed,doesnt answer your question but basically its doable but not a good idea easier and safer to just terraform it the best we can where it is without moving it at all
space,not_removed,well its the classic three bears scenario hot warm or coldhow do you like your porridge
space,not_removed,pretty sure those martians are on the nofly list atm so its probably not worth it for now
space,not_removed,some models suggest jupiter will eventually eject it from the solar system ive never heard about this can you link a source to that
space,not_removed,maybe commenting to reiterate orbital resonance is absurdly complicated jupiter and the other gasice giants affect pretty much every orbit in our system so any calculation over years is almost impossible to predict we as physicists are really good at problems not great at problems and terrible at problems an problem calculated over a billion years is pretty much impossible to predict its possible you could magically move mars closer with no ill effects but im willing to bet over a long times scale years we would start to see nonpredicted calculations start to add up in a bad way
space,not_removed,if you build giant planetary thrusters the size of mount everest on the planet it could move just play planetary annihilation to understand
space,not_removed,here is one general source that does a reasonably good job explaining it here is the primary source from the scientific literature
space,not_removed,how about this scenario slamming mars moons into the southern northern poles of mars to jumpstart a greenhouse event then move ceres to become mars moon to stabilize its dramatic wobble and change the angle so its seasonal changes would be minimal what would be the pluses and minuses if this could be done
space,not_removed,how dumb of me i didnt think about that
space,not_removed,pluses habitable planet minuses one ridiculous amount of rocket fuel is gone
space,not_removed,i see no problems with this plan
space,not_removed,ksp logic it just needs more boosters
space,not_removed,so you thought that you would add yet another post related to the same topic well done
space,not_removed,like clockwork theres a spacex landing followed by posts about it followed by a few posts complaining about all the posts
space,not_removed,youre asking redditors to not do what redditors do
space,not_removed,bu how are all the bots supposed to farm karma before being sold
space,not_removed,well it is space related at least its not politics
space,not_removed,this is rspace who the hell else is trying to do anything innovative in the space field
space,not_removed,hell yes this is so exciting if you think of it as a modern day apollo mission that well actually get to see happen live and probably in hd things can only get more awesome from this point on
space,not_removed,we are excited to announce that spacex has been approached to fly two private citizens on a trip around the moon late next year they have already paid a significant deposit to do a moon mission damn i want to be paid a significant deposit to do a moon mission rich i thought i was doing well when i made enough to switch to fuck it lets get brand name condiments
space,not_removed,i hope they pack it full of super hightech cameras like some stereoscopic ones for virtual reality
space,not_removed,if they can launch by dec this means spacex will probably beat nasas sls launch to be the first manned lunar mission since the apollo program
space,not_removed,that will be the first time humans have left low earth orbit in years
space,not_removed,i hope they dont rush this because if these people die it will be a huge setback for the industry
space,not_removed,man i hope i dont suddenly die before this happens i cant wait to see this
space,not_removed,i was about to say the article says not until not next year then i realized it is in fact
space,not_removed,now i dont want to sound wrong here but is that something like a mile high club
space,not_removed,i was a space nerd who grew up in the during the height of the space race i wanted to be an astronaut when i grew up but i had kind of lost interest in the whole thing no one seemed to really care about it any more however this makes me so excited im about to wet myself the thought that a private entity can take people into space is incredible i cant wait to see the outcome
space,not_removed,does anyone know when elon musk will be accepting starfleet applications
space,not_removed,holy shit space tourism there we go for real i mean people probably dont realize yet what it means its huuuuuge
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,please be matt damon please be matt damon please be matt damon
space,not_removed,this is awesome news but at the same time isnt it really sad were having to take baby steps again for things we once did nearly years ago
space,not_removed,when elon pulls this off bezos will respond with welcome to the space tourism club
space,not_removed,shoot for the moon that way if you miss youll just die in the cold vacuum of space
space,not_removed,not gonna lie i got chills when i read the release i am so excited for this
space,not_removed,you know it just occurred to me spacex is basically elon musk playing kerbal space program in real life not that im complaining because nasa isnt going anywhere with their budget
space,not_removed,reality check spacex has a crew capsule contract with nasa and they have delayed that this is only a leo crew capsule not deep space the spacex crew capsule has yet to be shown even in the test version which is due in a month or two after the unmanned tests there were certification tests with test pilots those are still required or permission to launch will not be given private or government spacex hasnt shown anything close to a several ton payload capability around the moon the falcon heavy potentially has the capability but it hasnt had its delayed maiden launch yet spacex has demonstrated zero moon capability at all a falcon could be used to launch a third stage to take a satellite to the moon but this hasnt been done showing zero moon capability right now
space,not_removed,not trying to be a hater here but this is an unrealistic timeframe even by spacexs standards im not saying it cant be done and if they can pull this off then kudos to them but keep in mind that the only people who have been around the moon and back had decades of flight experience and years of training this isnt even bringing up the fact that spacex has yet to even launch a person into space
space,not_removed,i imagine the person who paid the most will be like the rich couple from gilligans island
space,not_removed,i bet one of the two is leonardo dicaprio we already know that leo paid for a trip into earths orbit on richard brandsons venture
space,not_removed,this is so wild im so glad they are doing a moon mission during my life time didnt think i would see it happen
space,not_removed,holy shit i cannot express how emotionally excited i am about this its been years since humans have been anywhere near the moon and this time were actually venturing further from home than ever before sure its not an actual lunar landing or a mission to mars but i didnt anticipate anything to this degree until at least the this is really cool
space,not_removed,it will be exciting if all goes well but im certainly not raising my hand for this mission
space,not_removed,worst case scenario is that you will die in the cold depths of space while you were conducting a milestone mission for space exploration that you paid for i dont think there is a better way to go
space,not_removed,one thing is for sure the two persons who are doing this are lunatics
space,not_removed,tourists should be flat earth believers record their reactions would love to see that
space,not_removed,this is the world i want to live in where instead of going to a beach on vacation you take a trip around the moon
space,not_removed,elon musk is notorious for being overlygenerous with his time estimates pretty sure he said space x would be sending astronauts to space in three years back in so well see
space,not_removed,can we then have some unredacted pictures from space or the other side of the moon
space,not_removed,need more of these absurdly rich people paying to go to space then personal spacecrafts that start at like might actually become a thing
space,not_removed,read that as sending partially chewed dragon spaceship i neeed sleep

space,not_removed,very excited to see this news what spacex and nasa need right now is high profile publicity and this is a step in the right direction i support scientific experimentation and research aboard the iss as well as rovers probes etc but many people are not interested or lose interest very quickly in these long term goals successfully put two big names up there and the aerospaceaeronautics industry will benefit immensely also very interested to see that this was announced in such close proximity to the us governments military spending increase announcement
space,not_removed,this almost makes you forget that the falcons blew a huge lead and lost the superbowl
space,not_removed,i wonder if these two private citizens are bill gates and melinda gates
space,not_removed,a megacorporation may send humans to space and back if one of them is sigourney weaver
space,not_removed,guys guys what if its jim lovell and buzz aldrin think about it they are both pretty well off now and certainly wouldnt give a fuck about dieing up there
space,not_removed,silly spacex youre supposed to wait until im eligible for spaceflight
space,not_removed,●°¤ ○ ●earth °moon ○mars ¤dragon spacecraft or their abouts
space,not_removed,i love what spacex is doing they a pushing every boundaries there is when it comes to space it is what we need i just hope i see space exploration become a much larger of humanity before i say goodbye to earth
space,not_removed,they will travel faster and further into the solar system than any before them i wonder if this implies itll be a freereturn trajectory and theyll beat the apollo record of being the furthest humans have ever gone from earth that would be cool but id rather get to do loi and spend more time at the moon
space,not_removed,well you have to credit them for being ambitious but it would be great if they could explain how they are going to successfully manrate the falcon heavy by when it doesnt fully exist yet despite the fact that no private company has launched a person into even low earth orbit
space,not_removed,i love the dude but he is famous for always exaggerating with his deadlines i wouldnt be surprised if they post pone it to
space,not_removed,two private citizens hmmmm my money is on james cameron and richard branson
space,not_removed,hey uplutoandcharon this is now the top post on reddit it will be recorded at rtopofreddit with all the other top posts
space,not_removed,i think itll be the first step in sparking more public interest in space exploration and will involve even more space missions
space,not_removed,holy fuck humans havent left leo since decadesif musk pulls this off
space,not_removed,sending people beyond the moon is easy keeping them alive and bringing them back is the hard part
space,not_removed,honestly its money well spent there are a lot of ways to waste vast amounts of money on unnecessary things but traveling through space is not one of them
space,not_removed,finally its been years since we went to the moon just imagine the quality of the pictures we will get if all goes well its going to be mind blowing
space,not_removed,go for it they understand the risks get good insurance and go for it its time to move on with space travel private industry has the money and the workforce to get the job done its an exciting time in science
space,not_removed,i love this a few days ago there are reports of nasa being asked to consider doing a manned flight around the moon instead of a planned test flight with crash test dummies sometime in and then elon announces screw that we going to the moon next year
space,not_removed,woke up this morning to read this yet all news media outlets are obsessed with what happened at the oscars earth is doomed people sign me up to colonise mars
space,not_removed,theyre basically recreating apollo lots of questions still to be answered on how and who will be facinating to watch as they are answered
space,not_removed,its about time we are getting back into space travel after like years
space,not_removed,reminder that spacex hasnt even sent a bucket of instruments around the moon and back
space,not_removed,i wonder how much a ticket to the moon cost them spacex is going out of their way to do a new mission for them must have been a helluva lot of money
space,not_removed,no whammies no whammies no whammies no whammies no whammies spacex does not need another hit smooth sailing here on out
space,not_removed,elon musk is a steely eyed missile man spacex was his most ambitious venture ever and he keeps delivering im not a huge fan of his hyperloop project simply because of its engineering infeasibility but spacex is what he will be remembered for pushing nasa to finally send people out further than leo again it is a long time coming and im excited
space,not_removed,i will finally get to see a moon landing hope it helps them prepare for mars d shy apparently it says around the moon so not necessarily a moon landing but still yay
space,not_removed,technically theyd be illegal aliens if they landed there unless they had proper documentation from the galactic government
space,not_removed,pretty sure this trip will get delayed as of much of teslas promises
space,not_removed,if the spacecraft is rocking dont bother docking sex in space ftw
space,not_removed,once successful will be the most powerful vehicle to reach orbit after the saturn v moon rocket why does everybody forget about energia two successful launch
space,not_removed,five bucks says elon musk turns out to be one of those private citizens
space,not_removed,i thought this was a privately chewed dragon spacecraft mildly disappointed
space,not_removed,id love to imagine these two bought thousands of bitcoins at like back in the day so they literally got on their bitcoin rocket to the moon
space,not_removed,think spacex will go for the holy grail and go for a powered decent back to the earth
space,not_removed,wow this is awesome so it only took a genius with to challenge big oil and nasa this is exciting go elon
space,not_removed,im so excited for this to happen but understand that spacex and elon musk like to be very aggressive with their timeline estimates and often miss them dont be surprised if this takes a couple years to happen
space,not_removed,if spacex pulls this off as stated in then obviously there will be people in cue for moonlandings by oh boy oh boy
space,not_removed,how much money did they give them to put their reputation on the line this is crazy
space,not_removed,they should do a live vr stream so everyone can share the experience of taking the trip either way its awesome and very exciting but it presents an amazing opportunity for both vr and space exploration
space,not_removed,cant wait to see the selfie stick used with earth in the background my instagram followers will flip
space,not_removed,i honestly hope that its richard branson and obama that would be cute d
space,not_removed,i hope i live to see awesome moderatelypriced space tours that i can actually consider going on but probably not because im terribly afraid of heights and airplanes sigh
space,not_removed,private corporations will be the interstellar nations of the future im from and you
space,not_removed,where i live in texas we know spaceex is testing rockets bc it feels like an earth quake i assume since i have never been in an earth quake a lot of people complain but i think its pretty cool
space,not_removed,the most powerful vehicle to reach orbit after the saturn v moon rocket what about energia
space,not_removed,i love throughout his whole time in the space industry and probably before that that his heros have been the original astronauts ad the interview where her tears up about neil armstrong and the originals bashing him always gets me rite in the feels
space,not_removed,privatized space exploration is gonna be so awesome or at least in its early stage are we gonna find any life are there going to be some sort of space gold rush to mine planets will there be colonialisation space nations and politics gotta try and live as long as possible and witness as much as possible
space,not_removed,yes exactly the stuff i want to happen under my lifetime also gives me hope not like the mess of political stuff people try shoving down each others throats
space,not_removed,hours late but that god this is happening this has made me so happy
space,not_removed,all glory to emperor musk first sovereign of the terran empire his vision took us to the stars and let us conquer the galaxy a toast from
space,not_removed,soace x is absolutelly on fire right now imagine what they could do in years time
space,not_removed,what protocols are in place to handle the event ifwhen one of these manned missions goes awry rendering the crew unable to return to earth
space,not_removed,i wonder if it is burt rutan wanting to do his lowaltitude flyby of the moon
space,not_removed,what happens if they die does spacex get in trouble with the law or it just like any other worker died on the job
space,not_removed,it will never happen in they still havent tried sending astronauts to the iss so it will be more something like since they need to do shit lots of tests before sending an actual human around the moon
space,not_removed,im betting its richard bransonnot sure on the second passenger but ill figuratively eat my hat if one of them isnt him also ive never been quite this jealous in all my life
space,not_removed,fly two private citizens on a trip around the moon late next year i will be so amazingly surprised if this actually happens by late an awesome prospect though
space,not_removed,this will have an interesting effect on the apollo denier flatearth subculture on youtube
space,not_removed,i wonder if they are going to do a test mission before and sending an unmanned dragon around the moon obviously this would double the costs but if i were rich enough to pay for a trip to the moon i sure would pay twice the amount to make it less likely that im going to die
space,not_removed,sothis is it the age of space tourism has officially started i know the russian seats from a few years ago but that only gets to orbit
space,not_removed,hopefully one day will be have a fully privately funded launch of private astronauts going to the moon and other planets we need to break the grip of government on space programs so real technological progress can be made
space,not_removed,so maybe or based on musk timelines dont get me wrong i think the guy and what he has accomplished are incredible and i am super excited about anything he tries to get done but cmon
space,not_removed,so what will all the flat earth people say if this happens that this was fake too
space,not_removed,comically unrealistic timeframe almost zero proof of necessary tech no professional crew this is a no hoper
space,not_removed,for a while ive been disappointed that its highly unlikely that there will be another moon landing in time for the anniversary of apollo but then i thought of something here what if this moon flight is meant to coincide with the anniversary of apollo december is far enough in to feel like a reasonable goal and it also the same date of the first manned flight beyond leo
space,not_removed,honestly i dont mind how every spacex post magically reaches the front page most of the time its intriguing things
space,not_removed,inevitably this thread is full of people who although excited about and interested in space exploration dont have expertise in the industry nor have worked in it and those people are extremely excited about this and think it will actually happen sorry to burst the bubble but elon muskspacex tend to release these public statements often whenever they need cash going to the moon is hard and to say youre going there in a year yet release no details about whowhathow they will get there is all you need to know about the viability of this announcement remember the announcement about spacex going to mars only months ago or their many announcements to send humans just to leo spacex is not some sort of magical company that can do anything nor are they very wealthy so they need announcements like this to get current investors excited and new investors to join remember a similar announcement about going to mars was made only a few months ago yet we havent heard a thing about it since our best hope is to increase nasas budget and allow companies like boeing lockheed northrup grumman to work with nasa like they have been for the last years thats how we advance space exploration not pandering to the dreams of a software billionaire who doesnt himself know a lot about space exploration yet who also needs to make investors in his rocket company happy remember the hyperloop proposal and how error prone that was nothing came of that either
space,not_removed,but can you smoke weed while going around the moon thats the real question
space,not_removed,its crazy how many people just dont understand the gravity lol of this i just explained it to my missus and shes staring at me like its nothing she thinks theres lots of little astronaut guys floating around all over space shes adorable
space,not_removed,this is huge i mean this is huge this is hopefully a huge shot in the ass for the average american to quell their apathy towards space and space travel
space,not_removed,spacex maned mission beyond the moon oh private tourists
space,not_removed,cant wait for or video of the moon
space,not_removed,i cant wait for a hires photo or video of the full earth and see how the flat earthers respond to it
space,not_removed,a friend of mine asked a very good question why are we exploring and wanting to colonize space when we could colonize the ocean which is right next to us we could stay in the ocean if a meteor hits and makes the surface uninhabitable right basically he wants to know why space and not the ocean
space,not_removed,youre not really rich until you can rebrand condiments
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,he didnt mention that the passengers are he and his clone
space,not_removed,when space adventures first started advertising cislunar flights as an opportunity the price was million if i recall correctly found it
space,not_removed,i thought i was doing well when i could stop going down to the mcdonalds to get on reddit
space,not_removed,its just a guess but ill be shocked if richard branson isnt one of them hes rich enough crazy enough and old enough that hes probably done everything on earth that he could hes right now but as i understand it hed just be a passenger john glenn made a space flight at so its not without precedent for the second i think felix baumgartner sponsored again by red bull would be fun
space,not_removed,i really wonder who the two are perhaps elon what a twist that would be
space,not_removed,rich means not caring that avacado is extra
space,not_removed,omg knowing spacex livestreams and their enthusiasm for public engagement its going to be amazing im envisioning hr hd livestreams out of the window the two mystery passengers will be instant international celebrities
space,not_removed,this is justin news so i havent been able to fully digest it that said im excited and really looking forward to this at the same time though these billionaires will probably claim the records for farthest human from earth and other things that seems like the kind of stuff our government should be doing am i just being an old man is this just how the future of space flight works i miss you nasa i miss watching every shuttle launch as a kid
space,not_removed,thats only if nasa puts astronauts on the first launch of the sls which it will hopefully not do not to mention thats only if spacex can achieve the timeline it has set regarding the falcon heavy which i for one doubt that said nasa currently plans to send folks up on the sls in during the second sls launch even if musk slips this date by two whole years which is generous even for musk hell still beat nasa
space,not_removed,its definitely possible but a lot of hurdles to overcome falcon heavy needs to be flight proven and manrated it is supposed to fly later this year unmanned crew dragon mission to the isslow earth orbit this year unmanned crew dragon inflight abort test this year dragon certified as humanrated craft iss crew mission at best spacex needs to go months without a rud in the last ish months they have had june and august dragon being able to handle a long endurance mission going to the moon takes several days evidently spacex thinks they can handle it
space,not_removed,is it still a manned lunar mission if theyre not actually landing and putting people on the moon i didnt see anything in the article that implied people were actually going out onto the moon the article is saying its a moon flyby
space,not_removed,this makes sense as of now spacexs hardware is much more flightproven than nasas and would be less risky for a manned mission i really wish people wouldnt see this as a competition between government and private industry though i am genuinely excited about the sls program and saddened by the hero worship often placed behind musk and spacex to the exclusion of nasa i think both organizations benefit from working cooperatively with one another and both realize the importance of privategovernment collaboration spacex acknowledged in its announcement the vital role nasa plays in funding the development of dragon and nasa has been giving a lot of support to the commercial crew program and is banking on spacex and boeing to take america back to space long story short i like it when anyone is working towards space exploration and hope we can all get along
space,not_removed,and anniversary of apollo which has similar mission profile
space,not_removed,its about time we stretched our legs
space,not_removed,on the plus side if it goes extremely smoothly and is marketed and shown heavily it can ease the fears people have of investing and developing in space exploration
space,not_removed,yeah am i the only one that thinks this might still be a little too early i know i havent watched every single mission spacex does but it seems like i hear of one crashing like twice a year i also know that space travel will be dangerous for many many years and there will always be harsh odds but still it seems sort of early if you ask me maybe someone with more knowledge can bring up my optimism
space,not_removed,if these people die it will be a huge setback for the industry lol no it wont bad publicity maybe but not a setback for space travel there are literally hundreds of thousands of competent people capable of making trips like this who would happily put themselves in a life threatening situation just to go to space and be a pioneer space is dangerous people dont belong there and people will die during the process of exploring it go back to the and you could say the same thing about the search for new lands and trade routes across the vast uncharted oceans of the earth explorers have a different mindset and death is a risk that has always come with that profession
space,not_removed,quarantine yourself for the next year just in case
space,not_removed,youve managed to not die every single day before this so just keep doing the same stuff
space,not_removed,we are getting o l d b o y s
space,not_removed,as of tomorrow we will in fact be one sixth of the way through
space,not_removed,only if they have sex on the dark side of the moon i can only assume this will definitely happen
space,not_removed,there are some complications httpsenmwikipediaorgwikisexinspace
space,not_removed,itll be awesome when it happens i can only imagine how expensive that trip will be though correct me if im wrong but at present a falcon launch is around probably more since they need a dragon and probably even more for the training and equipment required for humans
space,not_removed,you go to cinema
space,not_removed,hopefully it will become mainstream and affordable enough for us commoners before i get to old but i doubt it tho
space,not_removed,yeah its going to be awesome watching all these ceos go on space tours
space,not_removed,my body cant handle how cool this is
space,not_removed,how i imagine the conversation went elon fly us to the moon do you have a shitload of money why yes ok
space,not_removed,so we have to rescue him again
space,not_removed,only if bo launches a human before spx launches to the moon that race may be close
space,not_removed,not on a freereturn trajectory
space,not_removed,actually nasa is doing plenty with their budget its just not a sexy enough headline so unless you actually care about this sort of thing you probably have no idea
space,not_removed,juno curiosity the james webb telescope new horizons the mars rover cassini ya nasa really hasnt been doing anything
space,not_removed,we are excited to announce that spacex has been approached to fly two private citizens on a trip around the moon late next year its basically a standard kerbal contract
space,not_removed,not saying youre wrong but to try and steady the balance a bit dragon has been designed as a deepspace crew capsule from the start the crew version will not be something brand new rather an upgraded version of the current dragon capsule which has successful missions under its belt falcon heavy is not really a brand new rocket either its composed of flightproven falcon one would expect that after delays to both the crewed capsule and falcon heavy both projects are now close to being gold especially since spacex has reinforced their timelines in the last few months spacex is a very agile and surprising company as it has proven countless times im pretty sure the end of deadline wont be met however i think is a very realistic target barring any disasters meanwhile
space,not_removed,exspacex employee here can confirm that elon is notorious for setting unattainable deadlines ie falcon heavy test launch core reusability tesla production timeline hes a hype man and uses these proposed events to make headlines i wouldnt call complete bs but i would be surprised if they will get those astronauts in space in currently spacex is a long way from getting approval for manned flights
space,not_removed,thank you to put that into perspective spacex indeed has a tendance to delay things
space,not_removed,dragon is designed with deep space in mind
space,not_removed,to be fair dscovr had a similar but slightly larger energy budget than a free return lunar trajectory does so id say that is covered
space,not_removed,counterarguments spacex has a crew capsule contract with nasa and they have delayed that this is only a leo crew capsule not deep space dragon tps was the spacex crew capsule has yet to be shown even in the test version which is due in a month or two after the unmanned tests there were certification tests with test pilots those are still required or permission to launch will not be given private or government all of these are presently planned for later and early before the listed late launch date spacex hasnt shown anything close to a several ton payload capability around the moon the falcon heavy potentially has the capability but it hasnt had its delayed maiden launch yet falcon heavy is penciled in for a demo flight in of this year according to rspacex spacex has demonstrated zero moon capability at all a falcon could be used to launch a third stage to take a satellite to the moon but this hasnt been done showing zero moon capability right now which is what i assume this is and spacex does that with falcon all the time
space,not_removed,dragon has the heat shield and life support capability for this mission comfortably not sure why you think of dragon as leo only in capability the announcement clearly states this mission would follow uncrewed and crewed missions to iss and dragon the mission follows at least the initial falcon heavy demonstration if it doesnt go forward neither does this mission but thats rather obvious not sure of your argument here they hadnt demonstrated launch capability orbital capability geo capability iss rendezvous capability stage landing capability ect until they did you know how you demonstrate capability you go do it is the timeframe ambitious absolutely i wouldnt bet on it happening by not with any money i need anyhow but youre not really saying anything everyone doesnt know going in
space,not_removed,this is classic musk though he provides unrealistic stretch timeframes and deliverables for his projects sometimes they hit it on time sometimes not it will happen but maybe not in his aggressive timeframe
space,not_removed,yeah but that was way back when nowadays itll all be autopilot theyll just be passengers they wont have to actually do anything
space,not_removed,there will be unmanned dragon leo flight manned dragon flights to iss and falcon heavy launches before this flight is scheduled space flights are planned out years in advance also modern space craft are fully automated so there is zero need for any flight experience in addition if a craft is on a free return trajectory there is literally nothing that crew on board can actually do with the craft all actions are already done during the launch sequence and the rest of the day flight is just free unpowered flight until the reentry sequence kicks in also automatically
space,not_removed,they havent flown the capsule as far as i know and i may be totally missing something big they havent done a single manned flight at all seems like lots of opportunities for stuff to push the schedule back i really am rooting for all this stuff to work perfectly firsttry and for this to go off on schedule but we have decades of experience trying stuff this complicated and particularly when you shift to adding in the level of safety needed for human passengers the track record is that these sorts of things slip schedulewise
space,not_removed,apollo went around the moon as well did he say whether this would beat their record
space,not_removed,no need to emphasise that is the origin of the word
space,not_removed,sounds good in theory but i think there should be psychological qualifications when you risk sending people up in space i dont think flat earth people would pass those tests i dont want trying to mess this up
space,not_removed,and suddenly i believe that the earth is flat and nothing will convince me otherwise
space,not_removed,i love that theres a scott manley video in this list
space,not_removed,when kennedy announced the moon program the us had not gotten anyone into orbit either granted longer time frame but spacex is much further along both in terms of historical knowledge and inhouse research and they are going for a flyby not a landing so they do not have as far to go either
space,not_removed,in between now and then they have a manned and unmanned flight planned for crew dragon as part of cots so while the timeline on this is ambitious it will be after extensive testing
space,not_removed,a big reason for the iss crew mission delay was congress underfunding nasas program
space,not_removed,true of course that was also assuming the program was fully funded each year that didnt happen
space,not_removed,well the coming back is free if you send them on a free return trajectory keeping them alive is the tricky bit
space,not_removed,and the next time we land on the moon those pictures are going to be amazing
space,not_removed,is next year
space,not_removed,its almost as if muskspacex are positioning themselves to nudge the sls project to be dropped in favor of drumming up a joint its effort sooner rather than later
space,not_removed,they have to orbit launches including dragons theyve also sent a satellite to a million miles away a lunar freereturn trajectory isnt a huge jump for them
space,not_removed,it fits in as a test and confirmation of the capsule ignorant here is this just a figure orbit or will it orbit moon for some time
space,not_removed,its not a moon landing just a flyby read the article
space,not_removed,there will be some moon landings this year though in the google lunar xprize unmanned but still pretty awesome
space,not_removed,bet confirmed when they release the names and its not elon musk please send me a pm and well figure out details on how you can transfer me the funds
space,not_removed,just keep away from the bug planets just sayin
space,not_removed,it was
space,not_removed,radio your goodbyes and remove the lithium hydroxide canisters cabin fills with and you go to sleep
space,not_removed,no it wont i have come to the conclusion that they are so mentally deficient that even in the face of overwhelming evidence and proof they will perform some mental gymnastics to explain their way out of it their logic is a closed loop incapable of accepting information outside of their belief system its confirmation bias taken to an extreme it is literally not worth the time to interact with these people simply ignore them and hope darwinism sorts itself out on that front
space,not_removed,sorry that title goes to werner
space,not_removed,the missions scheduled before this one are unmanned dragon leo flight manned dragon flights to iss and falcon heavy launches there is nothing really special about lunar free return trajectory to test
space,not_removed,as they are only flying around the moon the technical challenges arent that much more than a standard leo flight theres just higher speeds so bigger launcher and tougher reentry and more time spent in the capsule of course they are yet to demonstrate any crewed flight but its still worth noting
space,not_removed,five years ago would you have imagined spacex could land a rocket on a barge
space,not_removed,that really depends on whether or not the cots milestones slip if they hit their schedule they will launch a capsule test flight mid summer with a crewed flight before end of the year fh has a demo launch this spring and a few on the manifest for later this year considering that modern falcon ft is more capable than the initial payload capacity of the early fh proposals this is feasible so it isnt a slam dunk but things certainly arent as dim as youre making out
space,not_removed,comically unrealistic timeframe almost zero proof of necessary tech no professional crew this is a no hoper an elon musk project its hard not to love the guy for it
space,not_removed,havent you been watching trumps press conferences thats how we do now
space,not_removed,im smarter than the genius that has built several multi billion dollar companies
space,not_removed,on the mars front spacex have stated that they arent increasing the itsbfr team until falcon and falcon heavy are done and in regular production the ship is not expected to be built before at the earliest they have recently been testing components humans to leo is the commercial crew project for which they have been getting the certifications done over the last few years the unmanned test flight prior to manned is due this year as for not releasing details its a crew dragon on top of the falcon heavy finally due to fly this summer after years of delay they are testing cores for the heavy currently the mission is paid for by a pair of private individuals who will be the passengers the mission is a free return trajectory those are the released details about the only thing not covered are the named of the passengers and the colour of the space suits and hyperloop vehicle tests were run last month edit and to address the other comment im still wondering what happened to their plans to send humans to leo or cargo to the iss they send cargo to the iss on a regular basis the last delivery was last weekend
space,not_removed,sorry to burst the bubble but elon muskspacex tend to release these public statements often whenever they need cash spacex is a private company so im curious how you know that they need funding going to the moon is hard and to say youre going there in a year yet release no details about whowhathow they will get there is all you need to know about the viability of this announcement what do you mean no details two private customers are paying for a dragon spacecraft which has been in development for years and was designed from the start for deep space operation to be launched on a freereturn trajectory around the moon by a falcon heavy which has also been in development for years and appears to finally be nearing a maiden flight whats not clear remember a similar announcement about going to mars was made only a few months ago yet we havent heard a thing about it since if by nothing you mean then sure also it was said in the announcement that a very tiny fraction of spacexs workforce is dedicated to mars right now thats expected to change once the falcon design is finalized later this year our best hope is to increase nasas budget and allow companies like boeing lockheed northrup grumman to work with nasa like they have been for the last years and why not include companies like spacex and blue origin who have shown that theyre already committed to developing the necessary technologies rather than waiting around for an rfp remember the hyperloop proposal and how error prone that was nothing came of that either the hyperloop was never something that spacex was actively interested in developing they wanted other companies and organizations to utilize the technology did you think was a publicity stunt to raise funds too what about recovering the falcon first stage that satellite internet constellation they announced a while back they bought a factory in washington and to launch two test satellites spacex obviously has a tendency to set ambitious goals with aggressive timelines but they dont just let them fall by the wayside
space,not_removed,remember the announcement about spacex going to mars only months ago yes they are going in and the every two years after did you expect them to be on mars by now or something remember a similar announcement about going to mars was made only a few months ago yet we havent heard a thing about it since yes we have we saw they did many tests on their massive carbon fiber composite fuel tank they have a raptor engine made and is in testing there is a lot of time between now and i dont expect updates too frequently only months after the announcement our best hope is to increase nasas budget and allow companies like boeing lockheed northrup grumman to work with nasa like they have been for the last years yeah lets give all the money to legacy space companies who are afraid of innovation and do things the same way they have been done for decades not to one actually innovating and trying new things that will have drastic impacts on the industry remember the hyperloop proposal and how error prone that was nothing came of that either remember how spacex had nothing to do with that besides hosting a contest for universities obviously you dont do some research
space,not_removed,i feel you this is like when nasa has these press conferences that everyone gets so incredibly and irrationally excited about and what do those amount to we found stronger evidence to support the evidence we had already that liquid water may have existed on mars or we found some more exoplanets dozens of light years away no we cant actually optically see them no we cant realistically ever go there in any of our lifetimes nasa does this to drum up support and pr their budget gets screwed with each time a new president is in office they turn bread crumbs into wedding cakes skunkworks does it too wheres their fusion reactor i thought they were super close its all about increasing visibility and hype so when i heard this news i went yawn we couldshould have been to mars years ago and have a functioning semipermanent colony there by now i guess they havent finished cleaning things up there yet or something
space,not_removed,never expect other people to emulate your emotional interest in something people have other priorities dare i say humanity has other priorities than aggrandizing the joy ride two rich people are going on
space,not_removed,gopro would definitely pay to get their camera up there
space,not_removed,if i went to the moon id totally shoot a fake moon landing video on the actual moon with fake looking lights and everything
space,not_removed,japan was streaming hd way back in edit im happy that the streaming context of this video confused so many people p yes this is real footage and was streamed live but this channel is just a replay of pieces of it
space,not_removed,actually the moon might be one of the few places where hdr video would be noticeably better
space,not_removed,in raw and make them public domain please
space,not_removed,with that change better be minimum
space,not_removed,cant wait for footage of the landing sites from orbit
space,not_removed,the same they did as up till now you have pictures and a live stream of the earth just now
space,not_removed,they already have cameras strapped on the falcon flatearthers argue that its lens distortion
space,not_removed,theyll react the same as they do every time we take a photo of the earth from space id rather show them a lunar eclipse and how the edge earths shadow is curved as it transits the moon aristotle deduced a round earth this way thousands of years ago
space,not_removed,our then tv is flat earth is still flat go ahead touch it youll see all rejoicing flatearthers
space,not_removed,shown undeniable proof that the earth is not flat look man you can either choose to respect my belief or not
space,not_removed,even if they held a contest to send a random citizen along with them that person would obviously be a shill paid actor etc hell you could shoot a flat earther around the moon and theyd claim the freemasons used mkuktra mind control to make them only think they did
space,not_removed,i wonder how many of real flat earth believers there are in this world my parents would disown me if i was one
space,not_removed,basically the footage is just vfx its all shot in some studio and had postproduction done on them its obviously nasas evil propaganda to achieve victory
space,not_removed,it would basically mean that we would put even more pressure on our own planet plus if we can spread out into space mankind would never become extinct
space,not_removed,a big part of the civilizational benefit to all of humanity that spaceflight nets is living in a separate biosphere as part of the same biosphere ocean habitations are as succeptible to biosphere collapse as anywhere else on the earth is only habitations in space or on other planets have a separated biosphere which gets us a big dividend in long term species survivability its quite likely also that space habitations will unlock ocean habitation with the same technology but the reverse is not true
space,not_removed,there is less space in the ocean
space,not_removed,because sealing air pressure in when the pressure is basically non existent outside is way way way easier than sealing the crushing pressure out with the right air generationcycling systems humans could live in a space station exposed to the vacuum of space with little impact say with a meteor impact busting open the station an underwater city has to deal with the constant battle to keep stuff out and one failure destroys the whole thing a spaceship in general is very thin skinned except any pieces that must sustain heat on return or during thrust think of the hull of even a small submersible its much thicker because water pressure is a hell of a thing
space,not_removed,because space is fucking dank
space,not_removed,a lot of sunkcosts in rd for nuclear genocide also double as civilian space tech this was specially true by the start of the space race scifi related to there still isnt a commercial case for nonsubsidized profitable permanent space colonization there may never be one there is an insane amount of natural resources in space and wed avoid extinction if something goes very bad on earth but getting those resources isnt yet commercially viable and we dont know if permanent colonization of low gravity bodies is possible think of the effects of during pregnancy for instance would the fetus develop would it be born with deformities would pregnancies result in spontaneous abortions can a fetus develop in less than we dont know
space,not_removed,i wonder what type of launcher they are using for the dragon moon mission can the falcon handle it
space,not_removed,i once voted in a official internet poll to rebrand a product does that count
space,not_removed,so its confirmed that the passengers are the ceos of heinz and hellmans then
space,not_removed,thats million roscosmos was charging sounds too cheap
space,not_removed,as i recall in a heinlein book a rich guy and three teenagers httpsenwikipediaorgwikirocketshipgalileo
space,not_removed,i think they were basing that off a protonzonddiet soyuz flight too
space,not_removed,look at these fat cats going to mcdonalds here i am trying to get wifi while i eat lentils and beans
space,not_removed,dunno doesnt branson have his own space program
space,not_removed,imagine richard branson and barack obama fly to the moon on a spacex mission
space,not_removed,what about him and james cameron it would be the perfect duo
space,not_removed,james cameron is one i bet
space,not_removed,he likely couldnt go anyways hes too important for the prolonged success of his companies to risk being lost
space,not_removed,its for a reality show theyve told two sworn enemies that they have been given a once in a lifetime trip the only catch is they have to spend days in a tiny space together
space,not_removed,one of them is probably kyrie irving doing his research to once and for all prove the earth is flat and weve been lied to all along
space,not_removed,hmm well netflix cough up for series i can quite see a episode reality series following two individuals as they train and fly into space
space,not_removed,page and brin already are semicelebrities
space,not_removed,probably are already well known
space,not_removed,should the government be ahead of the game on space flight at the moment probably yes weve done incredible things in terms of space flight but were also at a very early stage i feel like the space agencies should have taken a leading role until reusable rockets were safe and common however although i am naturally inclined to be skeptical of private companies ultimately they do represent human freedom in a better way as well as help move progress on faster i mean when this flight is a huge widely publicised success the number of people wholl want to fly around the moon will go up pretty dramatically that means that spacex will have another fairly lucrative source of revenue which will help the company grow blue origins will want to compete this is the first step to commercial spaceflight which is pretty amazing thats not a conversation anyone thought wed be having in heres hoping we learn to fund our space agencies properly
space,not_removed,of nasas work has always been done by contractors and nasa is still involved with this flight its launching from pad at the kennedy space center the same pad modified that apollo launched from
space,not_removed,of interest news came out a couple days ago that nasa had been asked to do a feasibility assessment on sending up humans on the first sls launch
space,not_removed,dragon would be the timeline problem not falcon heavy falcon heavy needs months of delays to cause a problem dragon only needs months
space,not_removed,yep even though its musk were talking about he has a lot of leeway and nasas launch date is only going to slip further in an ideal scenario they would both happen at around the same time to prove that the way forward in space exploration isnt one or the other its a harmony of government agencies commercial spaceflight working together
space,not_removed,just out of curiousity to rspace why are people generally ok with spacex saying fuckit with private crews lives but not with nasa doing the same
space,not_removed,unmanned crew dragon mission to the isslow earth orbit this year hasnt the dragon been transporting cargo to the iss for a while now or is an unmanned crew dragon mission something different
space,not_removed,yes because youre still sending men to and around the moon if it were a landing itd be called a manned lunar landing mission a manned lunar mission is absolutely an appropriate name for this mission
space,not_removed,so its either complete prosperity or complete devastation id take that risk
space,not_removed,the google lunar xprize teams will have landed robots on the moon by the time of this mission too glxp has healthy press as it is so it should be big news once actual landings are attempted
space,not_removed,space is dangerous people dont belong there and people will die during the process of exploring it but the industry here is space tourism not exploration billionaires arent going to spend tens of millions to travel to the moon if theres a significant risk of death it needs to be basically as safe as normal air travel
space,not_removed,this is an incredibly naive comment were you alive for the shuttle explosions thats a horrible comparison so many things have changed since the its one thing when people go off and you just flat out never hear from them again whether they live or die its another when its being broadcast around the world in hd
space,not_removed,unfortunately the perception of the general public matters not just the portion of the population with the explorer mindset
space,not_removed,really what did the shuttle explosions do for the industry
space,not_removed,just um makes sure youve poked some air holes into your quarantine box
space,not_removed,directions unclear died of starvation
space,not_removed,uh oh whos gonna be fucking their daughter
space,not_removed,not quite since february is a short month february is only the day of the year which is less than of
space,not_removed,whether the two people are lovers friends or strangers how could they not take advantage of the opportunity to join the club
space,not_removed,thats called the pink floyd club
space,not_removed,you only get minutes of radio silence
space,not_removed,they will be using the falcon heavy iirc so it will be more like falcon heavy is boosters strapped together
space,not_removed,the really huge part of this is that spacex can then turn around and say would you also want to land on the moon well we are developing the its right over here that would have the power to deliver that would you like to put down a deposit
space,not_removed,there were only years between the first ever flight by the wright brothers and the first moon landing technology is advancing at an ever increasing rate im pretty hopeful that itll be affordable before too long
space,not_removed,its better they spend their money on extravagant trips like this than say paying their fair share of taxes
space,not_removed,eventually well get good at it besides if they send james cameron up with a camera well have an amazing imax quality movie when they get rescued edit apparently i had the dumbs and confused two camerons
space,not_removed,matt damon stranded on moon and the rescue movie will be the lunatic
space,not_removed,deleted
space,not_removed,thanks guys i am now both moderately excited and skeptical about this event
space,not_removed,the sls block i isnt really a brand new rocket either its just composed of the shuttle fuel tank some disposable space shuttle engines and two upgraded boosters slapped to the side id say it will be ready to go as soon as
space,not_removed,id be happy if someone got to the moon by oh say july gotta do something special for the big
space,not_removed,hes a smart guy his hype must do some good for the company is spacex and tesla publicly traded
space,not_removed,what kind of work did you do at spacex i am currently studying computer scienceengineering and i am interesting in possibly applying to a private space company like spacex after a few years of work experience what were the working conditions like and is it as cool as i imagine
space,not_removed,sucks that these comments are so low down my first thought at this was ill believe it when i see it especially about that date
space,not_removed,elon runs on mars years so all his schedules have to be multiplied by to convert to earth years
space,not_removed,exactly theyre even planning to send an unmanned one to mars sure this might get a bit delayed but i have no doubt that it will happen and as far as the falcon heavy delays theree been a running joke that its always months away however weve recently seen side boosters being transported which means were likely finally within months of the first flight
space,not_removed,a correction spacex doesnt put things into a geosynchronous orbitthey put satellites into geostationary transfer orbits and circularization is handled by the satellites themselves a lunar flyby will require significantly more deltav than a gto launch though it should be well within a falcon heavys capabilities
space,not_removed,thats what im saying not impossible at all just a huge stretch in such a short time frame
space,not_removed,while i agree that tech has gotten so good that they wont have to fly it themselves theres no way those ships are launching without an experienced pilot what if the automated systems fail what if communications fail etcsomeone has to be able to get those people back to earth
space,not_removed,its not actually that hard a can of some scrubbers and heat is all it takes minimum reentry is the worst and they have good data on the pico shield at this point
space,not_removed,nasas sometime in probably means or maybe unless the whole project gets cancelled elons next year probably means edit i think nasa is also responsible for figuring out the release date for rick morty season
space,not_removed,so yes a figure it seems
space,not_removed,from the article to fly two private citizens on a trip around the moon late next year no mention of landing
space,not_removed,i meant more from the perspective that i find that culture entertaining and im curious how they will react to this event if it happens your observations seem to be correct though regardless
space,not_removed,or tsiolkovsky or goddard
space,not_removed,yup he promises so much and has way too much on his plate hes unlikely to hit his tesla quotas along with his gigabattery quotas
space,not_removed,maybe that came across wrong what i mean is im glad theres two people rich and interested enough that have done this its a collosal financial boost for spacex which im more interested in than two guys getting a sight seeing trip around the moon thanks to them putting money where their mouth is spacex has a new upcoming mission a new opportunity to practise a new launch and to demonstrate to the world that they are a capable and reputable company pushing technology for all of humanity so yeah thats where i stand with this
space,not_removed,imagine what redbull would do
space,not_removed,they would have gopro has been hurting this last year and is being a lot more shy about their advertising budget
space,not_removed,go pro will take moon photage on
space,not_removed,i hope not give those cinematic quality cameras that save the raw video i dont want compressed video
space,not_removed,gopro is part of
space,not_removed,to really sell the authenticity of the fake moon landing we landed on the moon cant have earth gravity giving everything away
space,not_removed,its so crazy it just might work
space,not_removed,oh god imaging what explanations the flat earthers will make up p cant wait
space,not_removed,no its all fake the erth is obviously flat and the sun goes around it and gravity is a lie and onnly happens because the earth is accelerating upwards at meters per seconds s jokes aside theyre a lost cause there are plenty who are just unsure or can be easily convinced but there is no hope for those who still refuse to see the truth despite all of the evidence
space,not_removed,lens distortion that can make half of the worlds oceans and continents disappear no less
space,not_removed,flat earthers are just trolling dont take them seriously
space,not_removed,plus if we can spread out into space mankind would never become extinct my feeling is that once we can launch a new colony strictly using resources from another colonized planet were extinctionproof
space,not_removed,what about the absolutely massive amounts of pressure under the ocean sure its still a mostly closed system whether its on the seafloor or in space but in space you have to deal with atmosphere of pressure whereas on the ocean floor you have to deal with pressures strong enough to
space,not_removed,space definitely does have more space
space,not_removed,this every ≈ meters of water produces as much pressure as our entire atmosphere so if we want to live at a normal atmospheric pressure building a containment chamber anything more than meters below water is dealing with as much differential pressure as one in space and it keeps getting larger as you go down the average depth of the ocean is about meters so the pressure there would be about times that of our atmosphere
space,not_removed,we dont know if permanent colonization of low gravity bodies is possible think of the effects of during pregnancy for instance would the fetus develop would it be born with deformities would pregnancies result in spontaneous abortions can a fetus develop in less than we dont know i know that we still have a lot to learn about the effects of microgravity or zerog on the human body but it really strikes me as incredible that the human body is even anywhere near functional in microgravity for any span of time let alone several months theres obviously effects like decrease in bone mass which we feel but overall the fact that our bodily functions like the digestive system and circulatory system still work is amazingly fortunate
space,not_removed,even moon men have to live a little
space,not_removed,it will be the falcon heavy according to the post
space,not_removed,no it really isnt would send a crew into lunar orbit they would be there for a while longer than just the simple flyby spacex is proposing im behind spacex all the way here but this isnt
space,not_removed,and minus the extreme costs and doing it for like the price that nasa is
space,not_removed,obviously the falcon heavy
space,not_removed,if they beat sls to the punch on circumlunar nasa will be sitting on a lame duck
space,not_removed,these are cubesats you are looking for
space,not_removed,were you trying to rebrand gas
space,not_removed,get the fuck out of here adolph
space,not_removed,i still contend that you did nothing wrong sir
space,not_removed,list price for just a falcon heavy launch is that seems rather low edit httpspacenewscomspacexannouncesplanforcircumlunarhumanmission musk later indicated that the cost of the mission would be on a perperson basis similar or slightly more that a mission to the international space station nasa currently pays a little more than million per soyuz seat for an iss mission sounds more in the ballpark
space,not_removed,i doubt the cost is for an entire new mission to the iss just like the cost of adding an extra body to the list tons of people would pay that heck i would totally pay that if i had at least
space,not_removed,i think they will charge more in the end or accept that this launch will be a financial loss not counting pr
space,not_removed,heinlein basically predicted elon musk with dd harriman
space,not_removed,rfrugal doesnt have free wifi
space,not_removed,look at this fat cat with lentils and beans ive been eating shampoo and mayonnaise for the past month not even old spice im eating generic target shampoo
space,not_removed,indeed this is virgin galactics territory theyre directly competing with and appear to be blowing past if they accomplish this
space,not_removed,yeah virgin galactic and its not doing so hot doubt branson would want to hope a ride on a rival companies maiden voyage not the best optics
space,not_removed,suborbital flight yuge difference
space,not_removed,yes and the last thing i remember hearing about that was that their flight vehicle crashed due to a combination of human and computer error everything ive heard since then about private manned spaceflight has been spacex
space,not_removed,you know they would be fighting for the seat furthest from the earth to claim they were further away
space,not_removed,david gilmour and roger waters performing the ultimate pink floyd the dark side of the moon show
space,not_removed,whats deeper than deep the moon obviously
space,not_removed,titanic ii titanic on the moon
space,not_removed,if hes gonna risk it hell risk it for mars
space,not_removed,can i be the stowaway who shows up episode to provide comic relief and hilarious commentary pretty please
space,not_removed,are you that guy from funny or die who ruined the mars press conference
space,not_removed,id love to see a sitcom with trump and hillaryobama in a dragon
space,not_removed,i hate reality tv but i would watch the hell out of that
space,not_removed,is this speculation or based on something
space,not_removed,they cant go on the same flight too dangerous for humanity to lose that much brainpower if something went wrong god forbid
space,not_removed,guarantee they dont its unprecedented the only other example of crewed first flights is the space shuttle and only because part of the flight required manual control
space,not_removed,yup falcon heavy will probably be flying as soon as this summer at least one side booster is already at mcgregor for its test firing
space,not_removed,it is a difference between allowing someone to climb into a car they designed and race down a salt flat killing themselves and allowing your government pay someone to race down a salt flat in a flimsy car the first is a personal choice of that person on his own risk the second is an imposition of potential risk of death on your employee if spacex was hiring people to fly in a deathtrap then the attitude would be way less positive
space,not_removed,according to the announcement this mission would follow an initial demonstration launch of the falcon heavy and both manned and unmanned missions of dragon to the iss thats a damn sight better than strapping a barely tested orion on top the maiden flight of the sls basically the spacex proposal would be better compared to what nasa was originally planning for in instead of the rush job the administration wants as a publicity boost
space,not_removed,how are they being reckless nasa is talking about flying crew in a capsule that has never flown people before on a rocket that has never flown before spacex is talking about sending two people in a capsule that will have flown at least times before including at least once with crew the rocket they will launch on will have flown at least twice before and shares a large degree of similarity to a rocket that will have flown times before
space,not_removed,spacex will be financially responsible should things go wrong ie reparation to the departeds family if nasa does it then it will be the taxpayers
space,not_removed,that is cargo dragon i believe the crew version needs to be tested in orbit to make sure everything works life support systems and reentry especially nasas orion capsule was similarly in fact the first shuttle was tested like this with only crewmembers it needed crew to
space,not_removed,same i think people have been overly cautious sometimes you just gotta take that leap
space,not_removed,it needs to be basically as safe as normal air travel well no thats a very high standard and onceinalifetime space tourist missions dont need the same level of safety that regular air travel does but yeah it does need to be something other than holy shit this is dangerous which is kinda what space travel is right now
space,not_removed,but the industry here is space tourism not exploration that is a valid point but it isnt guaranteed death merely the risk of it billionaires arent going to spend tens of millions to travel to the moon if theres a significant risk of death that depends on the severity of the risk like explorers most billionaires are risk takers its how they became billionaires in the first place and the ones who would even consider something like space travel would certainly fall into that category it needs to be basically as safe as normal air travel that will never ever happen it logically cant based on the fact that it involves hundreds of tonnes of explosive fuel being ignited very high speeds and gforces through a dense atmosphere and then hoursdaysweeks of operation inside a hostile environment that doesnt support life space travel will never be anywhere near as safe as a mode of transportation where you have the option to design for a quick ejection if necessary and let gravity carry you to safety in minutes
space,not_removed,people that dont work in the industry dont understand that public perception still matters its an industry thats still overwhelmingly funded by government entities regardless of if the company is private or not
space,not_removed,unless thats how they want to take you out
space,not_removed,you must have one hell of a metabolism
space,not_removed,what if theyre related
space,not_removed,i see your point youll be really bored for the remaining minutes and seconds
space,not_removed,thats an interesting thought though while theyre developing the its for martian colonisation could they use it for tourism to the moon to generate revenue
space,not_removed,and then there have been years since the last landing and now technology is improving but space seems to be in a lull maybe donald wants a new cold war to spark the space race again s
space,not_removed,well that guy invented brexit not earthxit james cameron will be more likely when it comes to cameras
space,not_removed,its crazy how much less we have to spend
space,not_removed,thats a healthy attitude we should all have we should all want for there to be great advances and be excited about the prospects on the other hand we should not trust claims explicitly and question how they intend to achieve these goals its a mindset scientists are very familiar with
space,not_removed,id say the apollo anniversary would be more apt december im sure its crossed their minds
space,not_removed,tesla is spacex is not presumably to insulate it from failures relating to single launches
space,not_removed,i think it sets unrealistic goals to push engineers as hard as they can which is why his companies have a high turnover rate thousands of engineers want to work for spacex but very few can handle the intense workload and stress levels
space,not_removed,i worked in supply chain under which was now is managed under production came in with zero aerospace experience from the automotive industry working conditions were brutal worked over hours last year pay was low incentives were very low leadership was terrible high turnover in mid level the building i spent most of my time in was decrepit no climate control lead paint falling everywhere and my division turnover was over yearly constant state of training new hires there was good food decent healthcare and the people i worked with for the most part were interestingcool folks
space,not_removed,actually on that topic the peeps working on the mars rovers had to live their daily lives on mars time theres a minute difference so every day theyd come into work mins later than the day before until theyre starting work at midnight pretty interesting talk here httpswwwtedcomtalksnagincoxwhattimeisitonmars
space,not_removed,they also put dscovr into earthsun which i think is more than the dv numbers for geo
space,not_removed,exactly unless spacex intends to set up relays so that ground crew can control the capsule itll need someone on board who can take over if it goes pear shaped who knows though maybe the passengers are already astronauts who just really with theyd been on the apollo program
space,not_removed,so youre moving the goal posts
space,not_removed,hard landing is still landing critical failure but landing
space,not_removed,were going to skydive all the way from the moon redbull gives you wings
space,not_removed,it would be like felix baumgartner but he just from the dark side of the moon
space,not_removed,theyd slingshot around the moon an parachute to the lunar surface wait
space,not_removed,a gopro on da moon is good marketing home skillet
space,not_removed,i imagine this is just the advertising they need and literally all they need to do is run a couple ads and give them a camera or two
space,not_removed,well they could technically just shoot one of their cameras into space on a hobby rocket if they really wanted to
space,not_removed,they are probably hurting because anyone in the market for a camera like that already has one and the incremental upgrades of each version isnt enough for people with gen gopros to upgrade
space,not_removed,the main thing would be unpacking the moon barren surface cartboard background on the moon and acting up with the flag in front of it
space,not_removed,is that accelerating upwards thing actually what they believe
space,not_removed,agreed you could fly them up on a to see the black of space and curvature of the earth for themselves and they would claim that you faked it by manipulating the cockpit glass
space,not_removed,its true though my family went on a cruise last year they accidentally fell right off the earth into space rip edit or one of the monsters got them first were not sure but seriously people can be fucking stupid
space,not_removed,because light bends and looses power same reason why the sun only works on part of the earth at the same time
space,not_removed,more like extinction resistant but yeah
space,not_removed,until the relay is discovered and the reapers return sure
space,not_removed,wed need to be in multiple systems and very far apart to really be extinctionproof
space,not_removed,in that case goodbye moonmen
space,not_removed,all the moon men want things their way but we make sure they see the sun
space,not_removed,yea just saw that too im thinking it will be the third or fourth falcon heavy to launch
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,whats amazing is that these people are paying spacex instead of nasa employees
space,not_removed,nasa is only so expensive due to having to fulfill contracts in each states for jobs if allowed to plan and build with their budget theyd do amazing things beyond whay they do now but sadly jobs for congressmen are more important
space,not_removed,not really it will steal their spotlight but the sls and the orion are larger that their spacex rivals the orion is intended for long duration missions including to mars whereas musk has said he wouldnt want to send a crew to mars in a dragon since they are too small
space,not_removed,it prussian blue my socks off
space,not_removed,most likely spacex is subsidising the flightthey want to fly the flight and need some money do they sell tickets to pay for some of it
space,not_removed,youre forgetting that the falcon heavy is reusable
space,not_removed,nasa pay per body on soyuz and if nasa is not paying then roscosmos puts the seat up for auction if spacex takes for a trip to the moon that would be in the ballpark of their other published prices
space,not_removed,i think its reasonable for them to take a loss on a maiden moon voyage the financial benefits to their brand would be enormous
space,not_removed,thats the only kind of wifi they have when the timer runs out at mcdonalds they move to the plasma donation place sell plasma and get paid while browsing reddit
space,not_removed,virgin galactic has never even made orbit
space,not_removed,two private citizens edit
space,not_removed,i dont think theyre really competitors theyre competing with blue origin for suborbital spacex is skipping leo and is going straight to the freakin moon let that set in
space,not_removed,there is no dark side of the moon really matter of fact its all dark the only thing that makes it look light is the sun ﻿
space,not_removed,he talked about it during one of the interviews on stage hes not going anywhere cause he considers himself too important and isnt sure would others be able to properly follow in his footsteps if he died in such an accident
space,not_removed,you can but you will only be in a handful of episodes and must somehow depart before the return trip home
space,not_removed,you can but you have to be a highly evolved cathuman
space,not_removed,it was ruined well before the funnyordie guy came along to piss on its grave
space,not_removed,no being out of radio contact because were on the far side of the moon means that your tweets wont go through just then no donald you cant just open the door
space,not_removed,theres reality tv and theres actually real docustyle short filmmaking id see it more as the ultimate travel vlog or like the ultimate youtube sailboat cruising vlog
space,not_removed,both speculation based on the two people going on the trip who werent named already know each other and the fact that elon musk and larry page are friends
space,not_removed,i understand what youre saying i am not sharing a fan theory with you just describing what masa just said they were investigating because it sounds like you and missed the story
space,not_removed,this here comment dun got itself overwrote
space,not_removed,also at that point the crew dragon will have flown and tested several times the nasa mission is part of the testing process for the capsule and it will still be experimental i am not sure how they would be able to list it as crew certified with only the one short test they did several years ago
space,not_removed,i mean lets be really really honest here nobody accidentally gets on a nasa space mission you have to pretty much commit years of if not your entire life towards the goal of being on a space mission anyone who goes on one knows the risks im not saying i dont like the new attitude towards space travel that nasa has adopted in recent decades but i think its a little disingenuous to imply that going on a governmentsponsored space mission is any less of a personal choice than going on a private one and in both cases its virtually impossible for anyone to fully understand the entire machine
space,not_removed,agreed so much every new exploration from across the mountain to across the ocean to the first time in outer space was a huge leap that humanity had no way of knowing what was on the other side i want us as people in general to have that fire again we are way too cozy anymore
space,not_removed,i completely disagree with your last point i think in the distant future if we really invest and expand our civilization into space it will become as safe as air travel or at least close after weve been doing it every day for hundreds of years we will have more efficient and safe technology if there are a lot of people and ships and stations in space and your engine goes out you wont just drift into the abyss and die youd be rescued i wish we were at this point but we arent i hope i live long enough to see medical advances that extend human lives by hundreds of years because i would love to leave this planet and explore our little corner of the universe
space,not_removed,what happens in orbit stays in orbit
space,not_removed,then they should at least be courteous and look the other way and put in some earbuds while each of them rubs one out
space,not_removed,no one else ever needs to find out
space,not_removed,they would put their name in the history books worth more than any mansion
space,not_removed,yes the its system as is for mars is capable of round trips to the moon with the same architecture but no need for refueling after the initial top off in low earth orbit cargo capacity in addition to the vehicle itself would be possibly tonnes which is still a lot the entire apollo lunar module total was tonnes if they also topped off a second tanker and sent both to lunar orbit one its ship could land tonnes on the moon at that point youre talking about realistic scale to build a base on the back of this system
space,not_removed,potentially theres pipe dreams of creating resorts on the moon if theres the the demand and enough people with the money then it could be a very profitable revenue stream for space tourism itd also give spacex a way to refine their lander whilst still generating income
space,not_removed,its crazy how much we can do once people start funding them again
space,not_removed,its so full control of the company can be maintained spacex is elons real baby
space,not_removed,those types of companies are also look great on a resume endure a few years of hell and basically guarantee that a lower tier organization will hire you for more money
space,not_removed,thats true though dscovr was very lightweight large geostationary satellites are much closer in weight to a dragon
space,not_removed,sorry redbull i dont think thats how gravity works
space,not_removed,it wont be on the moon the mission is a flyby
space,not_removed,while true if any other video company wants in on the moonpie then there starts a very expensive bidding war
space,not_removed,i think they generally like to explain gravity by density stuff like wood floating disproves gravity to them and shows that only density matters of course this completely ignores that for some reason all these different densities sit on the bottom or fall to the bottom of the stuff theyre denser than
space,not_removed,ill consider us extinctionproof once theres a colony beyond our light cone still not certain but thered always be hope
space,not_removed,or intergalactic nuclear war which sounds pretty sweet
space,not_removed,ah yes reapers the immortal race of sentient starships allegedly waiting in dark space we have dismissed this claim
space,not_removed,captain shepard will definitely save the day tho
space,not_removed,oh hi morty im krombopulos michael im an assassin i buy guns from your grandpa listen if ya ever need anybody murdered please give me a call i have no code of ethics i will kill anyone anywhere children animals old people doesnt matter i just love killin
space,not_removed,shut the fuurrrrpuck up about moonmen
space,not_removed,on top of or steel balls
space,not_removed,oh yeah for sure i was assuming the discussion was about a manned otherwise would be a better comparison
space,not_removed,you work on what do you do
space,not_removed,as a professional can you speak intelligently as to why they would crew it knowing through safety culture of nasa those sounds like an unnecessary risk on an as yet unproven platform
space,not_removed,and spacex will use the money to develop more stuff and plus they get the data from this flight if they pull this one off i guarantee there will be at least yearly manned tourist flights after this
space,not_removed,well nasa isnt going to the moon much these days
space,not_removed,thats what helps keep nasa alive in congress though lyndon johnson was no dummy
space,not_removed,nobody is going to mars in an orion capsule they might go out to or an neo asteroid
space,not_removed,this is what i was thinking the people going arent paying for the entire mission they are more or less just reducing the cost so the mission can happen this would be amazeballs for spacexs future to get their name plastered on this event
space,not_removed,the list price is for the reusable version
space,not_removed,considering the only craft theyve tested so far spaceshiptwo is a suborbital craft that was never designed to enter orbit thats kinda to be expected they have a second craft launcherone which is meant to launch satellites into orbit from a aircraft that is supposed to start testing this year
space,not_removed,obama doesnt have the money
space,not_removed,theyre not skipping leo dragon would fly humans to iss before this happens
space,not_removed,i do that with my kerbals but we always end up stranded with no fuel orbiting whatever object caught us usually the sun
space,not_removed,interesting does that mean that night time is a lie and its really just day time but without the sun shining on us
space,not_removed,there was a dark side of the moon that which is unknown is in the dark we have seen the dark side and the dark side is no more
space,not_removed,hey guys you should all use my rockets they are super safe and awesome are you going in one uh yeah no theyre super dangerous
space,not_removed,now put on this special red uniform and investigate that strange noise coming from the air lock
space,not_removed,i feel like when youre rich enough to afford a literal trip around the moon you probably know almost everyone who is also that rich so thats not really great evidence imo
space,not_removed,i feel like its going to be a husband and wife
space,not_removed,theres no way google would let them both go up
space,not_removed,im aware just virtually certain the result will be not happening
space,not_removed,masa make america space again
space,not_removed,its totally unprecedented to do it without being absolutely necessary
space,not_removed,we are way too cozy anymore this in the next decade we are probably going to have a freaking colony on mars i dont know about you but sometimes i stare at the night sky and wish we could do more to conquer this vast unknown territory of the cosmos
space,not_removed,i want to be on one of the mars missions if i know its an chance of getting blown up ill still sign up
space,not_removed,all that zerog jizz would be nightmare
space,not_removed,unless there is a greater force
space,not_removed,internet got an answer for everything
space,not_removed,except ground control theyll know they know everything
space,not_removed,in space no one can hear you moan
space,not_removed,history books ask the random stranger who was the first iss space tourist our the fifth
space,not_removed,yeah it definitely has appeal to some im sure you get a ton of good experience in those first few years to help your career and if you are going to work extreme hours the best time to do it is when you are fresh with no family obligations personally i knew or classmates who interned at spacex who got full time offers and all of them chose to work elsewhere due to the worklife balance
space,not_removed,you totally could do that just gotta kill all your lateral velocity so instead of staying in orbit you just fall straight down to earth might take a while though
space,not_removed,a free online lottery where people can win a chance to remote control a camera would likely be worth the expense in public engagement nasa could pay to put one aboard and have it be a public education program
space,not_removed,yea i think a big name like sony would win out in an attempt to dethrone gopro
space,not_removed,i weigh pounds and a large cloud weighs a million pounds it stays up in the sky while i sink to the earth because i am much more dense actual gravity is density argument i saw on a youtube video
space,not_removed,no some actually explain gravity as acceleration its sad
space,not_removed,well once we can confirm whether the entire universe is going to exist forever
space,not_removed,i am the harbinger of your ascension
space,not_removed,thats commander shepard to you
space,not_removed,oh boy here i go killing again
space,not_removed,pssh everyone knows theres only whalers on the moon
space,not_removed,well the first men to orbit the moon were on appears to have been the third launch of saturn v
space,not_removed,waiting with extreme anticipation blue balls
space,not_removed,and if they dont
space,not_removed,with a billion bidding war over who gets it i can already see rich princes fighting over the privilege
space,not_removed,will they be doing any science experiments or just taking selfies while up there
space,not_removed,they really need to hire someone to come up with better names
space,not_removed,nope its day time thats a lie its just night time with an extra light bulb
space,not_removed,wheres darth vader when you need him this dark side stuff sheesh
space,not_removed,i think the act of going to space is inherently dangerous
space,not_removed,it was funny seeing him talk about it uh you have to uhh itits theres a chance youll youll not make it must have been really strange explaining how someone has to go willingly with a high chance of death in order to advance the technology
space,not_removed,well if you can go to mars and possibly die and everyone will still be able to go to mars occasionally thats great and all but if you can make rockets to get to mars and get people to mars for a while and then make rockets to get to jupiter and stuff then thats definitely better it is a bit odd but spaceprogramleads are rare resources the ussrs space program lost almost all of its forward momentum with the death of korolev if spacex wants to ensure musks survival against unforseen rocketry accidents they are totally making the right choice
space,not_removed,a space porn odyssey
space,not_removed,plz be porn stars that would be so funny
space,not_removed,perhaps and any other year i would agree with you but gestures generally at the last few months remindme years how crazy did things get with sls
space,not_removed,youre damn right i do i went back to school after a few years away to get my physics degree and hopefully a phd right after
space,not_removed,in the next decade we are probably going to have a freaking colony on mars as much as i want this to be true lets be realistic
space,not_removed,it gets lonely in space armstrong really proved his namesake
space,not_removed,well technically the back side of the moon is in radio silence due the large piece of rock between you and the earth not going to say i condone interfamilial relations but the physics says theyre pretty isolated
space,not_removed,dont get me wrong the iss is cool but being the first private citizen on the moon is orders of magnitude more notable imo especially considering theyd be the first person on the moon in decades whereas iss travel was relatively routine by the time the first tourist visited the iss
space,not_removed,maybe they could assist the fall by putting them in some sort of container that helped speed up the process
space,not_removed,i did it on kerbal space program it didnt work out too well for jebediah
space,not_removed,how long would it take to reach the earth freefalling from the moons orbital path
space,not_removed,i can see one sly mofo operating thousands of bots and winning the lottery from their mothers basement edit grammar
space,not_removed,from the moon shot by iphone
space,not_removed,i am much more dense i couldnt have phrased it better if i tried
space,not_removed,for anyone reading this who doesnt know clouds stay aloft because of updrafts a column of air forces them upwards when updrafts are present no updrafts no clouds except of course if the humidity is high enough on the ground that clouds can form there which is known as fog and also throws a giant wrench in that videos argument
space,not_removed,i wonder does that mean they dont accept that the speed of light is a thing how do you explain what happens once youve accelerated to that point
space,not_removed,oh sweet can we reach escape velocity by pushing a rocket off the edge of the flat earth then these people are crazy
space,not_removed,bad news it wont unless entropy can be reversed
space,not_removed,this always bugged me in the games naval tradition is the commanding officer of a ship is referred to as captain or skipper no matter what their rank is technically he should be called captain shepard even though he is a commander in rank
space,not_removed,do they carry a harpoon
space,not_removed,im so happy i read into this thread
space,not_removed,yeah and considering the flight before had vibrationinduced engine failures thanks to broken fuel lines id say the apollo crew had a large degree of testicular fortitude as well
space,not_removed,whats heavier and harder than steel
space,not_removed,doing it while male modeling blue steel balls
space,not_removed,im currently doing a year in computer science focusing on computer vision but i want to do something to help push humanity into space do you have any advice for someone like me is computer vision a good area to continue in if i want to work for nasa or more likely a private company involved in space travel
space,not_removed,well have two rich people who have purchased the most expensive and epic funeral in human history
space,not_removed,best assisted suicide ever achieved
space,not_removed,then private space exploration fails to move forward for another decade sadlydepending on the failure
space,not_removed,then thatll still be true only therell be a decadelong gap in between
space,not_removed,its going to be two pornstars flying on pornhubs dime to make the first ever porn in space a pornhub exclusive edit i just typed porn so many times
space,not_removed,they are like me in kerbal space program when im out of ideas for names
space,not_removed,considering elon musk named his tunnel bore company the boring company id say virgin galactic are doing pretty well
space,not_removed,hello darkness my old friend
space,not_removed,yeah it doesnt matter how much the technology progresses weve had boats for thousands of years and while its much safer theres always a risk its hard to alleviate the risk without taking chances getting messy and making mistakes
space,not_removed,a rocket on earth is safe but thats not what rockets are for
space,not_removed,i think there would be plenty of very well qualified people ready to take a chance to be the first human to step foot on mars
space,not_removed,thank you for the best laugh of the week
space,not_removed,wasnt pornhub trying to finance a porno in space awhile back edit yup
space,not_removed,nasa astronauts ordered to claim moon as sovereign us territory russia preparing to expand its nuclear arsenal to include moon in planetary annihilation scenario
space,not_removed,dont we have stuff at the moons that lets us maintain radio contact
space,not_removed,around the moon not on the moon also this is celebrity cool not historybooks cool do you remember the name of the first rich guy after columbus whod be comparable to the apollo missions to have purchased a tourist ticket to the west indies
space,not_removed,at its closest the moon is from earth lets assume that through some technique youre travelling from the moon at a skydivers terminal velocity it would take you about days
space,not_removed,his name the hacker formerly known as
space,not_removed,im just here to let you know that i laughed longer than i have at any other point today so thank you for that
space,not_removed,actually you can maintain a constant acceleration as long as you have the energy to do so but due to relativistic effects you never end up travelling faster than light so really the question should be where the fuck do they think earth gets the energy to continually accelerate upwards at magic edit also we would see the effects of this the stars would contract in length and get increasingly blueshifted as we accelerated towards them
space,not_removed,i mean the speed of light is pretty unrelatable to people who dont specifically dabble in physics i doubt thats even a consideration really id be surprised if any of them ever did something as fundamental to the theory of relativity as a lorentz transformation at any point really
space,not_removed,no great atuin will swallow it
space,not_removed,gimme a few million years and ill come up with a good answer for that problem
space,not_removed,httpmultivaxcomlastquestionhtml
space,not_removed,yup but there aint no whales so they tell tall tales and sing a whaling tune
space,not_removed,httpsyoutubefzcsdvfpqqk gives me the chills every time i see it
space,not_removed,testicular fortitude new band name called it
space,not_removed,honestly the most impressive feat was that they were able to fit testicles of that size into the spaceship at all
space,not_removed,tungsten carbide
space,not_removed,but why male models
space,not_removed,ya know not so bad actually
space,not_removed,i mean you cant bring it with you and it is a pretty epic way to go out pharaohs had pyramids built for their funerals like peasants these two might potentially have their funeral among the stars
space,not_removed,modern viking funerals are so expensive these days
space,not_removed,taking inflation into account i would imagine enslaving thousands of people and have giant pyramids built is more expensive
space,not_removed,government regulation being the thing that kills it if i had the money i would still do it even if the people before me died its a rocket they will never be safe
space,not_removed,that would instantly become the most pirated video on earth
space,not_removed,ive been eagerly edging waiting for this for so long
space,not_removed,a zerogravity money shot could happen from across the room
space,not_removed,today i learned even in this day and age a legend can be born to be the first man to film a porno in space
space,not_removed,id sign up for pornhub premium for this i dunno if id keep it still have no idea what premium nets ya but if it helped fund space travel id be down
space,not_removed,spaceship spaceship spaceship spaceship
space,not_removed,yup i often follow the thingitdoesmkx probelauncher mannedorbiter blows up not enough struts mannedorbiter
space,not_removed,to be fair the boring company is a fucking awesome name
space,not_removed,has he done anything with that enterprise yet
space,not_removed,please let this be a normal space trip
space,not_removed,i know that there is a zerog cumshot out there because i saw it i think it was done on a plane in parabolic flight though
space,not_removed,the moon has held a referendum and has decided to join the russian federation of planets
space,not_removed,get out of here with your logical thinking fuck of with our fanticies
space,not_removed,someone should jump off the moon with a tracking device and see how far they get while some form of a space shuttle follows
space,not_removed,and maybe some kind of device that makes you not burn up when entering the atmosphere
space,not_removed,something to shield them from the heat of reentry might be helpful too
space,not_removed,okay but terminal velocity is highest velocity attainable by an object as it falls through air thats not going to apply for a large part of the trip
space,not_removed,impressive took the universal ac til past the end of the universe to figure it out
space,not_removed,thank you fellow traveler
space,not_removed,futurama was a whale of a show
space,not_removed,i love each and every one of you
space,not_removed,oh gods i used to sing that daily for hours now i officially relapsed
space,not_removed,now rich chinese and saudis are doing it for the lulz
space,not_removed,tungsten testes has a certain ring
space,not_removed,either way its a win win really
space,not_removed,the barge can be located in international waters
space,not_removed,probably the most pirated off earth too
space,not_removed,hopefully itll be included in the spacex history museum
space,not_removed,and propel yourself backwards puttputtputt
space,not_removed,id pay to see that video just for the money shot and uh science and what not
space,not_removed,born too late to explore the world born too early to explore the galaxy born just in time to bang hot chicks in zero g
space,not_removed,actually no one has ever had sex in space as far as im aware if you think about it why would any highly trained astronauts bang one out when they are likely being recorded add in its a male dominanted field and its very possible edit did a little research no official sex in space a total of women have been in space from america
space,not_removed,the virgin galactic asdsdf is going to be amazing
space,not_removed,he dug a hole in the spacex hq car park
space,not_removed,with the musk no way
space,not_removed,could you provide a source for your outrageous claim i ask purely for science as i myself am above such things for pleasure
space,not_removed,proportionally the oceans are just a very thin film of water oceans are many thousands of kilometers across but only a couple of kilometers deep imagine it more like a layer of paint
space,not_removed,this is a good representation of how the volume of a sphere scales it looks likes the diameter of the large sphere im guessing large is all the salt water and small is all the fresh is about half the width of the usa which is about across volume of a sphere with diameter km is liters wolfram alpha lists volume of the oceans as
space,not_removed,the key is the comparison to earth earths radius is about miles the deepest parts of the oceans are about miles so even if the entire earth had water miles deep not just the ocean parts but including the continents thats still so of the radius of earth would be water volume is cubic so that magnifies the difference in size as we can see
space,not_removed,i heard the comparison one time that if the earth were the size of a globe the distance from the tip of everest to the lowest point of the marianas trench would only be as tall as peaks and valleys of your fingerprints didnt do any math to see if it worked out but it at least puts the general topography of earth and thus the amount of water on earth into a scale that can be easily understood
space,not_removed,the picture is a bit misleading but accurate its hard to show exactly how big the ball of water how many miles the circumference is is in relation to the earth the picture originates from the usgsgov website with other information here httpwaterusgsgoveduearthhowmuchhtml
space,not_removed,isnt there more water at the bottom on the ocean per cubic meter than at the top due to the immense pressure
space,not_removed,the file name of the image explains why the drop is so small its only fresh water
space,not_removed,when talking to non geek people i liken it to the orange layer on top of an orange being thicker that the earths biosphere with most plants and animals living in a single layer of cells on the top surface
space,not_removed,this image does such a fantastic job of slowing not only how a sphere scales but also how finite our water resources really are its a great render because the first time people see it they always question something and that inevitably builds knowledge
space,not_removed,yeah big is salt water small is fresh underground tiny is fresh on surface
space,not_removed,if the earth were the size of a cue ball it would be smoother than a cue ball
space,not_removed,mount everest ′ mariana trench ′ total miles as a fraction of the earths diameter move that fraction to a foot diameter globe inches millimeters so pretty close but a bit larger than your fingerprint a bit thicker than a dime
space,not_removed,water is basically incompressible so even though there is a lot of pressure the volume doesnt change
space,not_removed,that is incorrect big ball is salt water small ball is fresh water underground and in glaciers tiny ball is fresh water on the surface so wanna try again it even made the oceans sand to show you that it was all the water on earth how did you miss that did you even look at the picture
space,not_removed,or that the earth an all its mountains and trenches is still much smoother than a regulation cue ball
space,not_removed,isnt the vast majority of water recycled over and over finite water is only a problem if we capture a lot of water permanently in nonwater substances or move it off the planet
space,not_removed,it does change but very very slightly we assume incompressibility in calculations because it makes things a lot less complex
space,not_removed,water is basically incompressible you can only compress the gases in water this is why divers surfacing too fast are in danger of nitrogen bubbles forming in their blood
space,not_removed,that has nothing to do with compression and everything to do with solubility
space,not_removed,i used to be in fire sprinkler installations and the water after a pressure test is carbonated swamp water the above comment was the way the journeymen would explain it to us apprentices
space,not_removed,maybe not us maybe not tomorrow but some day people will go there as much as i hate some facets of mankind i fully trust our ability and capability to be better and one day reach out to the stars i have no good reason why we just have to
space,not_removed,please share the original link by creator erik wernquist instead
space,not_removed,here is the original video in better quality
space,not_removed,he also made for new horizons
space,not_removed,ive watched this like times it really makes me wish everyone had this mindset
space,not_removed,nobody of us can really imagine this kind of scenario to be real but i have the felling that we are on a good way
space,not_removed,neat video thats amy adams in man of steel at the end man i hope they crack the whole ageing thing soon id love to see some of this stuff
space,not_removed,i feel the same way but with the way weve been treating the earth sometimes im scared we wont survive long enough to make it to that point
space,not_removed,if only we can manage not to self implode before then between climate issues and general geopolitical instability has been a bit grim the whole turkey really kind of blew my mind its amazing how an event be fabricated in an effort to tighten up religious control its some charles foster kane level shit thats possible in the media right now and so many things are just a powder keg waiting to explode
space,not_removed,and this sick music video for one of jamie xxs songs
space,not_removed,ah was wondering why theyd depict an astronaut wearing heavy makeup
space,not_removed,tbh i just cant see us not having another world war before we actually start working together on space and rights and stuff depressing really
space,not_removed,as long as long as we have property we will always have reasons to fight as long as there are rich and poor we will always have a reason to rebell
space,not_removed,in all likelihood its probably not a supernova star at least not one in the milky way if a star were to go supernova in the milky way right now the visual effect would last far longer to us than that theres only been three recorded supernovae in human history so far and each one was a pretty large event for its time the next supernova we may see would be betelgeuse and that going supernova would temporarily be brighter than the sun im not entirely sure but there may be a chance it is the light of a supernova in another galaxy finally reaching earth or something entirely else anyone feel free to correct me if im wrong
space,not_removed,im gonna say iridium flare post your location and time perhaps someone can track down if it was a satellite and which one
space,not_removed,for info what is brighter a supernova at the location of the sun or a hydrogen bomb detonated against your eyeball
space,not_removed,check heavensabovecom put in your location and you can search for iridium flares that happened in the past hours or so
space,not_removed,if you were in turkey i would say that is sirius but i dont have a answer for your question my friend
space,not_removed,if it were a supernova it would stay at about the same brightness throughout the night and would be visible for weeks or months also it would be front page news as there hasnt been one in our galaxy visible to the naked eye in years its probably an iridium flare or aircraft
space,not_removed,not a supernova they dont come and go like that iridium flare most likely
space,not_removed,i really hope someone can give some good info on what this might be now i have oasis stuck in my head
space,not_removed,whats so significant about all the supernovas of human time
space,not_removed,it was around pm just outside of calgary alberta
space,not_removed,such a better song than that wonderwall crap
space,not_removed,significant in the sense that it would be an extremely bright spot in the sky visible even during the day time it could last for months before it faded out
space,not_removed,there was an iridium flare at pm
space,not_removed,that must be terrifyingly beautiful
space,not_removed,i couldnt even imaginei just hope that one day before i die i get to see something that spectacular
space,not_removed,to reduce the loads on the wings during assent it doesnt use its wings on the way up only for landing but theyre still there of course so there will be some lift and drag created they factored this in when designing the shuttle and realized that having the orbiter underneath the stack while in the lower atmosphere will minimize the forces on the vehicle the geometry of air flow and everything works out better that way before they reach orbit but are out of the atmosphere they actually roll back up to have better antenna orientation for tracking and communications
space,not_removed,this was part of a report i wrote on the shuttle at university there were several reasons that they changed from heads up to heads down fairly late in design which is why i assume they had to turn around in flight rather than having the shuttle in the right orientation on the pad communications as someone else has said to reduce stress on the wings simulations showed that the wings would be overstressed and the control surfaces at the back could be damaged this was caused by an interaction between the flows around the wings and the solid rocket boosters at supersonic or transonic ikr speeds the effect was reduced in later revisions of the boosters so after a certain launch they didnt need to but so much training and so much stuff was built around the heads down launch and there is very little difference in efficiencies of either launch that they didnt change training simulations with the astronauts with them flying heads up had them struggle with anything needing a visual horizon which was essentially impossible in a heads up takeoff
space,not_removed,another reason i believe is to create positive gee forces ive heard that if the shuttle flew right side up the astronauts would all lose consciousness from the negative gees i read an incorrect forum post which was later corrected excuse the misinformation
space,not_removed,i never understood why they did not roll it out of the vab already aligned to the position required to fly upside down but instead rolled it after launch i would think this introduces unnecessary complexity
space,not_removed,i dont understand your phrasing are you asking why does the space shuttle appear to fly upside down that is because it orbits upside down the under side is much stronger and resistant to impact so the shuttle orbits upside down
space,not_removed,thank you for explanation
space,not_removed,if youre interested in the details a study on how to not rip the orbiter wings off during launch httpswwwaiaaorguploadedfilesaboutaiaahistoryandheritagefinalspaceshuttlelauncheswhythewingsstayonpdf i also have a pdf somewhere that was a study of how much additional payload could be gained by flying an alternative heads up profile if i find a link to it ill post it here
space,not_removed,the space shuttle rocket engines also point towards the center of mass if it was the other way around it would just flip
space,not_removed,are you accounting for the curve in the spacecrafts ascent profile
space,not_removed,there is no discussion in that of air density which falls off quite rapidly dropping to of that at the surface by feet
space,not_removed,the center of mass is constantly changing as it is being consumed
space,not_removed,that is called a httpsenwikipediaorgwikigravityturn and does not result in the astronauts feeling any lateral force
space,not_removed,no not all stars are in a galaxy they may have once belonged to a galaxy but they are not a part of it any more some of these socalled stellar outcasts or intergalactic stars have actually been observed by nasas hubble space telescope in other words they are truly intergalactic or between galaxies
space,not_removed,slightly off topic but imagine what the sky space would look like from the vantage point of an intergalactic star i bet itd be pretty cool
space,not_removed,an intergalactic star also known as a rogue star is a star not gravitationally bound to a galaxy httpsenwikipediaorgwikiintergalacticstar
space,not_removed,just like there are rogue planets there are rogue stars gravitational interactions can throw things out of their original orbits stars are no different
space,not_removed,perhaps rogue planets and the like but typically no at least thats what i think
space,not_removed,wow i had never heard of this phenomenon before it must be so lonely
space,not_removed,or better yet a rogue planet zero light pollution
space,not_removed,assuming you are in the shadow of some orbiting object like an asteroid or a planet you would see nearby galaxies but unless one of them is very close most of the sky would look pitch black
space,not_removed,wouldnt they still be able to see stars
space,not_removed,every single star we see in the night sky is in our own galaxy if you plopped our solar system between galaxies the sky would not have stars in it we might see some fluffs if we were near any large galaxies but no individual stars
space,not_removed,so you run and you run to catch up with the sun but its sinking racing around to come up behind you again
space,not_removed,its years old the same age it would be if it stayed on earth the time difference due to changes in gravity would be less than a second
space,not_removed,he knows he still wants to know hence the point of a question
space,not_removed,if this didnt say mars and wasnt on rspace id honestly think that it was arizona or some shit its kind of scary
space,not_removed,the rover should be careful the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly
space,not_removed,this absolutely blows my mind i mean this is literally mars its amazing to think how far weve come or gone
space,not_removed,i think these images are very underappreciated is practically quality from a plant that is a speck in the sky social media has ruined us where are these images in my news feed why aint the press talking about them i will appreciate them and the hard work people have put to get us this far god bless the human race
space,not_removed,usually i see mars shots where the colors are all whacked out the sky red etc not sure if this is coloraccurate but its sure believable based on color spectrums im used to here on terra firma
space,not_removed,sometimes i cant believe we have a robot on mars cant wait til spacex sends people
space,not_removed,im taking a shit in a bathroom at a gas station looking at mars on the safe device i use to watch people fuck
space,not_removed,a lot of people are going to look at this and think hey thats neat and go on to the next thing if youre one of those people i want you to look at this full screen sit back and understand that this is a real actual picture taken on a completely different planet than the one we are all on
space,not_removed,a bit of an off topic question but whats the most valuable thing we can possibly find on mars besides water actually whats the most valuable thing we can find on any other planet
space,not_removed,has there ever been an ama with thea person at nasa that creates these photo mosaics id love to learn how they process the raw images
space,not_removed,the sand people are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers
space,not_removed,whatever not fooling me i know tatooine when i see it okay nasa
space,not_removed,anyone else realise how lucky we are to live on earth these other planets are actually pretty boring we live on such an incredible and diverse planet
space,not_removed,thats the most sunlight i think ive ever seen in a picture of the mars surface
space,not_removed,incredible to think we have a man made machine on another planet just casually taking snaps and sending them back to earth like fuck me
space,not_removed,you can kinda see lines of erosion as well which makes it even cooler
space,not_removed,someday soon there may be buildings right there so crazy to think whats to come
space,not_removed,bullshit my cousin randy took that picture in nevada when we went out to the desert to shoot propane tanks
space,not_removed,the scale of this photo is extremely confusing it has infinite depth of field or something how many meters are we seeing from the bottom to the horizon and how far along that traverse is the scale graphic supposed to indicate i feel like im looking at a geological equivalent of the hubble ultra deep field
space,not_removed,this is the first mars image that has made me think wow were going to live there
space,not_removed,picture in higher resolution without the meter bar
space,not_removed,for those hills to be rounded and those sublayers of rock to be darkened does that mean there could have been water there at some point
space,not_removed,it just blows my mind that this is an image of a landscape on another planet millions of miles from here
space,not_removed,said to my girlfriend that picture was taken on mars so she responded its frustrated me for a moment that she couldnt comprehend what it took to take a picture of this quality on another planet
space,not_removed,amazing photographs like this leave the viewer with no choice but to see mars as an actual place
space,not_removed,how would this feel to walk on compared to earth i know there is some gravity difference but im not sure how much or how the ground feels either
space,not_removed,ok ok ok someone turn it into a gif with a couple moving pixels and freak some people out
space,not_removed,im convinced that mars was a blue planet you know with massive amounts of water much like earth
space,not_removed,this has been the most eye opening picture of mars yet to me its really made mars more real to me if that makes any sense
space,not_removed,is this image whitecorrected it looks like it must be the martian sky is usually more caramelcoloured
space,not_removed,this is the first image of mars that had me thinking yeah we need to go there
space,not_removed,i see this picture and all i can think is god damn i want to live there its hard to explain to people who dont feel it but those of us who do understand it goes beyond a yearning every fiber of my being is drawn to that planet it seems silly but even though i was born in missouri i look at that picture and it feels like im seeing a picture of home
space,not_removed,had to stop and realize i was looking at a landscape picture of another bloody planet far too often have i taken these otherworldly photos for granted it amazes me just thinking about the technological feat it took to launch the rover from earth to mars and the process to transmit the image back to us
space,not_removed,the very idea that human beings are advanced enough to propel a vehicle to the surface of mars and have that vehicle capture a digital image with this kind of clarity which is then transmitted back to our home planet is astonishing completely mindblowing
space,not_removed,i know its obvious but im going to say it anyway we are looking at a picture taken from another planet that is amazing
space,not_removed,i think a lot of people are like yeah meh whatever because this really looks like the old plain earth it could be arizona everybody would care if it looked like so lets photoshop the hell out of this pic and cash right away
space,not_removed,what is with the extra dark band at the bottom under the scale bar it looks like standing water to me
space,not_removed,i used to bullseye womp rats in my back home theyre not much bigger than two meters
space,not_removed,mars looks like southern nevada minus plants i feel like humans could actually live there some day we are a highly adaptive species and a place like the cold desert of mars isnt that different than some places on earth except for you know oxygen and life
space,not_removed,when i see photos like these i cant help but wonder how amazing it would be if we could take them backwards in time and show people like galileo what their scientific contributions would one day lead to imagine their reactions
space,not_removed,bot beep beep im all about top posts this post had upvotes and got posted to twitter and subreddit the tweet all upvotes are on and and most importantly all posts on and
space,not_removed,i feel like there needs to be a place on earth that looks exactly like this
space,not_removed,it never ceases to blow my mind to how normal this has become where i can be sitting on the toilet looking at my phone and be like oh whats this the grand canyon no its a perfectly clear color picture taken with a manmade rover crusing the surface of another planet million miles away fuck
space,not_removed,i want to know how high the cliffs are in the middle left background and what made the odd formations in the upper right corner of the photograph it looks like terraces interspersed with domelike piles maybe it happens all over on mars but to this earthling it doesnt look natural
space,not_removed,man seeing this is making me have an existential crisis there are trillions of planets like this in the universe how could we possibly be alone
space,not_removed,what i said to myself when i saw the photo thats fucking real like god damn that is dope
space,not_removed,sitting in my back yard in tempe and opening this image i quickly glance at it and think meh im just looking at maybe a beta test image whilst crawling around here in arizona but then i look again and say no it cant be arizona because there isnt any circle ks or ranch styled mid century subdivisions its mars this is a picture of my backyard but millions of miles away mars a whole other planet the words havent not yet been spoken to describe this image its too magic another planet not another arroyo
space,not_removed,i remember a miniseries on nbc like in the early called the martian chronicles i believe it was based off of bradburys novel but mars was supposed to be red haha how wrong we were editthis image is color corrected and i am wrong about the lack of redness and space modulators
space,not_removed,its a simple picture its justrocks and dirt but its on another planet something so simple is blowing my mind
space,not_removed,i was going to go on a rant about how the sky is the wrong colour then i remembered i am colourblind
space,not_removed,those numbers and lines are clearly proof of alien activity those dont occur naturally in that font
space,not_removed,first time ive actually comprehended it as an actual planet if that makes sense it looks like someone pulled off the freeway and snapped a pic amazing
space,not_removed,if you hadnt told me i would have guessed this was in the southwestern desert
space,not_removed,does anyone else look at pics of mars in hopes of finding remains of some ancient civilization
space,not_removed,kind of looks like the
space,not_removed,people are gonna be so bored once they get there remind nasa to pack a few dirt bikes
space,not_removed,mountain biking on mars epic mountain biking on earth kinda dorky
space,not_removed,one day there will be humans there and we will make big and beautiful cities and laugh at all the plebs left on earth
space,not_removed,fine go that way youll be malfunctioning within a day you nearsighted scrappile
space,not_removed,i see a day in the far future where disney is up to star wars xxi and are using this as a filming location for tatooine
space,not_removed,im sorry but that looks a lot like an ancient oceanlake bed holy shit
space,not_removed,i expect that fairly soon after we land on mars well have our first suicide because its soo compelling to just take your helmet off because it seems so much like earth
space,not_removed,careful remember sand people always ride singlefile to hide their numbers
space,not_removed,i found a white speck in the photo we should move mars rover to go find out what it is
space,not_removed,im reading red mars right now which a very realistic story of humanitys first attempts at setting up a colony on mars as well as exploring ways to terraform the planet into something more inhabitable a really interesting read right now as i think its something that we might actually start to see in our lifetimes there will be a whole lot of debate over whether its okay to just modify a planet to suit our needs and the example it sets for future human endeavors also the whole idea of whether earthly nationalities should be carried over to a new planet should the first colonies just consist of citizens of the countries that contributed the most to the technology needed to get to mars or should we make an effort to include people from all over the globe will the new nations of mars be directly under the control of their counterparts on earth or their own independent countries
space,not_removed,bruh this is fucking mars fucking mars its like looking at a scene from tatooine
space,not_removed,looks like the future will not run out of future star wars film locations
space,not_removed,question does the sky on mars actually look like that i was under the impression that it would be black because of marss thin atmosphere
space,not_removed,i cant even fathom this i remember like years ago in class learning about planets and seeing pics of them blurry blobs of color and now this im just gonna have to sit back and let this sink in for a few minutes this is fucking mars holy shit
space,not_removed,nasa seriously needs to employ an actual photographer its so frustrating cmon guys law of thirds show the sky how bout a sunset up your game before the batteries die im always waiting for something that looks like it could be an isaac asimov cover never happens although this is better than most
space,not_removed,incoming tinfoil hats pointing out man made structures and objects that look like people
space,not_removed,the sand people are easily startled but theyll be back and in greater numbers
space,not_removed,this could just as well be the background for mad max with a scale
space,not_removed,this image looks more like a photo some profession would take with a camera here on earth than what mars photos normally look like
space,not_removed,without vegetation its difficult to understand the scale of distance in this photo amazing seeing an image from mars so clear and high resolution keep it going humans
space,not_removed,im waiting for somebody to just take a picture of utah call it mars and reap the upvotes
space,not_removed,thats not mars its yakima wa and the moon landing was in a studio in burbank ca were not all idiots nasa
space,not_removed,were being lied to this is clearly nevada theres a nike shoe behind that rock there infowarscom s
space,not_removed,can you imagine its literally somebodys job to wake up and explore shit and take pictures with this rover i thought hiking was cool
space,not_removed,just think about it this is a mars another planet billions miles away a final fucking frontier
space,not_removed,lmao that is my backyard in az i shit you not i dont believe this is mars
space,not_removed,i guess if i put a scale in my utah pics i will be able to pass them off as mars
space,not_removed,lol this is in canada
space,not_removed,it would be something to have vr quality in mars that will blow my mind its probably very possible
space,not_removed,its just another world just like ours minus the air and plants only the next world over people will be living there soon just another world full of possibilities
space,not_removed,it looks like you could just set up a campsite and relax pretty weird
space,not_removed,some of the pictures theyve taken have been great mars is a lot less red than i used to think i could get with living there if need be
space,not_removed,wow this is amazing such a spectacular site i would love to have a similar tour of venus one day
space,not_removed,maybe its just because im colorblind but goddam that looks like a lake at the bottom of that photo
space,not_removed,how amazing is it to get a quality image such as this from another fucking planet
space,not_removed,wow that is so cool just so crazy to think how far away this shot was taken
space,not_removed,every time i see one of these photos i feel disoriented about the size of everything i feel like that could be a mountain or an ant hill back there even with the legend at the bottom is that the distance at the rover or at the top of that mountain
space,not_removed,when we go there in some years i hope they take a drone for some dank footage
space,not_removed,does anyone know if the color has been altered in any way would you see the exact same thing if you were standing there because that looks like parts of earth
space,not_removed,great so mars is like a trip through the painted desert to the grand canyon i can almost hear my kids fighting in the back seat do not make me stop this rover because i will i will and you will walk home
space,not_removed,holy shit thats an alien planet doesnt look too alien actually
space,not_removed,not sure what i was expecting the sky to look like but it looks like a normal cloudy day here on earth its a gorgeous picture
space,not_removed,this is like the before part in a beforeafter shot when mars gets terraformed
space,not_removed,how is the sky so bright i thought mars had a very thin atmosphere
space,not_removed,every time i see one of these im just amazed for a few minutes that this is another planet we are going to go here soon
space,not_removed,in all seriousness from the oblique angle of the photograph should the scale really be there everything in that photo has a skewed distance from that angle especially the far away mountains and hills
space,not_removed,its strange to see pictures from the mars rover after the iac suddenly mars is now humans could be looking at this place real soon itll have a name and history
space,not_removed,i can look at these pics for hours probably because im baked its just so awesome looking at pics of another planet
space,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters last usageinternational astronautical congress annual meeting of iaf members iafhttpwwwiafastroorg last usagejet propulsion lab california last usagemars exploration rover spiritopportunity last usagemars science laboratory curiosity last usageultrahigh frequency radio i first saw this thread at sep utc this is thread ive ever seen around here ive seen acronyms in this thread has acronyms httpdecronymxyz httpsredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
space,not_removed,the sand people are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers
space,not_removed,these pictures always blow my mind a little bit looks like it could just be some random place in arizona
space,not_removed,honestly with most pictures from mars i cant help but think yup thats a desert haha like the moon looks so alien mars landscape just looks like desert like any here on earth
space,not_removed,part of me wants to get rid of the scale bar and submit it on rearthporn to see what happens
space,not_removed,yea we can definitely put another las vegas there
space,not_removed,is my phone background and for some reason people keep thinking its utah
space,not_removed,watch out for the sand people
space,not_removed,there is an area on the utah arizona border just north if lake powell that looks like this edit i should also note that the area is full of dinosaur tracks
space,not_removed,exactly my thoughts shit doesnt grow there hardly and we have an atmosphere
space,not_removed,i know no wonder people dont want to spend billions of dollars to send shit to mars its like an even more dead arizona
space,not_removed,itd be a wonderful picture if it was arizona given that the location is million miles away its really wonderful
space,not_removed,mars like antarctica or the deep sahara but less hospitable
space,not_removed,girlfriend just said the same thing
space,not_removed,my god this shot is out of this world
space,not_removed,now thats a name i have not heard in a long time
space,not_removed,the rover should be careful and be wise to refrain from sightseeing and stick to its job
space,not_removed,exactly my thoughts upon seeing this
space,not_removed,is this a reference to something
space,not_removed,until a few years i always heard this line as a gentleman wastes enough to be troubled lightly i thought it was some wise quip from old obiwan
space,not_removed,the rovers travel in single file to conceal their numbers
space,not_removed,its another planet can be many in the universe just like this pic cant fathom it still
space,not_removed,what blows my mind is just how desolate it is the entire fucking planet is just empty nothing stunning landscapes and such im sure but completely desolate of inhabitants then you think about the fact theres basically an infinite amount of planets out there and a vast majority of those could very well be the same case it seems like such a waste
space,not_removed,its really crazy to think about how normal this stuff becomes as time goes on years so mars evoked thoughts of aliens scifi and this unfathomable distant cosmic place full of mysteries now looking at this picture it just seems soreal and even normal its just so weird to think this is an actual alien world a different planet and i can now very easily picture humans being there people may live there in the not so distant future weve spent our whole existence as a species acting as if earth was everything our whole world but soon we might have another world its scifi made reality
space,not_removed,this absolutely blows my mind i mean this is literally mars its amazing to think how far weve come or gone taken from a rover built in year steve jobs died the size of landed by a with photographed from space and has one of i consider it on par
space,not_removed,elon build the goddamn ict already what the shit weve got dunes to explore
space,not_removed,the fact i have an actual real detailed photograph of mars like this as my desktop background amazes me greatly
space,not_removed,yes figurative mars is a lot less impressive
space,not_removed,i feel the same way dude sometimes ill look at the moon at night and think fuck we shot a rocket with people inside to that rock waaay the hell out there to the fucking moon holy shit its so far away then ill look at the glowing red dot in the sky and be in awe to think that we are going to attempt to send people to that rock too that little red dot in the sky we call mars cant even comprehend that distance holy balls man how are people not more interested in this stuff
space,not_removed,to add to that sending an image of this quality on high gain antenna that far is super hard the modems only do very low communication speeds casinni does like im doing my senior engineering project and it really makes you appreciate how much goes into curiosity
space,not_removed,there are plants in the sky
space,not_removed,it almost seems like a race against time will humans find a way to explore these incredible places before we destroy ourselves with stupidity its an incredible time were living in frustrating too though
space,not_removed,if there isnt boobs or aliens the masses wont care
space,not_removed,love the optimism bro science is underappreciated nowadays
space,not_removed,the work put into the mars rover has nothing to do with the god delusion you neednt muddle your appreciation of nasas work with the ceaselessly reiterated prophetic mythi of stone age farmers
space,not_removed,we certainly have come a long way from the a little over years ago by the image resolution back then was much lower but computer processing power was also lower while waiting for the image to process the team and they were that excited to get an image from another planet you can literally see the hard work put in by people over the span of the past years to get us to this point we stand on the shoulders of giants
space,not_removed,you think the rover has a gopro or an
space,not_removed,quality looks like a lower res stretched out to me
space,not_removed,umm you say all that and then you say god bless dont wanna start something here but are you just using a saying or are you basically a contradicting being
space,not_removed,you just had to include god didnt you smh edit spelling
space,not_removed,the scene is presented with a color adjustment that approximates white balancing to resemble how the rocks and sand would appear under daytime lighting conditions on earth figure a includes a scale bar of meters feet
space,not_removed,actually this shot is the one with whacked out colors theyve deliberately adjusted it to look earthlike the shots you see of mars with reddishbrown skies is the more accurate color
space,not_removed,we have several on mars actually
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,the russians put a robot on venus years ago not sure why everyone seems to be under the impression that the mars rover is the first robot to land on another planet
space,not_removed,taking a shit thats a capitals shit im talking about here people
space,not_removed,a vast ocean of printer ink
space,not_removed,fuel or things that can easily be turned into fuel if there was a ton of fuel on the moon wed have an easier time with all our space travels since having fuel on a body with less gravity than earth can be worth thousands or tens of thousands of times more than it is worth on earth
space,not_removed,an livability it would mean an escape and allow the continuation of our species in case something happens to earth
space,not_removed,the most valuable thing is the knowledge and engineering advances that come from developing the capability to visit other planets think of all the cool technology that came out of the space program during the apollo era and how they have advanced to things we rely on every day now
space,not_removed,there isnt really anything valuable on mars that we dont have on earth already however knowledge is valuable having a self sustaining colony on mars is super important in case earth faces another extinction level event such as a massive asteroid super volcano eruption etc we want to have a safe place for humans to continue living once we have a colony on mars there will be more reason and desire to travel back and forth this should spur advancements in space flight to allow us to more easily explore and colonize other areas in the solar system maybe even outside our solar system
space,not_removed,if they had photoshopped a jeep climbing up a hill in the background for reference that would have been way better
space,not_removed,its the size of the feature directly under it that it covers
space,not_removed,id prefer a series of scale markers disappearing into the distance calculated from the rovers cameras focal parameters
space,not_removed,i put a silhouette of a tall man had to make him to keep some semblance of a human shape on the left side of the measured feature at the bottom
space,not_removed,i remember seeing a comment on another thread from someone who does this so there is a person lurking around that could likely answer some questions
space,not_removed,years from now somebody will remake the original star wars and this will be the set for tatooine
space,not_removed,sand people always ride single file to hide their numbers
space,not_removed,mars sucks earth is awesome
space,not_removed,earth is the only planet around that can support life for a reason
space,not_removed,mars numba earth numba
space,not_removed,it certainly looks similar it could be
space,not_removed,from the article posted above the scene is presented with a color adjustment that approximates white balancing to resemble how the rocks and sand would appear under daytime lighting conditions on earth
space,not_removed,im not so sure id call mars dead or anything i get what you mean it cant support complex life like what we have on earth although that might be up for debate since there is clear evidence of ice at its poles not expecting any grey men strolling about but maybe some extremophilic microorganisms but the planet itself was never alive at all its like how people talk about climate change killing earth earth wont give a fuck what we do to it were killing ourselves and most other organisms by steadily reducing earths ability to support the ecosystems that were a part of that being said what if we learn to somehow terraform a planet to become habitable could we one day turn this barren landscape into a paradise of our making mars wont care per say but we certainly will now most planets arent living creatures but then theres the brethren moons
space,not_removed,and its weird too that venus is dead but in a totally opposite and violent way
space,not_removed,and we shall bring it back to life
space,not_removed,i think thats the fallacy mars didnt die mars is just fine its any complex life that may have existed that died its the same with saving the planet you know what the earth will be just fine and dandy orbiting the sun whether the average global temperature rise or drop c its people that live on this planet thats gonna be fucked nevermind saving the planet its human that needs saving from ourselves
space,not_removed,its pretty incredible and thanks for the offer but pass
space,not_removed,i still cant wrap my head around the idea that this picture is from another planet its mind boggling
space,not_removed,i hope elon builds a cantina
space,not_removed,you can live there have to stay in your tin can below and no air
space,not_removed,thank you so much came looking for this
space,not_removed,the low gravity would be heaps on fun on a mountain bike until you wipeout and puncture your suit
space,not_removed,looks a lot like the hills around fort washakie wy so i would hazard a guess yes there was some moisture erosion in the past
space,not_removed,i am in no way qualified to answer this as a geologist but im fairly certain the smoother features are explained by wind specifically sand being blown around it literally get sanded down that doesnt mean that water couldnt have played a role at some time in history and somebody educated on this could probably tell you what evidence that would leave on the surface
space,not_removed,it happensmaybe if you put this picture in your facebook page and then received a lot of like for it she will be interested at last
space,not_removed,pftwhy does everone want to go back to jakku
space,not_removed,this image has been color corrected based on what it would look like on earth it wouldnt really look like this if you were standing on mars looking at it with your own eyes
space,not_removed,i cant quite give a good answer for whether or not countries should be implemented on a whole new planet however i do feel that ifwhen we colonize mars that it will be a much needed restart for humanity and how people see and treat each other this will be an immense undertaking and will require experts and people from all around the world to make happen a true united effort wouldnt it be ironic that life on mars could potentially become more pleasant than life on our home planet
space,not_removed,certainly doesnt look the same that picture is mainly smoother dirt mounds with grey mountains in the background the mars photo is rocky and noticeably redder the iconic rustiness from iron content ive been looking at fresh mars photos for about years now nope they arent fake that ship sailed long ago
space,not_removed,its white balanced to show what the colours would look like on earth
space,not_removed,go for it edit i didnt edit this its the source from nasa no idea why is tilted either its irks me as well sheck out this link for more info on the part that looks like water and other info about the photo
space,not_removed,marsporn is that a thing lets make that a thing
space,not_removed,maybe somebody took this out of rearthporn put the scale on it and are claiming its mars hell i bet there are some photos of craters of the moon natl park that could pass for some other planet
space,not_removed,im from las vegas and this pic made me homesick
space,not_removed,slightly related is gambling legal on other planets can i open a casino on the moon or mars i mean the draw for these places as tourist destinations will be pretty high for the first decade or two on their own but after that were going to need something to keep the tourists coming i might as well get started now so i can advertise with the slogan first casino on mars
space,not_removed,considering its a whole lotta nothing i can understand why people would think its utah
space,not_removed,what are you talking about thats totally utah
space,not_removed,you made a landscapeoriented picture your phone background
space,not_removed,looks like afghanistan to me
space,not_removed,our taxes at work look at the state of the roads in utah
space,not_removed,oh i just drove through there i know exactly where this is
space,not_removed,look at me this is my background now
space,not_removed,thats mars blows my mind
space,not_removed,i flew over utah in june and thought it was mars httpsflickrphsuffs
space,not_removed,theyll soon be back and in greater numbers
space,not_removed,tuba city gap page that area mostly was just there this past weekend and it looked eerily similar
space,not_removed,mars has an atmosphere its just not the same as ours
space,not_removed,yes but its also capable of supporting intelligent life while arizona is not
space,not_removed,now theres a name i havent heard since i cut off your fathers legs and threw him into a volcano
space,not_removed,we are all martians on this blessed day
space,not_removed,this isnt the reference youre looking for
space,not_removed,star wars this picture looks a lot like the fictional planet tatooine
space,not_removed,it pisses me off that the people of earth fight each other and quarrel instead of working together to continue exploring the universe we inhabit if i could hop on a rocket tomorrow and never look back id be gone for good
space,not_removed,yeah but you will notice the pattern after a few planets and you wont be able to meet other people even if you both are on the exact same spot
space,not_removed,each procedurally generated
space,not_removed,if we lug enough hardware there we can jumpstart terraforming and evolution maybe even take some intelligent shortcuts and have a thriving macrobiodiversity in a few decades
space,not_removed,no mans sky was more accurate than we think
space,not_removed,what blows my mind is that if i were there taking that picture i would suffocate it looks so earth like that i take oxygen for granted
space,not_removed,just the concept of existence is astonishing that planet was there way before we were alive and will continue way past our death the vastness of the unknown reminds me of the saying if a tree falls snd no one is there to hear it does it make a sound how many cosmic events happen with no one to observe them
space,not_removed,im confident in a few ten thousand years weve invented something that allows us to skip across interstellar space like its childs play and well be breathing life into countless dead rocky planets ironically maybe we become entities that are seen across the universe as gods maybe thats why the universe seems so empty because we havent started yet every other living creature would have an origin that is traceable to us but we would have none we would be seen as the the ones who came into existence from nothing the impossible creatures the creators
space,not_removed,the insanity of making that skycrane device land on what is just a spec in our sky working perfectly with no way to ever fully test it on earth absolutely amazes me
space,not_removed,walk without rhythm and it wont attract the worm
space,not_removed,hell i already started saving for my ticket and everything
space,not_removed,how are people not more interested in this stuff facebook text messaging tender grinder reddit trump hillary kardashian championships futball war terror attacks poverty masturbaition porn and a few more
space,not_removed,we put people on the moon and then brought them back
space,not_removed,a note we dont send any data back to earth on our hga like you point out the data rates would be too low for any useful science return the bulk of our data is sent through a uhf radio to any one of the existing mars orbiters typically mars odyssey or mars reconnaissance orbiter but sometimes maven or mex we can get mbits to those orbiters and they can match or exceed that when they relay back to the deep space network on earth via their hgas which are huge on an average day we probably downlink anywhere from to mbit of data back to earth in the scheme of things we consider this a lot
space,not_removed,of course i think the most famous one right now is the venus fly trap
space,not_removed,on the iss yes theyve got plants
space,not_removed,what happens first dumb people destroying the earth or smart people figuring out how to get off the earth find out next time on the human race
space,not_removed,totally agree with you were so close to expanding into our galaxy and at the same geopolitics and reality television us election and all the destructive religious wars are just as close to destroying us as a race or at least restricting our real potential
space,not_removed,it seems like elon musk is the only one running
space,not_removed,i subscribe to the notion that if humanity can survive the next years our civilization will survive for the next billion years
space,not_removed,to summarize elon musks presentation about going to mars go big or stay home and inevitably die
space,not_removed,the answer though is probably yes we will weve got less existential threats than we did years ago unless ai destroys us before we can spread well probably be ok
space,not_removed,so why cant they just show it how it really looks
space,not_removed,yeah but what does that mean
space,not_removed,we actually have several people on mars when did that happen

space,not_removed,mars atmosphere surface pressure – kpa atm composition by volume carbon dioxide argon nitrogen oxygen carbon monoxide earth atmosphere surface pressure kpa at msl composition by volume nitrogen dry air oxygen argon carbon dioxide water vapor climatevariable source wikipedia as you can see the surface pressure on earth is times greater than on mars also the chemical composition of what little atmosphere that is there is completely different comparatively little nitrogen but a tonne of carbon dioxide in short i dont know many plants that could live in that environment mainly due to the surface pressure however if you could pressurise the atmosphere somehow then i think it is likely that you could find a plant that would grow there is also this good discussion here with a few incorrect points
space,not_removed,would need to be something that can tolerate nearzero atmospheric pressure which rules out pretty much any macroscopic plants as far as im aware the daynight temperature swings are pretty brutal too you might be able to find a microorganism that could handle it but it would be tricky plus earth life generally wants liquid water which exists but is not reliably available on mars and what little liquid water you can find generally has nasty stuff in it up to and including httpsenwikipediaorgwikiperchlorateonmars aka rocket fuel oxidizer
space,not_removed,im not trying to downplay any other achievements im just having one of those moments where the fact that we are exploring on an interplanetary level and having a much more immersive experience now almost immediate access to the raw information on our phones and computers is mindblowing
space,not_removed,does the toilet flush otherwise itll be a shit storm
space,not_removed,the lords shit aholy shit if you will
space,not_removed,you mean a galaxy note lets hope not you can lose your balls that way on the toilet
space,not_removed,sohttpswwwquoracomhowmuchwouldlandingandreturningonekilogramofpayloadonfromthesurfaceofmarscost estimated the price of sending a payload is about and the price of returning a payload is nearly httpwwwapmexcomspotpricesplatinumprice so yeah i think fuel is a pretty reasonable bet to cut down those outward kgs although the first specimen demonstrating the existence of extraterrestrial life would be tiny and virtually priceless
space,not_removed,you didnt see that jeep in the background
space,not_removed,or a vertical bar indicating distance up to the farthest visible point
space,not_removed,i dont think its quite that simple an article mentions they adjust the colouringwhite balance and the brightness of the raw photos i believe there is some science involved in how the photos are processed
space,not_removed,i can help a little bit different teams process images depending on where theyll end up going at the end of the day at jpl the opgs team operations product generation system not a very descriptive acronym processes images on a daily basis into terrain maps a mesh mosaics for helping to target using the chemcam and more depending on whats going on mosaics like this one however which are great to stare at but not so informative for our tactical planning are created over a period of days or weeks often by a team at malin space science systems malin provided three of the cameras on curiosity mahli mardi and mastcam and they continue to provide operational support and image processing services for the mission im not an expert in their process but i can tell you that it relies on rover orientation and pose information encoded as metadata in each image that is taken we can essentially reconstruct the geometry of any given image and use that information to accurately stitch multiple images together
space,not_removed,imagine a remake of the martian on mars
space,not_removed,i dont like sand its coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere
space,not_removed,i read this in the voice of walter mathou being impersonated by kevin spacey
space,not_removed,in years i will be eligible to run for president mars sucks earth is awesome uenwinor
space,not_removed,as our sun expands and prepares to supernova do we know how many years that planets like mars would eventually orbit the sun in a more earth like zone of the solar system was just curious as to whether it would be as short as decades or as long as millennia
space,not_removed,that being said what if we learn to somehow terraform a planet to become habitable could we one day turn this barren landscape into a paradise of our making if we actually develope the skills to terraform another planet surely we would be able to just keep earth habitable
space,not_removed,and wouldnt it be terribly sad dont you see the parallel looking at mars or maybe venus can be a little like witnessing your own funeral
space,not_removed,do they make braille for computers
space,not_removed,well i hope some day they terraform mars so we can get fucked up in martian bars
space,not_removed,mars is gonna be awesome for like ten minutes then mars sucks forever
space,not_removed,yeah i think the first colonization of another planet will be huge suddenly our world is a lot bigger and will only be growing hopefully our differences will seem more petty in comparison and we can move past them it would be so fascinating to live years in the future when i would think mars is becoming a habitable planet supposedly we just have to melt mars ice caps and bioengineer some extremely resilient algae and the atmosphere will slowly become habitable or make windpowered factories that produce heat and oxygen mars has a lot of wind even in its very thin atmosphere but yeah i just hope that i can see the start of it within my lifetime at the very least to see the first man on mars i think itll be a wake up call for the entire human population to stop worrying about their little problems and focus on the future of the entire species not even the species but all life as we know it im pretty sure earthly life is destined to expand beyond earth and mars is the first step
space,not_removed,took me a hour hike in degree weather but was worth the shot
space,not_removed,cant really do it while its on the front page
space,not_removed,its not tilted i would guess the camera was at an angle and they straightened the photo to make the horizon flat
space,not_removed,if i had to guess id say that the rover was parked on an incline while taking this picture and nasa stabilized it by rotating it to look how it would with a level horizon it mayi seem a little unnecessary in this pic but it seems like they do that with just about every picture from the surface of a foreign body since those rarely align with the sorts of views were used to but thats just a guess im not an expert
space,not_removed,my mind must be fucking with me is that water at the bottom
space,not_removed,did you create a whole martian river just to remove the bar
space,not_removed,that black sand looks like water
space,not_removed,i processed the image in photoshop corrected temperature exposure and contrast
space,not_removed,thanks for taking out the scale but why is it squint now
space,not_removed,even looks like theres a little pond or lake at the bottom
space,not_removed,seriously i was just thinking this the other day yesterday i began amassing pictures of mars from the nasa image and video library
space,not_removed,ok but please call it something else this time i dont wanna use incognito every time i go there
space,not_removed,ann clayborn is that you
space,not_removed,and then uploaded it to the imagehoster called marsnasagov
space,not_removed,i dunno craters of the moon is a volcanic landscape and there are only four bodies in the solar system with volcanic activity earth io enceladus and triton and it would be hard to confuse those last three with earth i doubt theres any other place in the solar system that looks like craters of the moon even though some of the landscape of earth may not look earthlike they are pretty unique and worth preserving
space,not_removed,i live in las vegas right now an this photo gave me dejavu
space,not_removed,yeah utah is a barren wasteland for sure you wouldnt like it
space,not_removed,on my phone you can set a landscape photo as the background and when you scroll left or right you see more of the picture
space,not_removed,android launchers can have wide backgrounds and itll apply a parallax to it when you switch home screens
space,not_removed,well not the whole thing i just dragged around a
space,not_removed,i have a landscape oriented background on my phone as well when i scroll left and right from my main page the photo scrolls with it its a gorgeous shot of a lake at night with many visible stars in the sky and when i get to my last page a little sailboat is visible in the corner i think all android phones allow this
space,not_removed,theyll have much richer harmony
space,not_removed,well yeah but we humans enjoy doing things the hard way
space,not_removed,yeah but theyd have to resurrect stanley kubrick to do it
space,not_removed,i mean they already lied to us about the moon landing
space,not_removed,he did throw himgeeze embellish much
space,not_removed,or else the jundlands will merge with zendikar
space,not_removed,this isnt the answer youre looking for
space,not_removed,coincidence or is this the galaxy far far away that the movies are based off of they are non fiction right
space,not_removed,everybody just want that domination victory
space,not_removed,there is a tiny number of people in this world that can put effort into something like that and not have it be a total waste of time
space,not_removed,then you get to mars with the other colonists and start fighting and quarrelling with other people because thats what people do and its how we got this far anyways
space,not_removed,so maybe do something about it instead of just complaining on reddit
space,not_removed,fuck what if we are living in a broken simulation theory and we never ever find intelligent life because the dev lied and said it was mp when it really isnt
space,not_removed,i think mars cannot be terraformed because it has a weak and dying magnetic field solar winds just shred away the atmosphere because the planet is unprotected
space,not_removed,walk without rhythm ha you never learn
space,not_removed,if it really only costs all i need to do is find a friend willing to go with me
space,not_removed,tender yeah i know man these chicken tenders are soo delicious theyre keeping me from watching mars pictures no but seriously youre right its sad how stupid things like these seem more important than pictures from another planet those pictures are literally out of this world and most people wouldnt even look at them so crazy
space,not_removed,wow thats really good i didnt know that the data transfer from the mars relay was so high thats awesome
space,not_removed,thats the one doing all that damage to the ozone layer by luring it isnt it trying to open a portal for the goddess of love or someshit
space,not_removed,nah its ur anus er somethin like that
space,not_removed,theres little dipster the big dipster omicron persei and also shoe
space,not_removed,actually we are not close to expanding into our galaxy not even a long shot at this point we are getting really close to colonizing multiple planetary bodies in a single solar system which is no small feat overcoming gravity radiation extremely hostile environments but the next stage is trying to cross the vastness of interstellar space some of the most unforgiving and empty space that we can imagine we will have to be able to combat interstellar wind solar wind but higher energies and not just for a month trip for multicentury trip year trip if we are smart enough to figureout sustained fusion and incorporate it into some kind of reactionless thruster requiring only power to move or large tanks of fuel to be accelerated by heating up using a fusion reactor the vastness between just us and the next closest star is not only far but full of crap that we will have to expend significant human effort and ingenuity the likes of which we have not reached or seen in the modern era it will be on par with terraforming mars to be even remotely hospitable to life on the surface without domes
space,not_removed,the good news is that while yes we are still somewhat poised to self destruct violence is at a historically all time low
space,not_removed,ill let them worry about their politics and religion im gonna go explore and advance our species
space,not_removed,curiositys mastcams should be httpmslscicornerjplnasagovinstrumentsmastcam and they took the following pictures farewell to murray buttes from a year ago uses a different camera but mahli is about as truecolor as a consumergrade digital camera heres a because its neat heres another earthcoloredbalanced again because its neat the full resolution version is though so caution for anyone on a slow connection some of the latest pics from mars these should also be truecolor i think
space,not_removed,they do it this way so that the scientists looking at the photo can more easily identify the rocks since theyre used to seeing rocks under earth lighting conditions
space,not_removed,nasa has an obsession with tinkering with color photos and showing just about every color permutation imaginable except for the true color some of it is for scientific purposes as false color can be helpful some of it like this shot seems to just be done for shits and giggles
space,not_removed,iirc its a black and white camera with a bunch of filters they can choose from also remember that sunlight on mars looks different than sunlight on earth different atmosphere etc
space,not_removed,it means that the picture does not show what this place would look like if you were standing there seeing it with your eyes the picture shows what this place would look like if you picked it up brought it to earth dropped it down on the surface and then stood there and looked at it with your eyes
space,not_removed,they tweaked the colors to show how it would look if it was under earths sky
space,not_removed,ah the old reddit
space,not_removed,yeah but i dont really want caribou all over the place you know
space,not_removed,to clarify i m not disagreeing is the price assuming you bring your return fuel on the outgoing leg if you can make it on site then that drops a lot
space,not_removed,i put on my robe and wizard hat
space,not_removed,poor hayden good actor delivering really bad dialogue
space,not_removed,um mars is already in the habitable zone its thin atmosphere is doing a poor job at trapping heat hence its cooler climate
space,not_removed,as our sun expands and prepares to supernova just a technicality the sun will never go supernova it will expand to a red giant phase but wont follow the process of collapsing into a supernova it will instead eject its outer layers to form a nebula
space,not_removed,i think the sun will expand almost around the orbit of jupiter
space,not_removed,we may want to leave for other reasons such as overpopulation or discovery of a new resource rich life sustaining planet other than our own if human history holds any accurate predictions for our future its that at least a few people will venture out into the final frontier with no intention of ever returning whether its for economic reasons politicalsocial strife or just our innate curiosity i highly doubt that all of us would be content with staying on a single planet if we had the ability to leave
space,not_removed,i get you although i agree with mars being what mars was always supposed to be its sort of sad to think earth may one day look similar part of the cycle though aint it i guess what makes us different is that we have the potential and maybe the drive to get off the rails somewhat but regardless of what we do the universe will tick on doing what it does
space,not_removed,i have your mother here to read it for me
space,not_removed,i couldnt agree more it would indeed be fascinating to see further into the near future to see what has been accomplished by humans on mars i really do hold out hope that taking that step will make people realize that we are all one and we need each other regardless of race religion sexual orientation etc i see a huge two birds with one stone opportunity for mankind here one being that we may be able to continue on our existence relatively unscathed and the other being we set the differences aside to truly accomplish the most grand undertaking in our history as a species
space,not_removed,i think well see humans walking on mars within the next years did you watch elon musks presentation at iac a few days ago very inspiring
space,not_removed,hours into death valley but this beautiful view just about knocked me off my feet i was barely able to capture it with my best lens and camera doesnt do it justice but here you go httpsiimgurcomqrqfyrojpg
space,not_removed,taken on my old cheap broken camera i kinda hate earthporn sometimes
space,not_removed,just dont forget to put an enhance contrast filter on it
space,not_removed,took me weeks to fly there and in °c degree weather but was worth the shot
space,not_removed,because fuck human interaction
space,not_removed,you dont browse reddit often do ya
space,not_removed,this is the most plausible explanation the image was probably straightened to the horizon
space,not_removed,im guessing its iron sand which would explain the dark colour
space,not_removed,i dont believe there is water on mars
space,not_removed,if you zoom in there even appear to be waves
space,not_removed,i assume you mean slanted the photo op posted is a cropped version of this youll notice there is less included around the edges of ops photo while there is more sky and some rocks in the bottomright in the photo without the scale personally i think that the scale legend is kinda silly in the first place since scale changes with depth the farther you get away from the origin eg most of the photo the less you can really apply the scale
space,not_removed,now thats commitment to a joke
space,not_removed,that was the one thing i liked about my htc evo
space,not_removed,i know youre joking but please stahp too many people actually believe that shit e tooo
space,not_removed,it is stair wares hecouldhaveforcethrewhim
space,not_removed,you can go about your business
space,not_removed,yeah i saw those documentaries
space,not_removed,maybe so but often the person going for the science victory gets there first
space,not_removed,other side of that coin but yet without war and conflict today we could possibly be more advanced than we can imagine i like the idea that theres never a right way to do anything ever and i like the thought that the idea could extend to civilizations too hoping for star trek over here
space,not_removed,thats probably not true sure war inspires many technologies but honestly peacetime inspires just as much if not more in fact war has done more to impede human progress than anything we know of several civilizations that were set back hundreds or even thousands of years by war when the mongols attacked ancient baghdad they burned all of their texts and books and destroyed their irrigation system to make sure baghdad would never rise up again and indeed it wasnt until almost a millenia later in the century when iraq finally got back to where they used to be in terms of irrigation technologies what if rome hadnt fallen due to constant wars rebellions civil wars and a political system where offending the wrong official would get you killed what if the mongolian empire hadnt been picked apart by the grandsons of genghis khan what if the libraries of alexandria hadnt been burned downrepeatedly what if the byzantine ottoman and holy roman empires hadnt been at each others throats constantly we probably would be centuries ahead in terms of technology science and knowledge
space,not_removed,you mean like how civilizations greatly improved after people burns library of alexandria
space,not_removed,most tech advancements do happen after some huge population killer the black plague the holocaust etc were due for another
space,not_removed,not to mention everyone else is a npc
space,not_removed,what if its a sim where there wasnt supposed to be intelligent life at all and were just the margin of error
space,not_removed,what if we are npc of a abandoned game server
space,not_removed,well you didnt buy the god dlc
space,not_removed,pardon my curiosity but exactly what is the cause for the magnetic field dying is it due to a frozen core or something ok why is mars such a dead planet while say jupiter and saturn are even more distant more voluminous and lug around moons each and plutos moon is about its size what makes these planets so different
space,not_removed,take out a loan leave the planet never come back
space,not_removed,hey its me ur friend lets do it buddy
space,not_removed,that example stood out to be too i have no clue what theyre referencing or even if it was actually what they meant to say the only thing i can think of is the rthedonald meme chicken tendies lately thats just as topical as some of the other references they mentioned but not really part of american zeitgeist nearly as much as the other examples so im left confused
space,not_removed,no the concept of the venus fly trap was created by and for the chinese in order to make the us manufacturing noncompetitive
space,not_removed,with these colors i feel a lot less like going there
space,not_removed,but mahli is about as truecolor as a consumergrade digital camera even consumergrade digital cameras have trouble with white balance thats one of the basics of photography trying to get the white balance right if you take a picture under fluorescent light and your camera is set for incandescent everything looks like its tinted blue and colorless
space,not_removed,honestly half the excitement of the original post is gone now that i know its not true color can we have rspace make a policy of marking mars landscape posts false color so a lot of people like me dont waste time on such posts but also to incentivize posting of true color photography false color astronomical imagery is unavoidable but mars is more than just an astronomical subject now in light of recent events mainly musks announcement but also curiositys work etc i think its about time we take mars photography seriously
space,not_removed,the self portrait how was that picture taken i was expecting to see a mechanical arm extended out like taking a selfie but no its like something else took the picture
space,not_removed,quit bullshitting nasa just likes to use instagram filters on their pics just like everyone else
space,not_removed,according to this article httpmarsnasagovmslmissioninstrumentscamerasmastcam its a color camera and apparently it can shoot videos at fps also
space,not_removed,so for all we know mars doesnt look like this at all does its atmosphere or other environment elements change how our eyes would see colors
space,not_removed,i heard he died though
space,not_removed,also darrow and other helldivers
space,not_removed,im pretty sure john carter was there way before matt damon
space,not_removed,okay am i the only person curious as to how the fuck these things are assembled
space,not_removed,curiositys got the best of me im going in
space,not_removed,captains log just received a chef as part of the crew as i roam through the empty vacuum i am used to i think about how beautiful this universe truly is i wonder how this voyage will turn out

space,not_removed,hold my rover im going in
space,not_removed,hold my robot im going in
space,not_removed,hold my landing gear im going in
space,not_removed,if they could breathe the air theyd end up being weird bouncy deer so rutting season would be real interesting what with the males fighting this comment adds nothing to the discussion but giant bouncy deer thatd be interesting
space,not_removed,thats the point a kilogram of fuel made on mars is worth more than platinum
space,not_removed,but i was always told in sunday school that if earth was either feet closer to the sun or feet further away that we couldnt live on it are you saying i was lied to
space,not_removed,id be curious to see what jupiter would look like under a different gravitational interference since its almost completely gas except for a super dense core
space,not_removed,thats interesting she cant read
space,not_removed,ive been there before summit mountain beautiful place
space,not_removed,ha always with the wannabe photojournalism stories in that sub
space,not_removed,didnt ride as long as i usually do but i stopped for the scenery miles to go
space,not_removed,little bit of viginette up the saturation detail extractor little film grain httpiimgurcomylqldicjpg
space,not_removed,haha while i get your point i think he just means people will immediately recognize its not earth due to this post if you wait a week and its not fresh in peoples minds maybe they think its earth edit tough crowd yes i get it either hes saying you might as well just repost now because reddit is full of reposts or no matter when you post youll get shit on for reposting all of that is beside the point op wanted to post it under the cover of being the planet earth and thats obviously going to be harder to pull off when its currently on the front page because everyone will immediately recognize it
space,not_removed,well he will have to wait at least hours
space,not_removed,adobe lightroom even has a button to do this automatically it also then crops the edges so it looks like the original link
space,not_removed,extra extra reddit user discovers water on mars nasa baffled
space,not_removed,yes i do thanks i never considered it was originally slanted and op fixed it
space,not_removed,you can still use wallpapers like this if you have android
space,not_removed,but have you seen the flags yeah i know its right up there with the flat earth bs
space,not_removed,star wares get your star wares here
space,not_removed,you wanna buy some death sticks
space,not_removed,you mean that rebel propaganda
space,not_removed,i actually met luke skywalker he was less impressive in person
space,not_removed,i like the idea that theres never a right way to do anything ever yeah and the problem generally arises when your and my differences in opinion on how to do it right differ to such extremes that were willing to kill each other over it
space,not_removed,doubtful nothing like fearing for your life as an impetus to advance human progress we are a lazy species
space,not_removed,yeah this is really the issue i take with wars help things along assertion sure in some ways yes but theres no telling how much knowledge was needlessly lost due to instability borne out of war and the destruction it wrought libraries being burnt to the ground funds not being able to be used for the arts and sciences etc i find it hard to believe that events like the burning of baghdad and the fall of rome has no hand in preventing faster and better progress
space,not_removed,peacetime inspires just as much if not more only as preparation for the next war most of the advanced technology developed in the century is a direct result of military research funding earlier in the middle ages metallurgy developed mostly because of the need for more and better ironsteel for weapons if it werent for that blacksmiths would stick to making the same old hammers nails and horseshoes they have been making for centuries war has always been the main driving force for technology advancement
space,not_removed,looks like this guy was the first victim
space,not_removed,do you think people are complaining about what a letdown our entire universe is on some extrauniversal gaming forum
space,not_removed,hold on need to go rewatch the matrix architect scene
space,not_removed,very possible what if our astrophysical theories are skewed and were just seeing the last remnants of all the planets that were once inhabited
space,not_removed,ok why is mars such a dead planet while say jupiter and saturn are even more distant more voluminous and lug around moons each and plutos moon is about its size what makes these planets so different not entirely sure what you are really asking but mars is the way it is and not a lush planet like earth for main reasons one is lower gravity of earth and the other is no magnetic field lower gravity means that mars cannot retain much of its atmosphere mostly lighter elements and that its core has cooled enough to not have a molten layer that can sustain a magnetic field no magnetic field means that the solar wind can blow much of the remaining lighter elements away which brought mars to a only atmosphere ‎ n ‎ jupiter saturn uranus and neptune are all huge blobs of hydrogen and helium that was blown out of the inner solar system towards the outer reaches and trapped by the protoplanets they had enough mass from their formation and captured more and more gas as time went on pluto as you probably know is not considered a planet anymore due to many things but some of the most important are very elliptical orbit compared to the rest of the planets very inclined orbit relative to the ecliptic over ° while its ° ° for other planets existence of charon which is about half the size of pluto discovery of eris which is another transneptunian more massive than pluto and most important of all pluto has not cleared its own orbit which is an official condition for it being a planet all transneptunian objects including pluto and eris are mostly remnants of the material left from the creation of the solar system only the several most massive of them are spherical
space,not_removed,scientists believe mars is a completely cold planet because of its weak magnetosphere and also because there has been no geological activity observed on the planets surface in all the years weve been watching the reasons for mars having a cold core are up for debate but gravity is pretty much agreed to be a cause mars has like of earths gravity and also marss core might lack radioactive atoms like uranium which would keep it hot the gas giants like jupiter have a huge amount of gravity to keep things interesting earth is just the perfect size with the perfect amount of gravity to keep the core hot while also not making the surface uninhabitable
space,not_removed,im fairly sure he meant tinder as in the heterosexual version of grinder which he mentioned right behind it upvoted you for use of the word zeitgeist gotta love me some german words
space,not_removed,im fine with both and honestly i think the color corrected ones are closer to what we would see with our own eyes after theyve adjusted to the lighting on mars maybe somewhere in between as some other people have mentioned setting the white balance to capture the true color is something that camerasphotographers have trouble with even here on earth our eyes or brain automatically adjust for white balance in real life thats why things illuminated under an incandescent lamp still look white even though the color is actually skewed towards yellow and then you could change the illumination to a bright bluewhite led light and your brain would again autoadjust and white still looks white blue looks blue red looks red etc i think the most accurate pictures colorwise of mars are those that include the color calibration targets on the rover since if we were there our eyes would adjust so that red green and blue look like red green and blue regardless of the actual color temperature of the ambient light to a certain extent of course also i think the color targets are covered with dust now so they may not be that useful anymore
space,not_removed,its a composition of multiple pictures so the arm doesnt show
space,not_removed,its a composite of multiple pictures so they just kept the arm out of the frame for each picture you can see the shadow of said arm on the ground
space,not_removed,i believe stanley kubrick took it
space,not_removed,now id like to see a rover picture with the camera positioned slightly above the rover looking down and the rover making a duckface
space,not_removed,fps they should have just strapped a smart phone to it
space,not_removed,well i think what you mean is a version where the computer tries to make it like what you would see with human eyes there keep in mind that thats not necessarily more real depending on how you think about it im not sure about an exact raw or ifyouweretherecolor match to that exact image which is likely a composite but from someone elses link you can see its from november that was in the sol or potentially before if they were using an earlier image set you can httpmarsnasagovmslmultimediaraw edit says that it is a composite of shots taken on sep looks like that was sol and from that date
space,not_removed,well we can figure out what it would look like to a person standing there but that isnt necessarily the best way of presenting images and thats partly because of what you said the sunlighting scattering dust etc are different than what youre used to on earth especially outdoors analogy say you wanted to see the room im in right now and you ask for a picture im like how should the picture look and you say thats a stupid question show me what it would look like if i were standing there of course i send you a picture but you do not find it very useful thats because its very dark in here right now except for the glow of a computer screen your eyes would just see silhouettes of most things or bluishdistorted color falling on others youd then realize you should have asked show me the room with the lights on or with the shades open in the daytime even if i brick up the window and break the light fixture so it cant actually look like that youd still want a picture that shows the room as if it were lit normally so you can visually understand the objects in it in this case theyre showing you the landforms in an imagined lighting scheme that is earthly so that you can best process what the objects the rocks are like in natural terms that youre used to mars rovers actually use physical color calibration targets with several patches of known color on them in order to aid in the postprocessing calculations for photos httpmarsnasagovmermissionspacecraftinstrucalibrhtml and
space,not_removed,i believe its a reprocessed composite of some of

space,not_removed,nah brah thats what made it a comedy
space,not_removed,ive always wanted to start one i searched for switcharoo and it took me to rswitcharoo apparently a sub for all these roos so i was able to link one straight from there unless theres another way to do it im going to go with using the above voodoo recipe
space,not_removed,you can get an inkling from the upper left hand border of the photo you can see the edges of several of the cameras horizontal scans
space,not_removed,chefs log today im thinkin about some nice filet mignon to celebrate my arrival this switching cosmos filled with twisting and turning punchlines confusingly messed up jokes and an infinitely beautiful universe hmm this filets coming nicely
space,not_removed,sunday school packed with so much important information that one need only attend once a week
space,not_removed,not sure if you were implying this but the suns gravity wont get stronger when it becomes a red giant it would have to gain mass for that to happen
space,not_removed,asked my wife to marry me there
space,not_removed,haha yes this comments of people saying ive been there and nothing else of any interest
space,not_removed,thanks for doing this people need to insult that sub more
space,not_removed,detail extractor what is that magic photoshop tool
space,not_removed,you have far too much faith in the general reddit population
space,not_removed,the post could still make it to the front page as the redditors angrily sharpen their pitchforks and light their torches in the comments it happens somewhat regularly here
space,not_removed,so it seems you didnt get their point at all
space,not_removed,i think his point is that the frontpage often has dups so reposting now is not a problem and that we too should go sandleless
space,not_removed,but its nasa and im sure theyre more concerned about preserving as much data in their source rather than cropping away parts of the picture to make it look pretty no reason you cant do that you self if you want but for the purposes of science and archiving allpixelsmatter

space,not_removed,you dont want to sell me death sticks or finish watching this movie
space,not_removed,but at least you develop stuff to kill each other that eventually leads to space exploration so that later we can be awed by it and think about not killing each other
space,not_removed,we might just netflix n chill until the next mass extinction
space,not_removed,i regularly feel actual rage at the idea of all those ancient libraries getting destroyed over the centuries and i mean like true visceral anger that preoccupies me for a significant chunk of my day probably happens once every couple of months or so no telling where we would be right now had those institutions survived
space,not_removed,the big question in my mind is whether our simulation is realistic or not are we a replay of the future or an alternate reality with different variables are the laws of physics the same did we start with the same random seed can our universe be used to predict the future of our parent universe

space,not_removed,youre way overcomplicating things here on mars everything will have an orangeyreddish hue and be a bit darker due to the different atmosphere and distance from the sun the guy you replied to was asking for photos in natural colour as in photos not deliberately adjusted to look earthlike its really pretty clear
space,not_removed,thats all interesting to be sure but the layman in me is saying just take a picture of whats there and show it to me id rather see things on mars as they are instead of a doctored photo this picture is good but if its not true to reality what good is it an example i can go downtown and take a simple photo of a building i can then show this undoctored photo to someone whos never been there before and never seen the building firsthand and then take them to that spot they will already know what to expect because theyve seen it before i guess im just curious as to why nasa doesnt give us both the changed photo and the original actual image its an alien landscape with a different atmosphere different lighting but like people above have said this image looks like it could be in arizona i want to see mars not an earth lookalike
space,not_removed,we sent people with down syndrome to mars thats just mean

space,not_removed,apparently the actor who played little ani is in a mental health facitlity for schizophrenia
space,not_removed,and think about not killing each other in space or from space
space,not_removed,its like imagining einstein or hawking being killed by a reckless driver who was speeding through an intersection because he was in a fit of rage and wanted to go beat his wife right before they were about to change to the world and all of their notebooks were burned in the subsequent fire
space,not_removed,me too though i think the technology information losses are far outweighed by the cultural losses im sure records of entire civilizations communities were lost forever stories about the human aspect people who lived loved and died all evidence of their existence vanished forever artworks legends ideas accomplishments
space,not_removed,here is a short older on their attempts to get natural color and the inherent compromises and imprecision involved in that i guess im just curious as to why nasa doesnt give us both the changed photo and the original actual image this is a really weird statement to me httpmarsnasagovmultimedia including the for this particular photo pretty sure thats the right sol and camera if its not true to reality what good is it apart from there not being a particular reality the good of a photo like this one is that it lets you compare and contrast objects on mars to objects on earth without going there since youcant it helps you understand the rocks better say i was judging an open competition for the prettiest hair color youre my photographer and youre only to bring me pictures of what i would see in real life one finalist is actually an elf who lives in the arctic and only appears in high summer which is totally allowed under the rules but means you only ever get another finalist is actually an who got sunburned just taking that shot the third finalist is a werewoman only human under a full moon in the forest again thats within the rules and no judgement but youll only ever meet here under under your stipulations on natural my job would be impossible clearly what i need you to do is to take the raw data from each of your three photos and present to me your best calculation of what the subjects hair would look like under the same light even if theyll never be under the same light an example i can go downtown and take a simple photo of a building i can then show this undoctored photo to someone the key is to realize that there is no simple photo of a buiilding all photos are doctored when you take a picture with your cameraphone light is hitting a that are not at all exact duplicates of the rods and cones of your eyes theyre going to be sensitive to different wavelength ranges and responsive to different intensities they try to overlap pretty well with normal human vision in the aggregate and you can see from that picture that they may do things like double the number of green detectors for finer green data as humans are most sensitive in the green range but thats obviously a very rough kind of compromise for that problem always what with should i make the image assuming that you have the mean color perception for individuals in each given wavelength range the median that youre unusually perceptive or even latently tetrachromatic the real work is always done with exposure settings and postprocessing decisions where there is no true right answer how to weigh and combine fudge and extrapolate the different color channels data to get a natural outcome is always going to be about guessing and compromising around a very complex set of uncertain factors you want the picture i send you to look like what the scene would look like if you were there well how dilated would your pupils have been different for different people and conditions do you mean how it would look from one glance so i should use different color intensity and sharpness and focus radiating out from a central point to mimic your rod and cone placement should i clean up deviations in patterns at the periphery that your brain would likely have filled in maybe i can assume for the last two that you want to be able to look around the image with saccades the same way you would look around the scene but then if something is in shadow and a bit off to the side should the color and brightness of it look like what they would look like to you if you were looking at the middle of the photoexcept in focus or should it look like what it would look like if you moved your gaze to look at that spot and your eyes and brain adjustedthen should it assume youd have shaded your eyes with your hand at that point and try to mimic that or what if theres some httpbraindencomcolorillusionshtm property and all of this is not in solike if you had one eye closed with whatever other implications there are of that and that has avoided the elephant in the room how are you going to be looking at this photo so i know how to compose it to give you the same impression the building would in real life on an lcd screen what color temp settings should i assume and what should i assume about the brightness and color of the backlight the ambient light in the room and the angular size of the screen on paper of some kind what assumptions should i use about the lighting in the room youll be in the background surface youll put the photo on or how shiny the materials are

space,not_removed,for a split second there with i thought that five rockets were being launched simultaneously
space,not_removed,the one when the bird in the forefront is awesome thanks for sharing these
space,not_removed,yeah i can see how it might look that way the other tall structures are lightning arrestors intended to capture and divert stray lightning bolts away from the sensitive payload highly flammable fuel that make up a rocket on a launchpad
space,not_removed,thank you that was pretty much pure luck on my part i had one camera on a tripod shooting and i was handholding a canon with a lens i generally keep it zoomed out a little bit because i like to catch the reflection of the rocket engine on the water between the viewing area and the launchpad and the bird flew right through the shot as i was tracking the rocket upwards if id been zoomed in tight i wouldnt have had him at all it also wasnt my first brush with unexpected birds in a photo this year one of my remote cameras at the launch captured a flock of great white pelicans fleeing the delta iv heavy liftoff that photo actually in aviation weeks photo contest space division
space,not_removed,on the same page are aliens draining our solar energy i find it hard to take news like this seriously when they have links to alien stories
space,not_removed,this goes to the heart of a controversy of sorts that has been running for centuries is math descriptive or prescriptive in this particular instance does a mathematical model based on a big hologram proof that this is what the universe is or is it just one of many possible models that happen to fit
space,not_removed,where is the evidence why would this be considered as a legitimate claim in the first place at best this is a click bait title without supportingconclusive evidence
space,not_removed,they needed to remove the alien pyramids before posting the picture obviously
space,not_removed,thought its not exciting many ppl are already jumping on this elsewhere im sure that many of you have seen the news reports of a seti signal detected from the star hd i was one of the many people who received the the email with the subject candidate seti signal detected by russians from star hd by virtue of radio telescope since the email did come from known seti researchers i looked over the presentation i was unimpressed in one out of scans that passed over star showed a signal at about times the mean noise power with a profile somewhat like the beam profile of course setihome has seen millions of potential signals with similar characteristics but it takes more than that to make a good candidate multiple detections are a minimum criterionbecause the receivers used were making broad band measurements theres really nothing about this signal that would distinguish it from a natural radio transient stellar flare active galactic nucleus microlensing of a background source etc theres also nothing that could distinguish it from a satellite passing through the telescope field of view all in all its relatively uninteresting from a seti standpoint but of course its been announced to the media reporters wont have the background to know its not interesting because the media has it and since this business runs on media everyone will look at it ata is looking at it i assume breakthrough will look at it someone will look at it with arecibo and well be along for the ride and ill check the setihome database around that position and well all find nothing its not our first time at this rodeo so we know how it works
space,not_removed,my first concern would be biological compatibility would either they or us be subject to serious disease or death it could happen through something as simple as slight differences in the dna structure if they even have dna vs some other information carrying molecules it is possible that merely by entering their atmosphere it could be fatal to them of us
space,not_removed,a post detection protocol pdp exists and is somewhat thorough
space,not_removed,be afraid of dead alien bodies put face close to alien cobra thing release alien terror upon exploration party crewmates
space,not_removed,pretty sure there is a basic how to guide on first contact that got released awhileback im sure its been upgraded since
space,not_removed,do you mean discovery of any life at all or contact with sentient life
space,not_removed,there is a nasa and un planetary protection protocol made in it isnt about the breaking of news but requirements for rover sterilization and the directive that all exploration stops as soon as any life form is found or definitely detected according to a united nations treaty countries should conduct exploration of so as to avoid their harmful contamination thats why mars rovers including curiosity are carefully cleaned before being launched to avoid taking microbes from earth into outer space we are living in the age of announcements for announcements finding any kind of life not from earth would be the biggest announcement of announcements it probably depends on whether the discovery is of a microbe or a reptilian martian having gone totally underground for million years walking up to curiosity and taking a selfie with it
space,not_removed,microbialvery simple lifeforms yeah probably gonna be made public intelligent life forms we can communicate with most likely we wont hear about it
space,not_removed,on top of whats already been said remember the leaks over the higgs discovery at cern theres no way anything like this would be kept quiet due to social media and anonymity nowadays
space,not_removed,why do i think wed find out about alien life on twitter when someone is jumping up and down finding a signal rather than those protocols in the case of tabbys star for example its beyond protocol everyone and his brother that has productive hardware has observed or will be observing that star thats too many people to follow a protocol
space,not_removed,this is specifically about etis though i would imagine a different set of protocols should exist for the discovery of nonintelligent life in our solar system
space,not_removed,god everyone in that movie was an idiot
space,not_removed,thats not a guide thats a what not to do
space,not_removed,have a cat leap out of a storage locker
space,not_removed,is it being updated yearly with the resoults of latest scifi movie endings
space,not_removed,im curious as to why you think we wouldnt hear about it
space,not_removed,very unlikely think of an ape against us similar still cant communicate effectively we would likely be worms to intelligent life
space,not_removed,everyone knows about mitochondria
space,not_removed,protocol uhhhh houston there seems to be some type of life form up here uhhhh okay does it seem dangerous no its just this slug looking kind of thing okay uhh ill let everyone know good job
space,not_removed,true if you want to know what nasa would do and how it would treat a planet found to have life look too the httpsplanetaryprotectionnasagovoverview they have a lot to say about what nasa should and shouldnt do to protect terran life and alien life from cross contamination they have different protocols for nasa probes to follow depending on contamination risk for example an orbiter doesnt need as much sterilization as a rover
space,not_removed,well we can communicate with them apes can learn sign language and carry on conversations with people that said were not going to find intelligent life without lots of warning any species that has sufficiently learned to utilize the resources of their home system to reach the point where attempting to broach the interstellar void is cost effective will likely be seen approaching for a couple of years they would probably end up in one or all of the centauri systems before they bothered with us who wants to bother with competition for resources especially when you can lay claim to whole systems
space,not_removed,such a bad argument though i hear neil tyson and supposedly clever people talking like this too but eh just makes no sense at all to put it that way similar in dna maybe but that small percentage has unlocked such vast amounts about us that weve been able to build on it over time standing on the shoulders of giants to create modern civilisation and all of our advancements in science and art and everything else so we could be just different but from that we have gone from being more to more to more without our dna even changing significantly over that whole period to think that a few extra necessarily would unlock even more potential just doesnt stand up to reason even if a human was given or the brain power as the rest of us they wouldnt necessarily become disinterested in music and art and fiction and they would still have insane amounts to learn from the rest of humanity for the rest of their lives we are diverse of mind we specialise and we grow in so many ways any alien species more advanced than us genetically could easily be very very interested in us regardless of that gap also there could even be other factors that work universally to stop this gap growing beyond a certain point for example once human civilisation both science and society got to a point where we started to patch up genetic issues with medicine and social care and everything else its arguable that we have have stopped evolving in any particular advancing brain power for example direction now because weve reached a point in progress where its no longer selected for evolutionarily now we dont know for sure because we dont have anything to compare with but it could easily be that this situation is common amongst life when it gets to a certain point in civilisation maybe its not maybe it happens every single time who knows i find it pretty annoying when i see supposedly clever people thinking so closedmindedly on topics like that as if theyve already figured out the answer or something and then getting up on stage and telling everyone all about it without mentioning that theyre just guessing and could quite easily be wrong about the entire idea so stop it p
space,not_removed,i see your point but worms doesnt visit other planets
space,not_removed,the reasons we cant communicate with apes is because they can barely communicate with each other any two reasonably intelligent beings should be able to figure out some method of communication
space,not_removed,if we have it is certainly with a species which has vastly greater technology and maturity than we do technology to travel and notice our rather pathetic impact on the universe maturity because the odds against them reaching intelligence at exactly the same time as us are staggeringly unlikely
space,not_removed,exactly this is the most logical answer to this entire discussion btw we dont play an evolutionary role anymore unless some sort of pandemia decimated most of us but few which wont happen and even if that happen we got people in submarines lost around the world we got people on the iss we got people in deep bunkers dont worry the actual human is not going to evolve anymore but its technology will
space,not_removed,they dont need to they have all the spice they need right where they are
space,not_removed,visiting the moonother planets is like moving to another patch of grass weve barely left our own patch let alone explored enough to get noticed
space,not_removed,humans are still evolving though just slower as selection pressures decrease for example peanut allergies exist but now that peanut products are so common there is a pretty strong selection pressure against going into anaphylactic shock on contact with peanuts
space,not_removed,i appreciate your reference
space,not_removed,worms dont need to build ships to move to another patch of grass lets not downplay humanitys achievements just because the universe is more or less infinite ok
space,not_removed,uemhaze you both need to stop spreading misinformation it hurts the community as a whole where do you get this information from did you just think of that yourself you and your buddy mike smoked up and came up with the theory in his basement an onion article im keen to know with a sample size of it is impossible to know in our sample humans are the most advanced intelligent lifeform whos to say were not in the whole universe my claim is just as true as yours stop spreading your fact like its been proven or is even remotely close to the truth no other animal on earth has even come close to reaching another planet let alone artificial flight again my claim is just as true but actually backed with better evidence than both of yours im not saying youre wrong because no one even the greatest mindsgoverning bodies know the real answer its just fairly useless to spread unproven claims around
space,not_removed,no it doesnt help at all people arent dieing for peanut allergy or getting any problems respect the other humans to have more of survival survival is the only way to evolve since in order to evolve the people without the evolving condition have to have a significant disatvantage to survive in any mean without population reduction some people have changes but those arent going to change anything because the people without them will survive and reproduce anyway exceptions will hapen in some and others and then disapear and others will appear but that is not global evolution anymore since theres not any trait that will efect global population unless a disaster happen like some volcano disaster that releases a bad gas which affect the entire world and kills a lot of humans the survivors will all be better suited to the gas thats evolution
space,not_removed,understandable just simplifying the analogy obviously there is a vast difference between humans exploring the universe and worms moving grass patches
space,not_removed,where do i state this as a fact
space,not_removed,the if were only away from apes yet so different cognitively aliens would at least that different to us is regurgitated black science man
space,not_removed,if were not wrong why are you being so patronizing were not spreading misinformation were just debating with what little information about the infinite universe we have keep the discussion friendly
space,not_removed,do you have a bachelors degree are you planning on sticking it out in the air force until retirement you may have already looked into this but im a and you may be able to get the air force to pay for your bachelors in physics by doing a rotc type program and commissioning im currently earning my masters degree in physics at afit with an emphasis on space weather which is about as close to planetary physics it gets while still staying mission relevant so i just wanted to let you know there is a compromise available to you to get a full time physics bachelors and some research work under your belt while still keep your air force retirement the way i see it i can always go back for a phd on the civilian side once i make and the air force gave me a free masters degree and research experience along the way
space,not_removed,i also know a phillip who aspired to be the first man to walk on mars what a crazy coincidence
space,not_removed,i dont have one yet but im planning to do at least ive been waffling over which program to pursue and havent made any real progress id considered pursing the auabc program to get a degree w as little effort as possible but i wasnt really interest in any of the programs offered id considered pursuing rotc about years ago but air university told me id forfeit my current retirement plan so that served as a deterrent to pursuing that any further i suppose i could followup w mps to confirm this but if thats the case im not sure it would be an option
space,not_removed,well yesh in this universe anything is possible but few things can be proven a fact
space,not_removed,just to be sure the little dot lower left of the sparkle in the middle is earth
space,not_removed,my assumption is that the sparkle is the earth and the dot is the moon the earth is the brighter of the two
space,not_removed,upvote and comment because id like someone to explain what we thought wed see versus what the data is telling us
space,not_removed,i believe what we thought was that it had a solid core spinning very fast causing its intense radiation similar to the way earth makes its magnetic field only its like time stronger which is why we have so many questions if theres no core learning what generates the magnetosphere will teach us something new

space,not_removed,rosetta will not be bringing back samples it dropped its lander philae to the comet a few years ago and now rosetta will crash to the surface and transmit all the data and pics it can
space,not_removed,doesnt really explain why intelligence should be an evolutionary imperative intelligence is one possible evolutionary niche out of many that happens to enable an organism to survive robustly within many environmental circumstances
space,not_removed,doesnt really explain why intelligence should be an evolutionary imperative also it seems to imply that intelligence is unique to higher life forms but humans are just more intelligent than other species however i think an argument can be made that intelligence increases chance of survival which fits with the apparent truism that life wants to live
space,not_removed,doesnt really explain why intelligence should be an evolutionary imperative you could argue that intelligence is an evolutionary dead end they eventually nuke themselves to extinction i suppose it depends on how cynical we are p
space,not_removed,no examples of that happening in all the intelligent species of which we are aware
space,not_removed,maybe they ended themselves before we could become aware of them thats what i mean about the cynicism but of course its not a given they might have set up colonies on other planetsmoons before their home planet was obliterated in nuclear annihilation in that case theyd probably still be around and be more intelligent than before because they would know exactly whats at stake
space,not_removed,baseless speculation that goes against every known example isnt a very good argument unfortunately
space,not_removed,the same could be said about speculating on the existence of aliens there could be a vast galactic empire that we are unaware of or the creation of even single cellular life could be so improbable that its only happened once in our galaxy until evidence of life outside our planet is discovered everything is just speculation
space,not_removed,theres only one known example and his speculation is part of the filter theory
space,not_removed,those big parachutes always look so surreal and almost fake very interesting
space,not_removed,heres a full res shot from nasas bill ingalls
space,not_removed,these soyuz pics always make me dream of landing on another planet and being stranded there edit that could be an ocean or lake on terraformed mars
space,not_removed,so thats probably a great feeling going to space and coming home
space,not_removed,for those that dont know what expedition is
space,not_removed,ill be honest i thought this was a modded screenshot of ksp i feel dumb
space,not_removed,sorry the dumb question but is that something landing back on earth from the iss i checked the wiki but not very informative
space,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters last usageextravehicular activity last usagekerbal space program the rocketry simulator im a bot and i first saw this thread at oct utc ive seen acronyms in this thread has acronyms httpdecronymxyz httpsredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
space,not_removed,i thought missions overlap by months a group went up last week or so and this group is down already isnt there supposed to be a month period where the new missions crew can get used to the living conditions and stuff
space,not_removed,for anyone like me who thought the iss is unmanned now current crew commander shane kimbrough sergey ryzhikov andrey borisenko
space,not_removed,for this and other great photos check out nasas instagram account httpswwwinstagramcomnasa
space,not_removed,okam i the only one who is getting chills just by looking at the picture
space,not_removed,probably get a lot of free scratch if you throw a coca cola logo on the top of that parachute just saying
space,not_removed,what happens if the wind carries the capsule into syria or north korea
space,not_removed,awesome just watched the whole debark and reentry on video file to all the folks who want proof watch some video file outside of that become an astronaut and see for yourself or just stop quacking be productive not arbitrary
space,not_removed,how does they manage to take such photos given the time frame to capture this moment with correct camera settings in matters of seconds
space,not_removed,bot beep beep im all about top posts this post had upvotes and got posted to twitter and subreddit the tweet all upvotes are on and and most importantly all posts on and
space,not_removed,pull the chutes and grabs your cutie hayloadz and head on over to rshittyaskflying
space,not_removed,its a shot form a boards of canada video right beautiful picture
space,not_removed,hahaha open your eyes this is the silliest goofiest fakery nobody goes to outer space
space,not_removed,this is either shopped or i am not sure parachutes dont work that high up edit downvotes and nobody has proven this is real
space,not_removed,i thought this was a screenshot of kerbal space program for a moment
space,not_removed,well thats because the whole thing was faked anyway s
space,not_removed,i always think they look like giant tunnocks teacakes
space,not_removed,bill ingalls is always in the right place at the right time i mean its his job but it must be amazing to get to attend nearly every interesting spaceflight event
space,not_removed,that photo is absolutely gorgeous
space,not_removed,heres a direct link to the image
space,not_removed,why is this one so yellow
space,not_removed,thank you became my wallpaper the moment i saw it
space,not_removed,i didnt realise intially there are a bunch of pics here thanks
space,not_removed,is there a way to make this my computer background
space,not_removed,that has to be an incredible feeling going to space and back is amazing
space,not_removed,or maybe earth just is pretty rad
space,not_removed,they shoot earth for every planet so you should feel bright you just have to realize what your first reaction is telling you
space,not_removed,thats not water thats just how flat the central asian steppe is
space,not_removed,for those that dont want to click the link its the expedition to the international space station
space,not_removed,to boldly go where other people have gone times before and do science stuff and come back
space,not_removed,i mean have you seen the mods they have these days your assumption isnt that farfetched
space,not_removed,httpiimgurcomhmsomuypng my attempt actual good photo
space,not_removed,yes soyuz landed back on earth containing the members of the expedition after their days in space
space,not_removed,not dumb at all this is the expedition to the iss and they just landed back on earth today
space,not_removed,iss crew landing back on earth from iss
space,not_removed,follow nasa on snapchat they just covered the last landing in kazakhstan and it was really cool
space,not_removed,i thought the overlap was usually just a week or two when there is a space tourist or other relatively shortterm crew member they ride up with two of the new crew and leave with the first departure of two of the old crew
space,not_removed,why did you think it was unmanned
space,not_removed,then best korea will celebrate a successful mission
space,not_removed,by the time main parachutes open the capsule is already too low to get carried away that far however it is be possible to get far off the landing zone if there are problems with capsule separation like with
space,not_removed,its actually a little easier than you might imagine professional sport photographers do something similar it has to do with you camera settings shutter speed film speed exposure time for a pro with the right equipment this could also be a still from a video
space,not_removed,the only fakery here is pretending that you have anything intelligent to contribute to this discussion
space,not_removed,im going with you arent sure
space,not_removed,how high do you think it is seems to me like you can make out the fog covered terrain below and the craft is below cloud cover
space,not_removed,what theyre below the cloud layer how high do you think they are the soyuz fires a drogue parachute at about km and the main parachute follows quite a while later parachutes certainly work at that altitude haho jumps routinely toss their parachute at around km
space,not_removed,the whole launchdockingreentry sequence for the soyuz is explained in this vid but the part you are interested in begins at
space,not_removed,if you look closely enough you can see jeb riding on the outside to get his eva science raised
space,not_removed,if it were one of my kerbals the thing would be on fire and they would all be screaming as the parachutes rip off
space,not_removed,thats exactly what i was about to say
space,not_removed,i wish buzz aldrin would punch everyone who thinks that
space,not_removed,isnt he busy trying to save his friend woody
space,not_removed,cant tell if real or troll
space,not_removed,sorry but i think all of it is faked love to see proof one single trip to outer space is real
space,not_removed,im jealous the guys gets paid to go to events that i would pay to go to
space,not_removed,different photo note how you cant see the far side of the parachute in ops but you can in this one i think this one hasnt been colorcorrected
space,not_removed,truth i think we all forget how strikingly beautiful our planet is
space,not_removed,can confirm source earthling
space,not_removed,earth is pretty rad i mean its the most interesting planet that weve found space exploration is cool too but we really could do a lot more for our planet as well
space,not_removed,its weird because i imagine it as having stairs
space,not_removed,what i completely thought that this was water until i clicked through the res photos how amazing
space,not_removed,thanks that guy was actually trying to make me learn something
space,not_removed,can i just get a summary
space,not_removed,thank you for giving a straightforward answer rather than playing it high and mighty
space,not_removed,those are fantastic photos thanks for sharing
space,not_removed,didnt think it through a crew went up and they came home
space,not_removed,uuuuh soyuz is russian hardware and american hardware would never ever return to earth anywhere near north korea
space,not_removed,why the parachutes dont work when they are high up
space,not_removed,in an earlier comment i said well over feet and i am sticking by that
space,not_removed,hed better be careful the propulsive landing will leave goo on his face
space,not_removed,which planet is this
space,not_removed,you can do that while parachuting
space,not_removed,just another day at kerbal space center
space,not_removed,im sure he is busy punching flatearth theorists at the moment
space,not_removed,what about michael collins
space,not_removed,where can i buy tickets
space,not_removed,bonus points for yelling muda while punching
space,not_removed,he did
space,not_removed,were not aiming for the truck
space,not_removed,its important to remember that nasa hires all sorts of people not just engineersscientists lawyer who likes space theyve got a place for you there accountant yup emt yup artist you bet
space,not_removed,space x stock holders are listening
space,not_removed,the more exposed to a thing you are the more mundane it seems
space,not_removed,i tend to have an overall pessimistic attitude towards life but i cant help but sit there in awe and wonder whenever i think about the earth its so huge and beautiful and complex i wonder how aliens would react to this immense beauty if they came here
space,not_removed,as much as many of us would love to colonize another planet our children would long to go to earth more than we wanted to get away from it
space,not_removed,you forget everything about you has been conditioned for this planet swooning over earths beauty is like saying water is wet
space,not_removed,the russians are the only ones who ever had a space gun on board for their cosmonauts to shoot at bears hunt for food or shoot flares the luke skywalker could defend himself with a lightsaber on hoth a russian cosmonaut would have had a three barrled shotgun and a machete
space,not_removed,for those who prefer one word summaries space
space,not_removed,for those too lazy stupid and unmotivated to breathe reddit and videogames
space,not_removed,and theres another going up in midnovember
space,not_removed,its basically the opposite side of the planet from where the us typically lands its stuff
space,not_removed,should never say never especially in astronautics where so much can go wrong
space,not_removed,parachutes require air to create drag if you go too high there is too little air if you go high enough you are in space and there is no air parachutes dont work in space either
space,not_removed,by the looks of it either kerbin or laythe
space,not_removed,not the earth
space,not_removed,depending on how fast youre moving and the density of the atmosphere you dont even need parachutes its generally a good idea though because a kerbal on a ladder with significant wind will be knocked off the spacecraft how else are you going to get eva science for the upper atmosphere
space,not_removed,the irish freedom fighter i dont think he ever went to space he died in
space,not_removed,i think you mean phil collins
space,not_removed,id assume thats the reason he said it
space,not_removed,ah i kinda agree with you about the rockets i think they go far up but not continue into outer space i think they come back down and crash into ocean i even think sometimes they fake launches because faking in their thing and why not but i agree rocket launches generally speaking are a reality and satellites are super fake haha yes
space,not_removed,artist what im a musician could they use me haha
space,not_removed,nasa hires accountants for space missions i hope
space,not_removed,thats true for the slice of land you occupy but the more you travel overall the more you appreciate the beauty and wonder that is earth i would imagine
space,not_removed,mundane is that an etymological joke cause in this case it could be because everything about earth is mundane
space,not_removed,thats not true if you look around there is a whole industry based around tourist sites everyone know how cool stuff is
space,not_removed,im kinda the same like there are planets and moons in our solar system which are all rock all gas or completely covered in ice yet here we are a rocky watery planet with ice on each end and surrounded by gas earth is pretty cool i guess
space,not_removed,im confused are you knocking on my swooning i dont think there is anything wrong with enjoying the beauty of earth or the wetness of water
space,not_removed,for commercial enthusiasts we lift things up and put them down
space,not_removed,for those who dont want to read
space,not_removed,space debris hits the ship and diverts its course while damaging its thrusters voila
space,not_removed,fair the us would never design a mission to have astronauts land near north korea give nks current political state i think that is a safe thing to assume
space,not_removed,sounds like pretty good cover to me
space,not_removed,phil collins only thing about him is the way he walks
space,not_removed,since were rambling nonsense i guess the andromeda galaxy is just some xenon light that god put there for us to only be able to see with long exposures heres a its a shame really youre missing out on so much fascinating information about our universe
space,not_removed,the record on voyager ii has music on it right
space,not_removed,im sure they could i bet the education and outreach group would always need someone to make sound for their presentations and such
space,not_removed,you might have a hard time transitioning to the astronaut corps but youve got a decent chance of finding a satisfying career making space missions happen httpsnasajobsnasagovjobsoccupationshtm only of nasa employees are scientists or engineers
space,not_removed,yeah but tourism is about going to new places seeing new things
space,not_removed,for nihilists doesnt matter
space,not_removed,i think he means tom collins
space,not_removed,i heard he cant dance though
space,not_removed,but he was there and he saw what you did
space,not_removed,ive got two ears and a heart
space,not_removed,hey someone had to cut that record
space,not_removed,right tourism is the exact opposite of what he was trying to say
space,not_removed,for dogs woof woof bark grrrr woof arf arf
space,not_removed,and over on the right you can see expedition shreds you say
space,not_removed,why would there be how could there be we dont care about space exploration anymore the best you can do is the lunar reconnaissance orbiters shots
space,not_removed,we dont care about space exploration anymore i think youre in the wrong subreddit
space,not_removed,i know im not we doesnt mean us we means anyone with the means to do so
space,not_removed,some kind of newer picture newer than when from back in the day you dont like the ones from httplunargsfcnasagov it is a current mission still running as we sit here
space,not_removed,is it possible of course it is technically possible but ts just that nobody sees any point in spending hundreds of millions of dollars to do it even the chinese didnt land anywhere near an apollo site because theres no point if i had a few hundred million dollars to send a rover to the moon i would but i would not send it to an apollo site just to take a some silly photos there are still unexplored places
space,not_removed,i know these kinds of post get posted all the time but they never cease to amaze me the fact that we as a race have been able to take a horizon shot of different celestial objects is absolutely fascinating to me its practically unimaginable to me to be quite honest people always say that humans can imagine anything and my brother is a great example of someone who always says he can imagine anything when asked but just trying to imagine sitting on titan and looking out at the horizon is impossible without being there i wish we had a view of saturn from titan or neptune from triton just the idea that we are slowly inching towards these is such a brilliant though to me
space,not_removed,this exact image was posted literally hours ago and made it to the front page come on
space,not_removed,thats awesome how often do tgey launch them id love to see something like that one day
space,not_removed,there is a launch calendar httpwwwspaceflightinsidercomlaunchcalendar its an amazing thing to experience if you ever get the chance i highly recommend seeing one
space,not_removed,thats really cool thanks it would be a big effort for me as im in australia but one day
space,not_removed,melbourne here brother i feel your pain
space,not_removed,nz is going to have the electron not a big rocket but still
space,not_removed,whats the electron
space,not_removed,look here httpswwwrocketlabusacom new launch vehicle designed for small payloads but the cfk looks awesome launches should start in late or
space,not_removed,read this on my way home tonight preoccupied with school i completely forgot the falcon was launching today congrats to spacex this was after their first launch with falcon on march
space,not_removed,and here is that payload falconsat
space,not_removed,if you like science and the truth take a seat and
space,not_removed,aha amazing
space,not_removed,if you like science then you must understand that the statement you propose here has the same problem as you insist spacex has the rocket landed because first the pad was empty now its not i couldnt see the landing in real time therefore its not real i agree that its really annoying that they cant fix this issue by for instance having a separate tethered buoy with the satellite equipment but the fact that we cant see the landing is not by itself proof that theyre lying i agree that its circumstantial evidence but its not definitive proof what you can do is to try and find a live landing with the communication breakoff and the same landing only with retrieved footage they should be matching
space,not_removed,crack kills
space,not_removed,being blind to the truth will allow your captors to fool you continually
space,not_removed,it also helps if you dont include any information or source about the photo other than an astronaut on the moon
space,not_removed,it looks fake to me because i know nothing about photography
space,not_removed,and then the inevitable commenter who always finds a way to change the subject to spacxex
space,not_removed,well the sub isnt called rspacenews this is just as good content i dont see what you have against spacerelated stuff in a spacerelated stuff sub
space,not_removed,i find this more interesting than that stuff being posted ripped straight from nasas website
space,not_removed,glad im not the only person whos noticed this pretty sure people just treat this sub as easy karma
space,not_removed,these types of posts fit in the rules for the sub though at least there arent a ton of night sky photos all the time
space,not_removed,i didnt realize he was off the ground the first time i saw this image i thought he looked almost photoshopped into the scene and couldnt figure out why now i know
space,not_removed,and be double sure that you dont include any reference to the orig source
space,not_removed,theres no shadow beneath the astronaut this proves nasa greenscreened him in s
space,not_removed,i cant see the sun in this photo obviously taken in a studio
space,not_removed,why are there no stars
space,not_removed,id rather not have the opposite either it looks real to me but i know nothing about photography
space,not_removed,look for nasas accounts on flickr like project apollo archive they are putting relatively high resolution scans of all the slides and negatives online
space,not_removed,yes but relative to our advancements in space exploration it isnt current
space,not_removed,thats because theres just not enough space related content for a million sub
space,not_removed,the flag is moving there must be wind therefore no moon
space,not_removed,im no moon landing denier but his feet just look so fucking weird like they arent even touching the ground im sure its just the angle but still edit im a fucking idiot lol
space,not_removed,if youre really looking for the answer its that the camera exposure settings are set to take photos of a landscape fully illuminated in sunlight unfiltered by any atmosphere which is brighter than the brightest noonday sun on earth the stars are so dim that they get completely washed out and are invisible if you were standing on the moon you would have to look up and away from the sun and the surface of the moon and then wait for your eyes to adjust in order to see the stars however since thered be little or no ambient light since there is no atmosphere to scatter photons on the moon the number of stars you could see would be much greater than what you can see at night on earth
space,not_removed,and after looking its just a couple of steps to reupload them to imgur and get to the top of rspace
space,not_removed,what advancements apart from the iss what has advanced other than the number of probes i am sooo tired of were going to look at the water and dirtagain mars missions and resolution of telescopes
space,not_removed,i suppose this answer depends on what you define as advancement what qualifies as space exploration advancement in your opinion
space,not_removed,its easier to explain that by stating what doesnt qualify as exploration advancementsdoing what has already been done
space,not_removed,would you say that the delineation exists between human and nonhuman exploration
space,not_removed,human exploration is doa at this point in history which saddens me nonhuman exploration is going ok but do we really need endless trips to mars to research some fact about the water we already know exists there or should we save the money for a trip to europa what about a neptune orbiter or a lander on venus im aware the russians put a lander on venus decades ago but it was hardly a success break a new frontier instead of treading the same ground over and over thats all im saying
space,not_removed,just go into software engineering and buy a ticket to space when prices get more affordable
space,not_removed,keep going op dreams sent handed to people im sure becoming an astronaut is extremely difficult my advice is to look into join the air guard as a lot of astronauts have air force background keep going
space,not_removed,just keep applying man i hear it took some astronauts years of apps to be accepted the persistence is what they want
space,not_removed,being in a good shape is obviously important for astronauts but you dont need to be a world class skier you need to be intelligent you need to excel in your grades in a good shape and speak other foreign languages russian is a good idea is there a way you could get a pilots license scuba diving is not important flying even the smallest of gliders is a bonus also there is a psychological evaluation a friend of mine an aeronautical engineer and a national team member of a particular sport was turned down during the application process because of his everythingisacompetitionandialwayswin personality
space,not_removed,i really wish you luck with this i was an aspiring meteorologist until i found out the math required for it then that dream quickly died because of my inability to do math but i hope youre not like me and you dont give up
space,not_removed,where does it say anything about them buying an orion capsule i see a notice that theyre beginning construction on the next orion service module the support system for orion in space based on the same platform for esas iss freighters but nothing about them buying an orion
space,not_removed,cause this title is very poorly worded esa is not buying it its responsible for manufacturing of the service module you can find it mentioned among other things on esa website
space,not_removed,esa is not buying it its responsible for manufacturing i dont think this is accurate the only orion capsule construction im aware of is at the michoud plant in louisiana the esa is constructing the service module but not the capsule
space,not_removed,the longest wifi link was miles so theoretically you could communicate to a space vehicle in low earth orbit from the ground with wifi
space,not_removed,yes satellites transmit data wirelessly all the time how else would gps get to you or any satellite that provides tv phone etc services to the surface or spy satellites that send pictures of stuff
space,not_removed,actually this has turned into a bit of a thing with the iss originally it was hoped that there might be some signal received outside the spacecraft but it turns out the shielding is too good to allow that theyre looking at establishing an exterior wifi network around the station to allow very small payloads to be used without having to be completely wired into the stations data network
space,not_removed,apart from the american shuttle you can also see european atv and russian soyuz and progress docked to the iss
space,not_removed,nbsp im a bot please report any issue on httpsgithubcomopenseadragonredditbotissues
space,not_removed,unfortunately the video feed cuts off
space,not_removed,the logo in the beggining looks lik it says spycex
space,not_removed,terraforming mars is not possible for many reasons primarily because of its lack of a magnetosphere the fact that its moon phobos is in a degrading orbit and that any humans born there will never be able to travel to earth i do believe mars is worth colonizing because it has water and we can grow potatoes in its soil living under the surface is the best bet
space,not_removed,only the first one is a problem not only is phobos not going to be a problem for an exceptionally long time it might not end up being a problem at all if it breaks apart
space,not_removed,wrong thread
space,not_removed,theres a good deal of belief that a satellite positioned at the point of mars broadcasting a large em signal could block most of the solar wind
space,not_removed,hah you can fix all those problems easy peasy
space,not_removed,first one is not a problem atmosphere stripping is a multi million year process if we can restore and atmosphere we can supplement one
space,not_removed,but why downvotes for relevant issues should they not be discussed because they are inconvenient i just named a few problems instead of poking holes in my reasoning it would be more productive to start a dialog on solutions to the problems i have stated
space,not_removed,relevant to the picture its false advertising
space,not_removed,the theory is much more complex but if they can make it work then it would be great for spacecrafts and space stations as well
space,not_removed,doesnt a magnetosphere protect us from a lot of radiation though thats a big problem
space,not_removed,because terraforming mars has nothing to do with the thread subject reusable rockets are important for earth applications start a new thread on terraforming
space,not_removed,because a lack of magnethosphere is absolutely no problem if we would be able to actually terraform a planet because the moon phobos doesnt matter at all and because we cant actually grow potatoes on the surface of mars
space,not_removed,not such an issuemost of the shielding is from the actual atmosphere the magnetic field stops that protection being sacrificial early on we need to be underground for radiation protection either way
space,not_removed,potentially the curiosity rover on the surface of mars might be able to find micrometeorites like this and then look back into the history of mars atmosphere with them sounds really interesting does curiosity have the instrumentation to even identify if what its looking at is a micrometeorite
space,not_removed,i love when scientists say hey if we look at we should see then they go look and find it
space,not_removed,yes nothing like strong confirmation bias in your research
space,not_removed,dont call bullshit on things unless you have an understanding of the premise micrometeorites are common youre likely to have some collected in the gutters of your house right now
space,not_removed,micrometeorites like this are everywhere they even make up a component of household dust these are the oldest found not the only ones
space,not_removed,you got a lot of down votes but finding micrometeorites is something you can do at home you dont need many tools to do it either a plastic bag a strong magnet and a good magnifying glass is about all you need they are everywhere but are best found in places where there is old dustdirt because they get time to accumulate in the dirtdust of very old buildings in the gutters is a good place where they concentrate but just go outside dig up a small pile of dirt and drag the magnet in a plastic bag over and through the dirt and you will pick up any metal particles then you look at them with your microscope of lupe and you will see some are just metal and some a round smooth balls of metal these are the micrometeorites
space,not_removed,thats not confirmation bias thats the scientific method
space,not_removed,i think ill try that but i have doubts about if i will find any how long do micrometeorites last without rusting away in the yearly rain and snow are micrometeorites so rare that they are very hard to find in terms of having to send days and days searching for them
space,not_removed,grammar correction i dont know if there are others
space,not_removed,its also a big problem in science and it is not truly the scientific method one common term for it in science these days is mushroom hunting always come to mind on this subject your so convinced you know what you are going to find that you find it regardless of whether it is actually there or not
space,not_removed,here is a good start for you it is something i want to start doing as well httpwwwiflsciencecomspacehowhuntmicrometeorites
space,not_removed,the scientific method includes formulating a hypothesis coming up with an observable test and then conducting it this is literally how it works
space,not_removed,after musk sold paypal he was asked what he planned next he said he wanted to build human habitats on mars the reporters laughed they arent laughing anymore its just amazing
space,not_removed,all i can think issample return the prospect of this is the most exciting thing i can think of in my geeky grammar challenged mind
space,not_removed,when people talk about the motives for space project people always talk about the science and i love science dont get me wrong but sometimes the engineering gets overlooked getting two modules to connect on the iss or the skycrane that landed the mars rover is engineering sometimes you have to try things to see if it will work and get good at doing it reliably landing on mars with enough fuel to take off again would be a huge achievement even if no samples were collected even if it didnt take off again on another point id love to see agencies putting stuff up on mars that could potentially be helpful down the road greenhouses solar panels fuel
space,not_removed,yes weve been able to shoot stuff there for awhile but how about getting back to earth dragon couldnt even get out of the atmosphere let alone create another orbit for which to calculate the trajectory back to earth it would take a series of rockets to get something up there that could go to mars and back thats what i want thats what everyones interested in maybe we will finally get that sample return mission weve been dreaming about all these years
space,not_removed,dont worry a bunch of edgy redditors have proudly taken on the task of laughing at what that companys doing landing rockets the finest minds of reddit assured us for years it would never happen ditto with even flying the dalcon competing meaningfully with ula and deliver in cargo to the iss theyre hard at work in these threads laughing at the red dragon too just a matter of time until they show up so all is not lost we are truly blessed by their pessimism
space,not_removed,fortunately theres not a fixed amount of scientists hopefully this kind of thing will inspire many more people to want to work for either nasa or spacex and many more kids to study math and science
space,not_removed,nasa and spacex arent competing
space,not_removed,well i think by having an open and continuing partnership with spacex it wouldnt serve spacex well to poach nasa talent if it damaged its currently very beneficial relationship with nasa i mean spacex wouldnt exist presently if it werent for nasa the initial crs contract saved spacex from closing its doors so why would they poach nasa talent it doesnt make any sense also i think you underestimate the pride that an individual might feel working for nasa and i dunno the hours benefits and salary the entrepreneurial environment at spacex may be enticing to many people but theres more to it than just initial appeal
space,not_removed,there is a jpl presentation of just that basically the payload inside the dragon is the earth return rocket that would make it back to earth orbit with a soil samplerocks then another dragon would be launched to retrieve it from earth orbit we are still unsure as to what the reddragon payload will be either way very exciting
space,not_removed,we probably wont see a sample return until their mars colonial architecture is up and running in the but the landing will still be significant it will be about as heavy as all previous mars landings combined
space,not_removed,from what ive seen most of reddit has always been very optimistic about spacex
space,not_removed,could musk be an alien prepping earth for the arrival of his fellow kin
space,not_removed,i know we give him crap for being an alien all the time but his updates always sound so human too me he doesnt confidently walk up and read a script he just does a single take and says what he wants to and i think thats pretty cool
space,not_removed,or hes trying to get back to mars
space,not_removed,while a nice sentiment rosetta does not have sufficient fuel to reach jupiter never mind enter orbit in addition its solar panels are too small to produce enough energy to operate at jupiter the spacecraft had to be placed into hibernation for months during its last au aphelion pass because of power issues it just isnt possible
space,not_removed,and thats why theyre ending the mission theyre coming up on another hibernation period and they dont trust that the spacecraft will come out of it rather than let a dead spacecraft continue orbiting theyre bringing it down in a way that maximizes the scientific return visávis coming facetoface see what i did there with the comet a large part of my heart wants them to try for another hibernation period and i know im not alone a lot of folks are sad to see this amazing and dramatic mission end but i guess its better to guarantee going out with a bang rather than risk going out with a whimper
space,not_removed,while there can be disagreements over particular missions that kind of general opposition to nasa earth science projects is motivated largely by a lack of interest in knowing the facts that are developed from it how httpsenwikipediaorgwikiidiocracy became a legitimate political position in our society i will never understand
space,not_removed,damn republicans politicizing science spacebased earth science needs to be done and nasa is the best agency to do that if they want nasa to do more space exploration whatever they think that means add that to the budget
space,not_removed,this should be also linked to rpolitics no one touches nasa unless its to increase their funding
space,not_removed,weird how trumps pandering makes the front page but this is downvoted this websites alt right cancer is killing it
space,not_removed,clickbait article nothing in the article indicates trump is going to axe anything rest of the article is speculation based on current residing republican senators
space,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters last usagelow earth orbit last usagesolid rocket booster im a bot and i first saw this thread at nov utc ive seen acronyms in this thread has acronyms httpdecronymxyz httpsredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
space,not_removed,just a few more days of this false equivalencey bs trump is a non factor and irrelevant
space,not_removed,well on a bright side maybe the space exploration budget will increase so we can get out of here and get a compitent leader on mars or something i call dibs on the giant lazer well use to invade earth
space,not_removed,i will refocus its mission on space exploration he vowed under a trump administration florida and america will lead the way into the stars this this is so important nasa has been decimated under the obama adminstration we no longer have a means to get to our own space station and have to ask the russians for help meanwhile it seems like every other week a new global warming satellite is being launched i hope trump implements a permanent ban on any involvement of nasa in earth science research noaa has their own satellites and that is their department
space,not_removed,many of you will argue this but i say good turn their attention outward leave the environment to noaa nasa can send up the birds but noaa should be the ones monitoring and commanding them
space,not_removed,easy trumps main supporters are uneducated racist xenophobic sheep who bleat loudly when provoked
space,not_removed,even more irony is that the earth is in space so of course nasa is going to study it
space,not_removed,disagree completely noaa is far better suited to performing climate research its literally their job nothing about nasas charter or public image implies they should be doing climateearth science the satellites required for this kind of science should be funded and built by noaa and should be put into space by a party like spacex or ariane there is zero reason for nasa to be involved when people say space exploration they mean projects like juno dawn new horizons curiosity james webb hubble etc these are all projects that look outward anything looking inward does not belong at nasa a lot of people myself included would be far more inclined to put more money towards nasa if they utilized more of it on space related projects and less of it on earth related projects there are more than a dozen government agencies doing earth science only one does space
space,not_removed,damn republicans politicizing science oh the fucking irony spacebased earth science needs to be done and nasa is the best agency to do that why
space,not_removed,deport trump or something for the better good
space,not_removed,yep were all kgb agents here
space,not_removed,okay firstly learn to spell please secondly youre a hilary supporter therefore that means your opinion is about as important to this discussion as a fart thirdly a clinton isnt going to be the next president that twofaced thing you voted for will soon be indicted for those shifty emails you know the ones she bleached and had destroyed finally before you say im a trump supporter im gonna correct you here and say im a neutral party from a neutral place and i can see neither are ideal but shes the worse of the two
space,not_removed,what nasa needs is consistently the congress holds the cards when it comes to the budget the president just requests if you agree or not the the current administration biggest win is is getting the commercial side of space ramped up which has led to new interest nationwide we wont be buying seats from the russians much longer we will be swapping seats so there will always be a russian and or an american on each flight to the iss banning nasa from earth science is like getting rid of your control in an experiment you need it to compare it to everything else for perspective
space,not_removed,nasa has been decimated under the obama adminstration we no longer have a means to get to our own space station and have to ask the russians for help not true the constellation program under bush which although i would have loved to see actually come to fruition but the administration found out that it was essentially way too over budget and dangerous why strap the cev on top of an srb that vibrates enough to kill the crew and has already killed in bush had been planning on the russian help and retiring the shuttle since nothing you can blame him for meanwhile it seems like every other week a new global warming satellite is being launched because launching an unmanned satellite into leo is probably one of the easiest and cheapest feats in spaceflight not to mention youre wrong the last satellite was smap launched in early and the last one before that years ago in glory
space,not_removed,except studying the climate here on earth may help when it comes to studying other planets
space,not_removed,but thats not what trump and company are doing theyre not turning over the assets and funding to the noaa so that they can continue to do what nasa did theyre going cancelcut the earth science programs with no replacements
space,not_removed,nasa has the resources and expertise to do this so whats the point of dumping it on noaa thats not an efficient business plan
space,not_removed,using big words like that is just going to trigger them trump finds heliocentrism and geocentrism equally indefensible he believes earth and the sun both revolve around him trumpocentrism
space,not_removed,its been long since i saw a troll but there you go a mainstream sheeple
space,not_removed,noaa is far better suited to performing climate research its literally their job nasa is the reigning king of remote sensing nobody does it better than them not even noaa so it makes sense nasa would be involved in climate research too besides what is the practical downside in involving nasa in climate research nothing about nasas charter or public image implies they should be doing climateearth science httpsenwikipediaorgwikinationalaeronauticsandspaceact the original act charged the new agency with conducting the aeronautical and space activities of the united states so as to contribute materially to one or more of the following objectives the expansion of human knowledge of phenomena in the atmosphere and space httpclimatenasagovnasasciencehistory at the same time congressional leaders wanted to see nasa doing more research toward national needs these needs included things like energy efficiency pollution ozone depletion and climate change in congress revised the space act to give nasa authority to carry out stratospheric ozone research formalizing the agencys movement into the earth sciences in congress again revised the space act broadening nasas earth science authority from the stratosphere to the expansion of human knowledge of the earth a lot of people myself included would be far more inclined to put more money towards nasa if they utilized more of it on space related projects and less of it on earth related projects there are more than a dozen government agencies doing earth science only one does space while republicans like to promise more space exploration funding if nasa gives up on climate research its worth noting that while theyre doing this theyve simultaneously been trying from noaa too not to mention in reality they just want to end climate research in nasa and noaa and shoving it all into noaa makes that easier in the future for them there are more than a dozen government agencies doing earth science good climate change could affect everything from agriculture to defense so it should be studied from multiple points of view only one does space and they do a fine job of being able to handle climate research and space research i fail to see why this is a problem
space,not_removed,you dont know the meaning of irony nasa is the agency to do spacebased science because thats what they do why would they not do it they already have the entire science engineering contracting managing and telemetry set up to do that who else has that you want noaa to take over nasas mission to planet earth why would you do that the most efficient thing noaa would do in that case is hire nasa as a contractor to do the work
space,not_removed,dude if you are attacking spelling you are swinging at the lowest of hanging fruits its a typo we all live clinton is worse than trump for sure but he doesnt have the votes by any sense of the imagination i am jill stein supporter i will never vote hrc as she funded by monsanto goldman sachs and chevron
space,not_removed,trumpelina vocabulary retort verb calling someone edgy or a cuck
space,not_removed,get back in shitlerarrys vag kuk
space,not_removed,thats a really poor argument the earth science division of nasa should simply be moved to noaa issues with contracting is one of the major reasons a lot of people are wary of giving nasa more funding im not saying climate science shouldnt be done im saying that it should be done by the agency tasked with doing it nasa never should have been doing it to begin with
space,not_removed,you dont know the meaning of irony thats even more ironic nasa is the agency to do spacebased science because thats what they do dont do anything any other way because we already do it this way isnt an argument
space,not_removed,earth is a planet in space nasa is an agency concerned with putting objects in space to study planets and other objects out there theyve been doing mission to planet earth for decades and theyre good at it why spend the money to reorganize something thats working and risk having it break the only valid argument against nasas mission to planet earth is to do away with it completely people who want to shift it over to noaa know that noaa would never be the funding darling nasa is moving spacebased earth science to noaa is their way of defunding it entirely
space,not_removed,do you think irony is another word for stupid because if thats what you mean youre still wrong
space,not_removed,thats not what im saying and you know it
space,not_removed,lots of assumptions earth science just does not belong to nasaits supposed to explore the universe
space,not_removed,im going to flip that argument around on you the only valid argument for keeping nasas supposed mission to planet earth is because the only way you can get funding for it is by pulling a bait and switch youre fully aware that if people knew what the money was actually going to theyd be far less inclined to fund it which is why you want to keep it with nasa youre damn right that i know noaa isnt the funding darling nasa is thats the point i want the money given to nasa to go to programs that study things beyond earth i have zero interest in nasa studying things that a dozen other agencies and every university on the planet are concurrently studying if you think that noaa and earth science deserve the funding that nasa gets than you should be justifying that on its own not slipping it in as a piggyback on outer space funding
space,not_removed,thats not what im saying and you know it its exactly what youre saying you reject offhand any established alternatives much less new setups
space,not_removed,this way we get both mission to earth is important and is necessary if you want to do away with it im never going to agree to that
space,not_removed,im talking about business if you have someone whos an expert at something you hire them to do it you dont go with a newbie unless you have a reason to whats your reason you have none you just want to change for the sake of change but really its not even that you just dont want to pay for earth science that i can understand its stupid but at least its honest
space,not_removed,if you have someone whos an expert at something you hire them to do it you dont go with a newbie unless you have a reason to of course theres a reason whats your reason you have none great argument im sure people believe you now you just want to change for the sake of change sure i do which is why i said nothing whatsoever like that you just dont want to pay for earth science that i can understand its stupid but at least its honest he says as he invents his entire argument out of whole cloth
space,not_removed,and you have no answers just as i expected
space,not_removed,of course theres a reason what reason
space,not_removed,i have no incentive to answer your strawman questions
space,not_removed,then answer his original question
space,not_removed,youre the worst kind of troll
space,not_removed,from the article will unleash a feet electrodynamic tether designed to latch onto pieces of orbiting debris and drag them down to earths atmosphere to be incinerated currently working this week afterwards the cargo ship will deorbit and burn up around february
space,not_removed,full details of the system from the japanese space agency jaxa httpwwwardjaxajpengresearchkitekitehtml
space,not_removed,does the debris need to hit the tether in order this to work and then what
space,not_removed,it looks like it disrupts the debris with a magnetic field causing it to deorbit
space,not_removed,cool is any disruption good like either up down or sideways is all good or does it aim them a certain way
space,not_removed,no idea its just what i gleaned from reading the article
space,not_removed,the fact that the visible universe has a radius that is larger in lightyears than the universe is old plus the fact that the universe is in thermodynamic equilibrium on the largest scales gives impetus to the concept of cosmic inflation httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinflationcosmology this problem is referred to as the horizon problem httpsenwikipediaorgwikihorizonproblem long story short if you looked a distance equal to the age of the universe youd see a part of the universe thats younger than that because as far as we can tell the universe expanded more rapidly than the speed of light
space,not_removed,theoretically you would be looking into the past close to billion years ago but actually its not possible to look that far back since space and time did not exist before the big bang looking into dark regions of space the hubble telescope has captured images of galaxies believed to be only million years old corresponding to the youngest galaxies in the universe
space,not_removed,not the edge of the universe its expanding outwards in all directions at once so its more than billion years across simply put the universe isnt old enough for some light to have traveled to earth yet
space,not_removed,that is what is being done now with hubble and other large telescopes they are looking optically into the past about billion earthreference years and those early dim galaxies are about billion lightyears in distance it is a straightline approximation and using light in its particle form photons there are other satellite observatories like wap that are measuring the em waves of our present and that provides the distance to the cmb in our present about billion lightyears distance this is a simplified schematic of the universe each flat plane a time slice at the top is our present looking at the distant galaxies towards the singularity if the singularity is at and then we are billion lightyears in distance at billion earthreference years nasa has a similar schematic but it is constructed from empirical data and instead of an inverted pyramid the structure of spacetime is depicted more like a fluted cone comprised of the spacetime grid with time slices while we live in the universe we cant fully visualize it since it is at least an manifold and probably needs a manifold with relativistic effects to fully describe we can visualize time slices of our present essentially a capture in time the cmb is coming in from all directions this ends up being a sphere the physical universe of stars galaxies dust and gas of the present is contained within that sphere
space,not_removed,you would see more of the same a flat universe not much different from what youre seeing now
space,not_removed,you would see the big bang and its already been done probably before you were born the cosmic microwave background is what is left of the flash of light oversimplification from the big bang scientists study the shapes and patterns in it for clues about the formation of the universe it was first detected in by some bell labs scientists who were calibrating a microwave antenna
space,not_removed,if im reading the question correctly then as soon as you look up into the sky youre already looking that distance unfortunately light hasnt traveled far enoughhas attenuated enough that you cant see anything
space,not_removed,i would assume youd see past the edge of the universe if that is possible say the universe is x years old then the radius would have to be less than xlight years from the centre since the matter cant travel the speed of light soif from earth you looked towards the closest edge then you would see past the edge of all matter i think scientists of reddit is this correct
space,not_removed,your logics fair but the observable universe is billion lightyears from end to end due to expansion if you look as far as you can billion lightyears away youll just see darkness since the light hasnt reached you yet
space,not_removed,i understand that as well but the question wasnt so much about how far we could see but what we would see if we could see further
space,not_removed,so i was standing next to the rover the have on display at sch was just about to take a picture of the bulge on the tire then the tire just blew out
space,not_removed,i wonder if centuries later if we could excavate those rovers out of the sand and bring them back and put them on display since theyre a part of human history
space,not_removed,if this rover was operating it could lift the failed wheel and continue running
space,not_removed,which rover is that it looks more like one of the
space,not_removed,future martians will hopefully preserve them
space,not_removed,yes the one with the cabinhttpiimgurcomwltklkwjpg
space,not_removed,i swear i thought the front guy had a dog face
space,not_removed,they should preserve somewhat decently without a atmosphere its parts wont corrode if the sand buries them quickly they wont weather too badly
space,not_removed,yes thats obvious we have replicas and models of them but to have to ones the weathered space and the martian environment are priceless
space,not_removed,mars has an atmosphere if mars didnt things couldnt get buried in sand that takes wind the atmosphere is very thin and takes a great deal of time to move sand sand dunes can take years to move just a metre or two things can corrode in the presence of co₂ and moisture but martian air is very dry so that should be pretty slow moving too
space,not_removed,the reason for the red the iron rich permafrost cycles with just enough solar radiation to excite hydrogen attatched to the water molecules to a higher energy state enough for the iron to steal the oxygen oxidation at the existing rate it will take another eight billion years for the planetary superglacier to divide at the valis marineris into hemispheres
space,not_removed,credit to for posting link in a comment section
space,not_removed,thats roughly right the milky way is huge and is up most of the night now around now it is roughly at its highest around midnight in the usa in a month itll be at its highest around but anytime from should be fine during the summer look for a spot with a good view to the south especially and with as few lights in that direction as possible go on a night when the moon isnt up ie the moon is new or sets before it gets dark get a nice so you can oriented yourself however using a flashlight or even your phone will wreck your night vision so resist the temptation use a very dim red light if you need a light at all the mw will be way better after youve darkadapted for a little while binoculars will really add to the view too
space,not_removed,make sure youre in a dark spot away from big cities its so much more impressive
space,not_removed,get a nice planisphere so you can oriented yourself had never heard of a planisphere thats really helpful thanks for helping me out
space,not_removed,and this is why i tend to take any scientific article with a huge grain of sand if its title includes a question mark or some form of could or might what an incredibly misleading title nothing even close to life has been found theres a maybe to whether this planet is even habitable and the article has been based more on computer simulations than real observations
space,not_removed,another chunk of campo del cielo thats a bigun you can buy small specimens on the market nice meteorites
space,not_removed,in terms of crew we expect to be ready to fly our first crew mission in about three years technically if somebody were to stow aboard the cargo version of dragon theyd actually be fine i mean hopefully if it came back theyd be fine in the pressurized volume we actually maintain sea level pressure we maintain humidity we maintain the temperature very precisely because were trying to transport experiments that have plants and mice and fish and that kind of thing to orbit and back so you could certainly stow away and do it but in order for it to be really safe enough we want to establish a standard of safety beyond the space shuttle and anything else prior you really want to have a launch escape capability and you want to have lots of flights under the belt and tested without anyone onboard before putting people onboard the long lead for dragon version two is the testing of the launch escape system and thats what drives the three year time frame elon musk emphasis added
space,not_removed,theoretically but it would be useless for evacuation in practice because there is always a need to have the crew manually unberth the spacecraft and operate the canadarm cargo dragon has no autonomous dockundock capability
space,not_removed,dragon is a freeflying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting destinations spacex website i assume this means it is also good for reentry but honestly id wait for someone who knows what theyre talking about to verifydeny this
space,not_removed,you wouldnt even need the eva suit but it does hit the water pretty hard without a proper chair you would want to lay out padding
space,not_removed,the canadarms are operated by ground crew in houston though not by crew onboard the iss i mean they can be but theyre usually not so they could evacuate using dragon with grounds help
space,not_removed,yes the current dragon is the only unmanned supply ship that actually can and does safely return experiments and other cargo
space,not_removed,theyd also need to manually undo the bolts holding the dragon to the station the cbm interface was designed primarily to permanently attach large space station modules to each other and isnt undoable from the passive side basically youd need to evacuate the rest of the crew on soyuz anyway of which there are always docked in order to provide full crew evacuation
space,not_removed,this is huuuuge they are sending private citizens man i would like to go if i have more money too
space,not_removed,oh shit get your robes and wizard caps and meet me on the spaceship
space,not_removed,congrats on thinking up the largest perpetual motion machine ever dreamed of
space,not_removed,i should disclose i have pretty much no idea about space and how to travel tothorught it anyway looking at the falcon specs you get little more than of payload to reach gto than leo and at leo you are already in orbit so to get to gto you only need to increase speed is this concept right so could this work
space,not_removed,thats not how the magnets would work the blue train would just push the red into the earth counterbalancing any gains you made with the blue train youd probably be better off with a sort of railgun system perched on an asteroid that accelerates the train up into a higher orbit
space,not_removed,would this work better with laser propulsion satellites in opposite orbits firing lasers into mirrors on the other to accelerate each laser beam could be reflected back and forth multiple times
space,not_removed,oh it says electromagnets and electric powered in there i gave up on the perpetual machine a while ago i can say im proud to say ive been perpetual machine ideas free for xxxx days now p
space,not_removed,im pretty sure although not a scientist either that geo orbital speeds are actually lower than leo speeds in mph kmh terms wiki says orbital velocity needed to maintain a stable low earth orbit is about kms but reduces with increased orbital altitude but anyway if these magnets were in orbits that passed each other parallel to the earths surface and you could make these both into gigantic linear accellerators and you could control the resultinh accelleratons and new orbits to make sure they kept passing each other super close every orbit then nah i think theyll stick to throwing stuff out one end of a rocket
space,not_removed,i realize the way i draw the thing gives that idea i should note is not to scale either can we think it as side by side with forces that repeal and attract the trains against each other in equilibrium also some blues could attract some red and some others repeal so the trains are not pushed away from each other
space,not_removed,i was teasing it really is based on an old concept used in perpetual machinesthough if i am reading it correctly
space,not_removed,well i should have read about the orbits beforehand thats for sure what i was thinking is that once in leo for example if you keep going accelerating then you would start getting away from the planet because is like you are very fast and falling but if you go faster you escape more and more like a tangent line to a circle
space,not_removed,you cant trick newton pushing something up will push the other thing down by the same amount always always
space,not_removed,the problem i see us that magnetic force weakens incredibly quickly over increasing distance and a close approach in space is several km or more so the magnets would have to be absurdly strong like on a planetary scale on the other hand there are already satellites that use their own orientation and the earths magnetic field to adjust their orbits
space,not_removed,yeahhh i was actually thinking on the maglev trains but i get what you are saying
space,not_removed,i think so ie to leave orbit one would accelerate off on some trajectory that would look rather like you describe assuming the original orbit is more or less circular but yeah the magnet idea electromagnets linear motor i mean seems super hard to get right compared to rockets there have been ideas to use ground mounted rail guntype things to launch object but the gforces needed to accelerate to escape velocity are staggering not human safe
space,not_removed,see this httpimgurcomaumfmf is what i wrote in my previous response above can we agree that those forces are counter each other so the things are not pushed away in the undesired directions
space,not_removed,yeah thats kind of a dificulty i guess you could always get close in space considering the dockings to the iss happens at miless althought i have to reckon this aproximation would be a bit more challenging in a collision course d
space,not_removed,if the forces counter each other where is the gain in velocity coming from
space,not_removed,this is how the maglev train works as you can see the forces counter each other on one axis and work moving it forward in another
space,not_removed,that makes sense but in your idea there wouldnt be magnets on both sides to balance each other and the magnets on the outside wouldnt be stable youd need some kind of rails most likely
space,not_removed,well im not exactly sure what you actually would need and my idea is just a draft of spacecrafts pushing against each other using electromagnetic forces to gain speed and climb to the next orbit altitude no doubt the specifics are complicated d
space,not_removed,armchair astrophysics is more like it
space,not_removed,the total estimated data volume for the nominal new horizons mission gbits where a gigabit gbit shall be interpreted as bits this is equivalent to gigabytes gb where a gigabyte shall be interpreted as bytes meade p e new horizons data management and archiving plan theres a data return schedule in that document data is still being returned
space,not_removed,the source article has since been corrected correction an earlier version of this story incorrectly reported as roscosmos did that is the first year russia fell behind the us in launches in fact the soviet union was initially behind the us from about to and briefly again during the late still pretty cool though
space,not_removed,now if we just had our man in space program back which is necessary btw but prezs and congress simply like to ignore space as if almost all of the universe doesnt exist for them it takes a lot of ignoring to do that those who take the high ground in space will control the earth imagine a couple of high power electromagnetic cannons rail guns on the lunar surface with plenty of regolith to compact into fireable loads towards the earth itd take days to get spacecraft and missiles up there and only hours to hit the earth with rapid firing mass drivers from the lunar surface each with attitude rockets to make them target earth sites thatd be the end of those nations without lunar bases too bad too many are so dreadfully ignorant of such easily buildable and deliverable characteristics of such weapons it could make nuclear bombs on earth irrelevant hitting capitals launch sites nuclear power plants and other military targets at will with the forces of multi kt loads calculate the impact energy release of a ton load leaving the lunar surface at kps and increasing in velocity as it drives towards its target with earths gravity increasing the velocity multi kt loads and of course building mass drivers is justifiable in order to get ferrous and other metals cheaply to the earth what better way to hide those until its too late for the planet bound
space,not_removed,oh well like you say still pretty cool though
space,not_removed,additional firstlight data obtained with other exomarstgo instruments friend and lyulinmo is at the

space,not_removed,i agree i religiously listen to his podcast but sometimes he can get on my nerves
space,not_removed,being nice and worrying about peoples feelings just wastes time he doesnt have
space,not_removed,this is true with anyone you listen to too much
space,not_removed,it is possible to detect carbon on mars with opportunity through the laser ablation experiment but i havent heard much fuzz about it is it because there is little or no detection
space,not_removed,there is an interesting paper on the instrument data suggesting that it cannot be explained by nonbiological chemistry
space,not_removed,i dont know why but im incapable of perceiving depth correctly in images such as the one from mars odyssey only after inverting the colors or rotating the image degrees can i see rivers and basins when i look at images like this all i see are elevated areas even when i know that theyre not elevated theyre depressions anyone else with the same problem
space,not_removed,why would they sit on it there would be reasons

space,not_removed,why do there appear to be tracks or seeming evidence of flow in the cellular nitrogen ice plains
space,not_removed,i see what you mean i think they are more likely to be the result of contraction or expansion during temperature changes rather than evidence of flow some of them seem to be whorls reminiscent of fingerprints
space,not_removed,ah good observation that certainly makes more sense
space,not_removed,yes because all available historical data indicates he was you can always find dots to connect to cast doubt on an established historical fact
space,not_removed,really well if this is a serious question then my reply is required to be very sarcastic because the earth is flat duh
space,not_removed,i wonder if there are any affects associated with being in the sterile environment for a year sterile air food etc
space,not_removed,humans want to explore and feel that there is little left to discover on earth
space,not_removed,why would we not do one interesting thing because another thing is also interesting is that what youre asking
space,not_removed,humans are not just one person different individuals can work on a different things
space,not_removed,i just think off all the money we send in to space if just a fraction of that was sent in the ocean we could know alot more
space,not_removed,right now a lot of people want to get to another planet as a kind of backup for our species its entirely possible that life on earth could be wiped out by another extinction level event if we waited until we until earth was it could mean the ends of humans besides as a species there are billions of us why cant we do both at the same time
space,not_removed,because the people who want to search for other planets and the people who want to explore our own planet are not the same people
space,not_removed,you are able to write this post on the internet today because a person decided to discover something before everything possible was known about every previous discovery
space,not_removed,because its interesting and we can we dont have to choose between the two who knows if earth can ever be considered fully explored
space,not_removed,iv heard most of our oceans are unexplored who knows what under there
space,not_removed,rofl little left to discover of all marine species are unknown you cartographed the moons surface before you did earth´s humans havent been on the far depts of the ocean since ´s trieste adventure we know shit about earth its easier to be on the moon than it is to be in the mariana´s trench
space,not_removed,a fraction of it is spent on the ocean
space,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikibudgetofnasa we dont spend nearly enough money on space considering what a massive undertaking it really is and as other here have mentioned the two are not mutually exclusive we explore both the deep seas and the solar system
space,not_removed,we have decent maps of the oceans the us navy used sonar to make some maps decades ago discovered the midocean ridges in so doing
space,not_removed,of all marine species are unknown httpoceansiedublogonefishtwofishestimatingundiscoveredspecies you cartographed the moons surface before you did earth´s thats probably not true unless you pick a very specific definition of cartographed humans havent been on the far depts of the ocean since ´s trieste adventure in james cameron took deepsea challenger to the bottom of the challenger deep which is the deepest point in the ocean we know shit about earth nonsense its easier to be on the moon than it is to be in the mariana´s trench no not even close a few million dollars will get you to the bottom of the trench

space,not_removed,why have juno photos looked so crazy and turbulent even if this is from a polar perspective i thought the bands near the gsr were more welldefined
space,not_removed,aaaarg no units manwoman units use your units cubic meter cubic feet if you did have a sphere of cubic meters it would be only million meters in radius thats only km see this is why teacher had us show our work edit we need to fix this forget this size stuff its clear that octillion lawnmowers would undergo gravitational collapse into a fluid its equally clear that since theyre iron they probably wouldnt undergo fusion someone correct me on this if necessary the weight of a lawnmower is or octillion of them is kg vy canis major is star wins

space,not_removed,your friend is the best person i know
space,not_removed,galactic in this case meaning limited to their own star system so probably not galactic in the sense of spanning the galaxy or even in the sense of being in more than one star system so not really galactic at all

space,not_removed,this asteroid was very small meters the article also suggests were merely years away from not having to worry about a large wipe out from asteroid impact
space,not_removed,maybe it is going to hit us but they just dont want the public to know so we can live the rest of the time we have left in peace
space,not_removed,seriously would that help it seems the easiest httpsenwikipediaorgwikiasteroidimpactavoidancecollisionavoidancestrategies is launching nukes at it until it goes a slightly different way not only does it seem like several countries usrussiafrance seem to have the capabilities if they are not working together it doesnt matter if of the three fail if the third succeeds also most of these technologies get their largest development bursts due to not having peace
space,not_removed,the article suggests humanity is merely years away from being able to successfully defend against very large asteroid impacts
space,not_removed,wether we can make peace now doesnt really matter most countries when faced with the prospect of earth and humans dying would most likely band together and put other nonapocalyptic worries aside for the greater good of saving their countriesthe world wouldnt that be a good campaign slogan i saved the world from an asteroid lol
space,not_removed,wouldnt a meteor burn up in the atmosphere
space,not_removed,nukes arent that useful sure you can use one to alter its trajectory but a really giant rock isnt going to be moved very much this means you need to alter its trajectory long before its due to impact so that a very small trajectory change over that time ends up being very significant the problem here is that you need to observe the thing and predict its going to hit years in advance that means you need to have a very robust observation and detection system what we have now is at best halfassed theyre only using earthbased telescopes to look for these things and thats going to miss asteroids that are coming from closer to the sun what we really need is some spacebased telescopes in orbits nearer the sun looking constantly for asteroids and cataloging them
space,not_removed,probably depends on what its made of but i would think so
space,not_removed,its all about timing the right nudge in the right point in its orbit can result in it missing completely and if its far enough out aka we are looking at impact in years even the tiniest of nudges can mean it will miss tricky part is predicting it hitting the thing and seeing the rock early enough in the first place
space,not_removed,nukes arent that useful sure you can use one to alter its trajectory but a really giant rock isnt going to be moved very much this means you need to alter its trajectory long before its due to impact so that a very small trajectory change over that time ends up being very significant but from what i can see there is no better alternative for deflection is there for detection i agree that we should do better and working together could help
space,not_removed,well another idea ive heard about is sending a craft with an ion engine to land on the asteroid and use its engine to push it im not sure why this is supposed to be preferable to nukes but someone who understands things like specific impulse can probably explain it im guessing the nukes will waste most of their energy instead of it being used to directly change the trajectory and per kilogram of fuel maybe the ion engine will be more efficient but this still requires a lot of time beforehand
space,not_removed,but this still requires a lot of time beforehand not only the time for the ion drive to alter the trajectory matching velocities for a soft landing has iirc always taken years
space,not_removed,i could swear i saw this video before under the label of the earth colliding with a proto planet to form our moon
space,not_removed,you could also buy universe sandbox on steam and fully immerse yourself in stuff like this
space,not_removed,i wonder if anyone has modeled what happens to the atmospheres of the bodies during this
space,not_removed,this gets posted so often here to clarify this is the simulation of the impact theory about how our moon got here the theory states the earth was hit with a mars sized object and this simulation shows how the moon could have formed there was a whole documentary on it
space,not_removed,neptune you gassious fucker why are on a tilt and have rings that are off plane
space,not_removed,why does it start to spin in a different plane than they collided in by that i mean they collide left to right so in the xy plane if you will then it starts starts spinning in that same plane xy as i would expect then it slowly changes so that its rotating in the yz plane why is the collision more offcenter than it seems to my eye
space,not_removed,if the colors represent temp would it be possible to survive the collision by keeping within the blue zone
space,not_removed,at seconds you can see a moon starting to form but then gravity has other ideas and it gets almost extruded
space,not_removed,in real time approximately how long of a duration would the collision and the after effects take place
space,not_removed,and that is how babies moons are born son two bodies colliding
space,not_removed,this must be realllllllly sped up i think at that velocity the gravitation wouldnt be so strong
space,not_removed,i have as well from a documentary of some sort
space,not_removed,i highly doubt universe sandbox could render two planets colliding in that detail at best youll get some partial effect and one planet disappearing
space,not_removed,considering how incredibly small the atmosphere is here on earth i think it would be completely wiped out during an event like this and replaced by whatever gasses come out from collision itself whether that is gasses produced during the collision or gasses released from below the surfaces of each object in earths case lots of volcanic gasses would be released and we would most definitely be witnessing mass global warming and a new atmosphere that blocks of the planet from the sun eventually
space,not_removed,i think you have neptune confused with myanus
space,not_removed,the camera moves from one side to the other the actual objects themselves continue to move in the same direction they began moving in
space,not_removed,not even a little bit impacts of this scale would melt the planets crust completely and much of the debris ejected into orbit would fall back onto the planet as well causing thousands of secondary impacts over time
space,not_removed,its sped up by at an absolute minimum several thousand times
space,not_removed,maybe the planets were only a few centimeters in diameter
space,not_removed,its from a study on the subject that used extensive simulations with a technique called smoothed particlehydrodynamics fun fact the supercomputer that ran the simulations had as much compute power as a modern highend gpu
space,not_removed,like this
space,not_removed,i know but hey its all cool
space,not_removed,in the case of earth im curious what mechanism do you think would wipe it out theres a lot of nonvolatile nitrogen in our atmosphere which isnt going to react with the collision byproducts maybe the oxygen would be partially consumed by oxidizing metals some of the atmosphere could be lost to space as the heat causes it to swell such that the tops are more prominently swept away by the solar winds but in general i think it would probably stick around
space,not_removed,so youre saying theres a chance
space,not_removed,gravity still wouldnt be strong enough
space,not_removed,ah that makes sense and yeah the wonders of modern technological and manufacturing progress
space,not_removed,wow that was disappointing
space,not_removed,wtf was that garbage
space,not_removed,i think hes referring to the shockwave of the impact blasting the vast majority of the atmospheres gasses into space where they dissipate no doubt an atmosphere will remain it will just be altered from the original
space,not_removed,im not a physician physicist but isnt gravity relative proportionate if we scale up or down in size wouldnt they behave in the same way
space,not_removed,thats what i said when i bought universe sandbox too
space,not_removed,the best you can do without a supercomputer
space,not_removed,see i dont think the atmosphere is dense enough to get carried away under its inertia like that this is why i want to run a simulation lol
space,not_removed,no it isnt gravitation is a weak force even though youre standing on the giant planet earth you can jump up and down it doesnt crush you
space,not_removed,to be fair this animation is probably very intensive on the processor having it done real time with texture on the average persons computer or hell the powerful ones too probably and for at most is a bit far fetched
space,not_removed,thats not at all what hes asking he asking if you take large spheres that gravitationally attract one another and scale them down to maybe the size of a marble will they still attract one another the answer is obviously yes but as to what degree im not sure the scaled down objects need to maintain proportional massdensity to the original size though
space,not_removed,indeed but when leaving out realtime something like in the video should be possible the question is how realistic youre going to get it like in the video it shows loose particles instead of realistic materials that might behave in different ways eg water versus dirt the more factors taken into account with such a simulation the more time it will take to render
space,not_removed,everything attracts everything i took his question to be whether gravity gets stronger or weaker as you scale things up whether its two planets or two marbles colliding in space gravity would never be as strong as it is depicted at that speed above there is a gravitational constant
space,not_removed,hes asking about scaling obviously gravity will be scaled his question literally says will they act similarly the answer should be yes because gravity will also scale down
space,not_removed,thanks for clearing up some stuff let me put my question differently taking the video as an example of the shape of things regardless of what scale it might be could this video be realtime if the scale would be very small so does scaling down speed up what we see not sure if im asking correctly
space,not_removed,its a good question and one im not entirely sure of however there is a reason that we dont really see this kind of thing in nature so to answer the question in theory yes all things being equal and at a smaller scale physics is maintained and should react similarly we do all kinds of miniaturization testing for things here on earth aerodynamics of aircraft are a really big one however like i said we dont really see this kind of thing in nature because of limitations with size and density a planet is so large that it has the ability to be extremely dense the high density and mass of a planet is what creates the large gravitational wells once you start talking about smaller objects like a marble its much much harder to maintain densitymass ratios because there just isnt as much space available to pack enough mass to maintain a proportional amount of gravity i really dont know the answer though as i am not a physicist a physician is who you go see when you are sick p
space,not_removed,to properly and finally answer this question no scaling it down would not increase the apparent speed at which the objects collide this is because even though their mass and size is decreased the acceleration between them is also likewise decreased leading to a still very slow apparent contact speed and a good amount of time before they contact one another
space,not_removed,well if its a radio telescope then it wont record pictures as we see them with the naked eye it will be able to take a look through all the dust gas particles and filaments of old stars just like a satellite can look through clouds from above earth and detect heat sources for example this has been done in the past already but the quality is really low and the black hole is not visible at all so the astronomers had to look at the black holes surrounding to detect it by looking at unusual movements or effects from that monster please correct me if im wrong in my explanations but thats how im understanding it
space,not_removed,yea that makes sense haha i shoulda known so really its nothing to get to excited about then as the pic wont be that great
space,not_removed,oh it still is very exciting because we will get to see stuff that most probably never has been revealed before maybe not in hubblequality pictures but still amazing im really looking forward to it
space,not_removed,yea very true i just wonder now if well even actually get it in like they said
space,not_removed,on rspacex the rumor is the stage will be fired times in days full duration and this video is from days ago there was a test yesterday and today
space,not_removed,why is it that we barely see any rotation from the storms is the station just moving that fast
space,not_removed,minutes between full orbits so yes
space,not_removed,were still not looking at full speed here though right
space,not_removed,i think we are hurricanes dont really look like theyre moving while in space perspective from that high up and at that speed makes them look sloooow
space,not_removed,if i know anything about redditors its that they looooove huffington post articles
space,not_removed,to me the red dot looks like the plume from the rocket then a gap then the contrail develops but im on mobile so take that with a grain of sodium chloride
space,not_removed,nbsp im a bot please report any issue on httpsgithubcomopenseadragonredditbotissues
space,not_removed,mars would have to be as bright as the moon to be seen so clearly during the day
space,not_removed,from where was it launched and in what direction ive spotted mars recently in the ese part of the sky near sundown or just after sundown here in california for the damn bot that is blocking my comments go to hell i am not doing that too much ive made two comments in five minutes on two entries im tired of this crap now i know why i belong to voat and dont give a damn about my being in the top here i think ill remove reddit from my two cell phones
space,not_removed,im not on mobile and i totally agree
space,not_removed,yea i think youre right still a pretty cool shot i guess that gap shows the and stage separation
space,not_removed,launch time gmt pm edt launch site cape canaveral air force station florida
space,not_removed,thanks for the big screen confirmation
space,not_removed,might be staging might just be the temperature and humidity at that altitude
space,not_removed,im not a scientist or anything but i think because the atmospheric pressure is so low the temperature fluctuates high and low pretty frequently so water either just freezes or evaporates away i dont think theres a spot on mars that we know of with a consistent enough temperature to keep liquid water liquid it all turns into a gas or a solid
space,not_removed,you are correct pressure and temperature both play a role and in the case of mars the water will boil even though its still frozen this is known as sublimating turning directly from a solid ice to a gas even though it might be warm enough in some parts at some times of the year the pressure is so low that no water on the surface would last look up videos on youtube about how water behaves in a vacuum one good example is the mythbusters episode where adam went up in the dragonlady during their preparation they learned how to wear and behave in a pressurized suit under high atmospheric low pressure conditions in the vacuum chamber they had a cup of water as the pressure went down the water boiled
space,not_removed,at mars atmospheric pressure liquid water cannot exist its like dry on earth its either solid or gas never a liquid unless you put it under pressure the only possible time you could observe any liquid water is soaked into soils containing lots of boilingpoint affecting compounds for a short period of time after melting but never as a flowing stream
space,not_removed,correct me if im wrong but that was precisely the kind of streams spotted by mro
space,not_removed,they are but venus has an awful lot of atmosphere so it will take a very long time before it gets stripped away
space,not_removed,venus rotates just very slowly it actually rotates backwards for some reason so the sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east but something happened and it lost its dynamo so it doesnt have a major magnetic field this means that lighter elements like o h and he are constantly being stripped away venus is slowly losing its atmosphere its just that whatever happened to stop tectonic activity and the dynamo was recent enough that the atmosphere isnt completely gone as a side note venus does have an induced magnetic field caused by the interaction of its ionosphere and the solar wind its just not powerful enough to protect the planet
space,not_removed,venus does rotate once every days with respect to the stars in a retrograde direction and while venus does have a weak magnetic field in part because of its slow spin rate a magnetic field is not required for an earthmass planet to hang onto an atmosphere while a magnetic field certainly does help to shield a planets atmosphere from the erosive effects of a strong solar wind gravity also plays a very significant role in slowing such nonthermal loss processes which is one of the reasons why venus still has a substantial atmosphere while mars with a smaller mass and half the escape velocity does not despite the latter being farther from the sun
space,not_removed,venus has about the same size and gravitational strength as earth it is gravity that pulls the atmosphere in and concentrate on the surface higher density closer to the surface lower density further away that is the reason there was news about a helium shortage developing because helium will leave the atmosphere and dissipate into space mars didnt have enough gravitation to hold on to most of its ancient atmosphere
space,not_removed,uranus with an axial tilt of degrees has a retrograde rotation as does any other object with a tilt greater than degrees including the dwarf planet pluto with a tilt of degrees
space,not_removed,it would skim the surface of the moon what a fucking bullshitter a free return trajectory would get apollo levels of altitude above the surface that was kilometers times the distance the threshold to space is above earth apollo in fact holds the record for humans travelling the highest above the far side of the moon
space,not_removed,where are alll you trump bashers at where are you people saying this is to dangerous oh no this is terrible its gonna waste these peoples lives why would they do something like this if this happens on time which i kinda doubt it would be years before the trump challenge to nasa to do the similar mission and everyone went up in arms over that ridiculous hypocracy
space,not_removed,what do you think this has to do with the president
space,not_removed,this nothing i just think its kind of funny how a lot of people came out to bash trumps challenge to nasa to do a similar mission in years then spacex announces their plans to do it in and everyone thinks its awesome
space,not_removed,this nothing then why are you posting here i just think its kind of funny how a lot of people came out to bash trumps challenge to nasa to do a similar mission in years then spacex announces their plans to do it in and everyone thinks its awesome with respect i think this means you have a poor understanding of the differences between the two regarding flying crew on the first sls mission that will be the first flight of that rocket ever also it will be the first flight carrying humans in an orion spacecraft with this flight it will be on a rocket that has flown to space in a few different forms for years and the first crewed flights of the dragon design will also be under their belt if you are determined to see antitrump conspiracies everywhere you look nothing i say will change your mind but really it sounds like you dont understand the basis for criticism being levied against putting people on the first sls flight
space,not_removed,you are right i had read that but i forgot its hard not to think about anti trump conspiracies when its all hate all the time about him whether or not it was him or the acting administrator who said it if they do launch crewed i hope they have taken the right precautions although thats probably what a lot of people have a problem with is one of the precautions is testing the rocket without a crew you were right about this i was wrong hopefully they can figure out the best way to move forward
space,not_removed,i find really weird that both the camera on the rocket and on the landing pad blacked out dont get me wrong i am a spacex fan but somehtings fishy
space,not_removed,nothing is really fishy the droneship was much further out this time due to the high energy gto mission theres no way they could have brought continuous footage all the way down spacex has provided continuous footage before for both the onboard first stage camera and the camera on the ground captured the landing
space,not_removed,reporter bigelow after hearing that story a few times i realized there was a tremendous amount of things that we didnt know r when youre talking about things that we didnt know much about are you talking about alien activity b absolutely yes r do you believe in aliens b if you really bother to do the in depth research you come away with unequivocally that that is the only answer for all the various kinds of events that occur to people at very close range and that ladies and gentlemen is whats called burying the lead robert bigelow is investing in space because he believes were being visited
space,not_removed,i hope robert bigelow doesnt ruin the company even with the management problems they are having it looks like they could replace the iss for about or of its original cost
space,not_removed,i couldnt believe that even came up during the interview so random
space,not_removed,the management problems they are having wow i had no idea it was that bad bigelow sounds like the cliche boss of businesses with low skilled labourers cafes car washes motels driving employees like grunts confusing thriftyness with being cheap etc it looks like they could replace the iss for about or of its original cost thats according to his advertised figures we dont actually know if thatll work out also a good deal of the isss cost is due to operations not the mere existence of the station
space,not_removed,if you read up on bigelow a bit youll find you should be more surprised everytime he doesnt say something crazy about aliens the guy is nuts but rich
space,not_removed,i was thinking that it looks like bigelow can produce their stations for within a factor of of their advertised figures but you are right that i thought the billion figure was the construction cost of the iss when it actually includes operation as well
space,not_removed,another huge portion of iss cost is the massive cost to launch its numerous modules expandables allow for the same volume to be delivered with many fewer launches
space,not_removed,although you can see bits of it now if you know where to look youll have to wait until summer on a moonless night to properly appreciate it if youre set on trying google light pollution map and go from there
space,not_removed,i second google hours which way that changes the results but your timing is definitely off if you want the full experience its a summer thing
space,not_removed,httplightpollutionmapinfo you wont be able to see milky way on valentines due to the phase of the moon
space,not_removed,httpdarksitefindercommapsworldhtml
space,not_removed,go west guerneville ft bragg somewhere like that
space,not_removed,i lived in oregon house for quite some time and was also the first time i was ever able to view this not too far from you if i remember correctly cool town def worth a trip
space,not_removed,darksitefindercom a simple site that overlays on google maps to show light pollution anywhere in the world just zoom in around your area and find a good spot
space,not_removed,unfortunately bar is right plus the core of the milky way only really makes its way high above the horizon and therefore easy to be seen in the summer months im surprised shes never seen it though because if you live hours away from sac you probably arent too far from a relatively dark sky zone as buxtonwater commented try using httpdarksitefindercommapsworldhtml for a good place to go the darkercooler the color the darker the site is sorry this wouldnt work for vday but definitely try in the summer the milky way will make its way above the horizon first in about april or so
space,not_removed,thank you all for your replies everyone must see the milky way at least once in their life its such a beautiful site
space,not_removed,which is also worth a quick watch imo
space,not_removed,congrats to everyone on the team at spacex as well as anyone and everyone involved in this project another historic moment for space exploration
space,not_removed,yes everyone who is not a scientist and has no educational background on the subject is going wildprecisely because they dont know anything about it same reason why ufo sightings are much much lower amongst amateur astronomers because they actually know what they are looking at
space,not_removed,i blame irresponsible reporting the media should convey news in a way that doesnt oversensationalize so they can write clickbait headlines they are getting people excited for no reason and eroding the credibility of real science
space,not_removed,— its doppler drift rate indicates that it is exactly frequency stable in the frame of the center of mass of the solar system but me down in the skeptical but wish it were the real deal category but couldnt this criteria be a non starter if a signal were being broadcast to us specifically in mind i mean taking account the distance and needing to calculate where our star system would be a hundred years down the road relevant to them they could just modulate the signal to compensate no
space,not_removed,is the signal prime numbers because if it isnt prime numbers its not aliens
space,not_removed,exactly its never aliens
space,not_removed,yea ive on this before the the detected signal wavelength was cm that means its frequency was ghz maths at the bottom ghz falls at the high end of the httpsenwikipediaorgwikixband just bellow httpsenwikipediaorgwikikuband we use those frequencies for radar and directional wireless broadband links including satellite links a very strong signal only observed once implies something much closer something like a zombie satellite closer things look brighter and move across the sky faster i not even in astronomy but my own science background had me waiting until certain questions were answered unfortunately calmer words get drowned out when people go wild maths assuming a perfect vacuum the wavelength of light httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwavelengthsinusoidalwaves the speed of light in vacuum over its frequency λ v f fλ v f v λ f speed of light wavelength f m s cm f m s m f s f s f hz f ghz f ≈ ghz
space,not_removed,pretty sure if a signal came across and roughly translated to so you guys doing anything next thursday fancy meeting up we wouldnt just ignore it becuase it wasnt prime numbers
space,not_removed,and when it is one time people wont believe the scientists and say its faked
space,not_removed,and thats exactly what they want you to think
space,not_removed,so what does mean
space,not_removed,pretty sure aliens dont speak english nor use our way of encoding textsound
space,not_removed,hz cycle per second ghz billion cycles per second ghz billion cycles per second basically the hz is used to measure the number of occurrences in a repeating wave over time its frequency light travels in waves so it has measurable frequency the distance between these waves is called many people dont realize light has geometry to it but this affects its properties and how we use it now were back to where my last comment left off if we ignore the complication of things like air light at just over ghz has a wavelength cm heres a httpsenwikipediaorgwikisuperhighfrequency on what that means from a telecom perspective super high frequency shf is the itu designation for radio frequencies rf in the range between ghz and ghz this band of frequencies is also known as the centimetre band or centimetre wave as the wavelengths range from one to ten centimetres these frequencies fall within the microwave band propagate entirely by line of sight groundwave and skywave skip propagation do not occur although in some cases they can penetrate building walls shf frequencies occupy a sweet spot in the radio spectrum which is currently being exploited by many new radio services they are the lowest frequency band where radio waves can be directed in narrow beams by conveniently sized antennas so they do not interfere with nearby transmitters on the same frequency allowing frequency reuse on the other hand they are the highest frequencies which can be used for long distance terrestrial communication higher frequencies in the ehf millimeter wave band are highly absorbed by the atmosphere limiting practical propagation distances to one kilometer
space,not_removed,well thats the greatest thing about aliens we have absolutely no idea so chances are although crazy slim they actually could
space,not_removed,all ive learned is to fast forward through the acting parts i was so looking forward to this but its so bad meanwhile at the same time sci is running their mars special thats also an hour long and all science
space,not_removed,this show has been very frustrating every problem they face is the result of a deliberate choice to do things the hard way i wont reveal plot points but for those who have been watching the show consider how things would have been different had they been following the mars direct mission plan instead one thing i can mention without revealing plot points is that in the show this mission is a privately funded commercial endeavour the investors are terrified and demand a working colony on the very first landing or the project is cancelled this is crazy and illustrates perfectly what neil degrasse tyson has been saying about private enterprise in space only after the government has carried out the initial exploration will private investors be comfortable to operate on mars the show seems to depict a program of mars exploration as led by elon musk and spacex from the hardware down to elons inshow francophone counterpart faithful and devoted fans of mr musk should take notice of how this show reveals the significant flaws in this plan and the enormous problems spacex will face in leading the effort to put humans on mars if they try do it on their own with its in its current form
space,not_removed,science channel has a show about mars could you please give more info
space,not_removed,whats sci and where can i watch it
space,not_removed,i remember elon musk saying in his mar presentation that hell need the worlds governments to help him or his plans are never going to leave the drawing board or something like that
space,not_removed,this is crazy and illustrates perfectly what neil degrasse tyson has been saying about private enterprise in space i hope you recognize that its a show not a scientific simulation just because the author chooses to portray the situation this way doesnt mean thats how it would happen what you see as significant flaws that are revealed are just one perspective of how it could turn out but dont be fooled into treating it like a documentary
space,not_removed,oh yeah theyre running a new mars special the same time as natgeo but its way better all science kind of the same thing without the acting segments monday at on the science channel also how the universe works is starting the new season at the end of the month
space,not_removed,science channel same one that does morgan freemans throughbeyond the wormhole how the universe works etc im not sure but on directv its channel
space,not_removed,science channel
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,whats the show called edit found it it is called marsthe secret science for anyone else looking
space,not_removed,maybe this will help give more credibility to the purely materialistic theory of the origin of life if we discover that organic molecules capable of sprouting into more complex life are out there in our own solar system then a lot of the doubters will be forced to at least reconsider this is exciting stuff right here
space,not_removed,cool shot i think you need to do a dark frame subtraction to get rid of the hot pixels and probably shoot at a lower iso what sort of camera gear were you using
space,not_removed,did you know ir was coming or were you just in the right place at the right time with the right camera
space,not_removed,a lot of my friends and family have posted pics they managed to capture that night in utah and southern idaho your picture is by far the best ive seen beautiful picture
space,not_removed,yeah i was using a canon taking pictures of delicate arch didnt bother changing setting or anything i was just happy to get a picture
space,not_removed,right place right time i was out at delicate arch taking pictures of the milky way when we saw it at first we just thought it was an airplane until it started to break apart we were lucky
space,not_removed,thanks i was fortunate to be out that night and have clear skies
space,not_removed,on the contrary that light pollution through the trees makes this all the more interesting looks like you caught et getting up to his usual creepy alien shit in that spooky forrest over there
space,not_removed,wonderful shot i wish everyone could see views like this every night
space,not_removed,glad you made the artistic choice of leaving in the light pollution in the version you posted adds a unique layer to the milky way shot this would be incredible on a large poster or banner also that instagram edit a commenter posted is garbage i dont understand why people say i hope you dont mind that i stole your image and edited it instead of asking first
space,not_removed,i think light pollution has dulled our imagination that view has inspired many great men throughout history
space,not_removed,awesome i hope to go to the headlands in northern michigan although i lack the equipment and skills to take a shot like this which park was this props
space,not_removed,this is a dark sky site sure does look like a lot of light pollution to the left
space,not_removed,i wish it were that interesting just a car pulling into the lot but i love how spooky it looks with the crepuscular rays
space,not_removed,agreed its a real shame that you have to go through such lengths to see the sky nowadays i had to drive for four hours to get this plus camping completely worth it but the numbers alone are a bit sobering
space,not_removed,shots like this make me wonder what im doing with my life i worry about work but if i saw this it wouldnt even cross my mind
space,not_removed,this was olympic national park in washington state on the west coast of the peninsula
space,not_removed,a car pulled into the parking lot and illuminated the fog i thought it looked pretty nice normally it looked like this
space,not_removed,that looks terrible you went completely nuts with the editing id prefer if you took that off your instagram
space,not_removed,hey honest question here im new to photography and just bought a canon am i able to capture photos like this with my camera and the stock lenses it came with or would i need a higher quality camera and or lenses
space,not_removed,yeah you really get a sense of how small you are where was this at it looks beautiful
space,not_removed,ive been camping every chance i get for the last year spent many nights on mountains and in prairies and bogs wouldnt trade that time for all the money in the world
space,not_removed,it does looks nice just doesnt seem to reflect no light pollution
space,not_removed,ruby beach on the olympic peninsula in washington absolutely gorgeous area
space,not_removed,well one pair of headlights arent light pollution
space,not_removed,i like sailor moon as much as the next straight guy out there but do science articles really need to have pop culture references in their headlines like this
space,not_removed,on a side note for additional hilarity look at the right picture see that dish shaped thing thats the protective lenscap that was in front of the camera now look at where the cap ended up in the left picture
space,not_removed,you might be melted first as the atmosphere has a very high concentration of sulphuric acid
space,not_removed,you know what would have been cool if venus was like earth its unfortunate that its an uninhabitable hell hole but it has roughly the same size and mass of earth and is at a distance from the sun that would allow life to emerge imagine if an alien civilisation evolved on venus the space race would have turned out quite different we would have gone there exchanged technology probably started a war but it would have made space exploration and the history of our species much more interesting
space,not_removed,these actually are colorized pictures from my understanding it seems that the only two pictures we have from venus with some color information were from venera and you can see them there or even better and these are still heavily processed pictures the one from op are simply colorized versions of these composites from don p mitchell from venera but we did not color images from venera
space,not_removed,atmospheric pressure is just the weight of the gas around you since weight is a downward force of gravity on an objects mass this puts being crushed at the speed of gravity as for being cooked a lot slower since the type of heat transfer is convection instead of radiation according to article the convection velocity of venus is m sec which is slower than the speed of light tldr dont go to venus
space,not_removed,the pictures look just like star trek tos episodes where they go down to a planet and its just backlit with a
space,not_removed,i always wondered what would happen if hypothetically you could vent out all of the sulfuric acid along with atmospheres of carbon dioxide leaving a single atmosphere that wouldnt crush a human what would the average temperature be
space,not_removed,the melting would accelerate the weakening of the pressure vessel so its basically a meaningless question whether it would melt or be crushed first the moment the melting weakened structural integrity beyond a certain point it would be crushed the timing would look very different if it was the same temperature at earth pressure or the same pressure at c
space,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters used in this commententrydescentlanding used in this commentmars science laboratory curiosity im a bot and i first saw this thread at aug utc httpwwwdecronymxyz httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
space,not_removed,im confused whats funny so funny about that
space,not_removed,if theyd left the lens cap on you wouldnt be seeing any picture i guess popping it off was the correct move
space,not_removed,must not get pedantic about definition melted phew
space,not_removed,the clouds have a lot of sulfuric acid droplets but on the surface its just a component of the supercritical fluid although supercritical states can act as solvents the rate of corrosion would be slow compared to pressure vessel collapse and melting
space,not_removed,i just want to point out that venus is actually too close to the sun for life to emerge on the surface even considering the more optimistic ranges for the goldilocks zone around our star it simply receives too much light and heat from the sun per square meter to allow liquid water to exist on the surface for long periods of time eg more than a few million years starting from formation the amount of heat it gets causes enough water vapor to evaporate that it increases the amount of heat trapped by the sun to increase further strengthening the cycle to the point that the temperature reaches more than degrees c or until it reaches a lower temperature but all water has evaporated at this point the planet has no chance of cooling off barring some kind of reduced output of the sun and in fact would continue to heat up as the interior of the planet continued to release gasses like carbon dioxide more water vapor and so forth which would continue to thicken the atmosphere for billions of years interestingly one big difference between the earth and venus is its lack of any tectonic activity despite the fact that venus should be big enough to support the process as it turns out having large pools of water oceans early on in the formation of a large rocky planet like the earth or venus may be vital in allowing the planet to form tectonic plates which in turn is very important for the planet to develop a carbon cycle in which the emitted by the planet can be reabsorbed by the oceans deposited as minerals on the sea bed and subducted back into the planet preventing the massive eventual buildup of atmospheric gasses the presence of water in the plates that are subducting also appears to speed up the process keeping the carbon cycle robust its worth noting also that nitrogen is continually released but is not reabsorbed very effectively by the planet allowing it to build up nitrogen is fortunately for life not as common as carbon so it can build up for billions of years with little consequence most nitrogen was released on earth and on venus during their formation and has very slowly increased since by perhaps a few percent now lets say venus and earth while were at it formed slightly farther out from the sun venus now orbits near the inner edge of the habitable zone closer than earth did and earth maintains the same orbital height it did in our current solar system so it has moved slightly outwards not enough to cause any noticeable difference in temperature for life venus along with earth formed liquid oceans early on in its history and has steadily been subducting oceanic crust growing new continent landmass as lower density rocks are erupted as they float from within and maintaining an active carbon cycle its atmosphere is thicker than the earths mostly nitrogen and sits at around bar of pressure because of its thicker atmosphere and proximity to the sun compared to earth venus is a mostly tropical world with a very humid atmosphere and no ice caps the poles do get chilly but rather than snow there is a near constant downpour of cold rain as warm moist air flows north and south from the equatorial oceanic regions and colder dryer air flows back any landmasses big enough near the equator would generate heat islands in their interiors similarly to australia thus turning large areas of landmass into extremely hot dry landscapes erosion in the temperate regions would be extreme with the torrential rains washing out huge river basins and cutting through the landscape unimpeded by vegetation the mouths of these rivers by extension would have huge flat deposition zones where sediments carried by the water fall out of suspension and build up the warm tropical oceans would generate large hurricanes from all the heat energy stored in the water which would inundate any smaller landmasses they passed over the thicker atmosphere they occurred in would also have them literally blowing boulders across the landscape and would probably result in very alien looking wind and rain sculpted terrain im going to say that in such an environment life could certainly develop and thrive however im not going to speculate too much upon it because even the familiar life on earth is incredibly complex and unpredictable my intuition would say that ocean life would do very well because of all the nutrients and strong ocean currents desert life would have a difficult time surviving vegetation or its venusian analog would probably grow less tall than on earth due to the much stronger winds and rains and flying animals would have a much easier time flying as long as it wasnt currently hurricane season maybe the venusian environment would be much more favorable to the flying fish body plan since aquatic animals could easily escape harsh storm conditions but with the thicker atmosphere and humid air be able to soar and not dry out for long periods who knows anyway ive probably gone off on enough of a diatribe so ill end it with this venus was most likely so close to becoming a habitable world but unfortunately it was just a bit too close to the sun and it ruined everything
space,not_removed,i saw this alternate timeline once where mars was replaced with a habitable planet no intelligent life but there were plants and animals similar to many found on earth like wolves
space,not_removed,it might have been millions of years ago and that civilization as far as we know could have sparked that runaway greenhouse gas effect
space,not_removed,yeah but the temperature becomes dangerous far quicker than the pressure when you reach earth sealevel pressurd the temperature is degrees on a side note that speed of light thing for crushing is incorrect youd be crushed at the speed at which the atmosphere and your body can move inwards which certainly isnt the speed of light
space,not_removed,instructions unclear went to venus
space,not_removed,venera and took black and white photos each venera and had color cameras but they failed to eject their lens caps venera and successfully returned color photos each this post shows one image from venera and one image from venera so no not fake
space,not_removed,no im pretty sure these pictures are from soviet venera project which took pictures in color
space,not_removed,the arm you see is an instrument designed to test the composition of the venetian surface instead it dug straight into the cap
space,not_removed,he left out the important part that arm is supposed to touch the ground to get readings but in the left image the cap that pops off the camera landed right where the arm was supposed to touch so it essentially ruined any readings they got
space,not_removed,it was supposed to protect the camera it ended up dissolved in the acidic atmosphere leaving the camera exposed it turns out the camera was more sturdy than its protector
space,not_removed,out of the pedant pan into the smug
space,not_removed,anyway ive probably gone off on enough of a diatribe you should do this more often that was an interesting read
space,not_removed,thanks for this informative post i learned something new
space,not_removed,extremely doubtful since all the data weve gathered so far says that venus because a hothouse planet billions of years ago soon after its formation
space,not_removed,i read about a study where they sought to answer the question of weather or not we could screw up and make earth like venus it turns out that we dont have access to enough fossil fuels to do it however if we started burning limestone which is pretty difficult we could do it httpwwwscientificamericancomarticlefactorfictionrunawaygreenhouse
space,not_removed,whoops i was considering how fast it would take before interacting with someone teleported to the surface of venus in short just being exposed to the gravity vs being exposed to degrees f i didnt even take into consideration impulse forces or gradient heatpressure differentials thanks for correcting me
space,not_removed,looks as though you didnt find the sun
space,not_removed,what if you lived at the poles still too hot
space,not_removed,the distance from sun not determining the planet temperature the atmosphere did mercury have a thin atmosphere therefore the other side of mercury is very cold yet the other side is very hot but venus have very thick atmosphere that could trap the heat from sun but the heat cant escape venus and human colony can exist in venus if we live in floating city
space,not_removed,why all the money for these probes for photo each
space,not_removed,that event proved that murphys law works on venus
space,not_removed,no the lens cap was intentionally ejected to uncover the camera viewport after protecting it during the descent the camera was seated inside the armored hull and looked out through a small periscope the funny part is the lens cap landed right under the surface probe preventing it from returning useful data this was the final act in the venera programs curse of the lens caps on veneras and one of two lens caps on each probe failed to eject halving the planned photographs a fix was implemented for veneras and but this fix ended up with no lens caps successfully ejecting on veneras and they finally figured out how to reliably eject the lens caps the lens caps were undeterred and one managed to hamper the mission anyways by blocking the surface probe by pure freak coincidence or was it dont mess with lens caps
space,not_removed,venetian gravity is not that high actually
space,not_removed,i found and its awesome up here reporting from venus
space,not_removed,poles dont make a difference but if you live on ishtar terra where maxwell montes is about km higher up the atmospheric pressure is a rarefied bars instead of and the temperature drops nearly degrees soits a little better
space,not_removed,well since they didnt move around there wasnt much to take pictures of just the landing site they also had plenty of other instruments taking measurements
space,not_removed,why not oh i dont know attach a string to them so they dont get in the way on the ground
space,not_removed,i was referring to my original post with the hypothetical premise of venus with one atmosphere instead of
space,not_removed,well i mean one picture per a lander not multiple
space,not_removed,have you ever heard of hindsight thats what this is
space,not_removed,a string that maintains its material properties at and times earth sea level pressure i assume good luck i guess
space,not_removed,i seem to remember seeing the number degrees in that situation though i dont remember where we wouldnt need to vent atmospheres though because of those regions i mentioned whatever brings them to earthlike atmosphere and temperature would be enough to start living on the highest parts of the planet as far as i know there is no difference on the poles and very little difference on the night side as well so high in altitude is the only way to go not high in latitude
space,not_removed,both venera and did take at least two pictures which were then used to create a wideangle panorama of their landing sites theres no reason to take more pictures after landing and the probes didnt last long anyways
space,not_removed,neither lander nor csmera can move why photograph the same thing repeatedly
space,not_removed,whatever a steel cable you could coil it in the lens cap itself so that it is protected during edl it doesnt have to last eight hours it just has to keep the lens cap out of the way of the surface probe
space,not_removed,how could there be no difference in temperature from the poles to the equator earth has a noticeable temperature range from the poles to the equator shouldnt there be at least a subtle difference on venus even at one atmosphere of pressure
space,not_removed,ok then id ask why was the camera fixed
space,not_removed,do you really think the soviets didnt think of that the people who build this type of machine are usually pretty smart we often see rube goldbergesque solutions like msls edl procedure to what appear to be incredibly trivial issues but theres a lot of reasoning behind those solutions
space,not_removed,venus is not a nice place the camera peaked through a small hole in the heatshield allowing it to move would require a bigger hole
space,not_removed,this also the landers did not last long at all need to send more science back in the limited time than just pretty pictures
space,not_removed,to elaborate the cameras actually looked through a periscope that peeked through a small hole in the armored hull
space,not_removed,you wont regret owning a copy you will use it far beyond your project
space,not_removed,i just cant find one anywhere that isnt grand
space,not_removed,when i see this im okay that little p was downgraded but only when i see this pic
space,not_removed,imagusco blogspam the op just takes images that were already popular on reddit and pastes them onto his blog then he inserts a bunch of ads original thread
space,not_removed,so what you are saying is there is room for all the poisonous snakes and spiders in australia on pluto
space,not_removed,so is the takeaway that pluto still has more total land area than australia or that we should drop a minor planet on the whole place and be done with our embarrassing downunder problems that like to flare up now and again yknow down there
space,not_removed,so we should push for australia to be classified as a dwarf planet
space,not_removed,thats not a planet thats a planet
space,not_removed,we should just build a giant thruster on pluto and bring it into orbit of the earth as a second moon
space,not_removed,woah pluto crashed into australia and i didnt even see it in the news some news stations need to pick this up fast this seems like a big story people need to know
space,not_removed,similar size similar wasteland everything checks out boys move all that deadly shit over to that moon
space,not_removed,these comparisons are always fun but are somewhat meaningless because terrestrial continents are not wrapped into spherical surfaces if australia were detached from earth and wrapped into a sphere it would look a lot smaller than pluto and conversely if pluto were unwrapped into a flat surface it would be much larger than australia
space,not_removed,they appear to be the same size but pluto is larger due to surface area yes
space,not_removed,im ok with it everytime i see its orbital path in relation to the rest of the solar system
space,not_removed,theres also pluto compared to our moon
space,not_removed,there is much more water available on pluto than there is in australia
space,not_removed,it has more land than russia too surprisingly
space,not_removed,wed also be done with the whole demotion debate too sounds good to me
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,even tiny asteroids can have moons theres even an asteroid with rings like saturn
space,not_removed,or crash it into venus in an attempt to terraform it
space,not_removed,i think if pluto hit earth we would be dead before we could read or create a news story about it
space,not_removed,no its just an illusion caused by pluto passing between the sun and the earth
space,not_removed,httpwwwlunarplannercomimageseriseriseclipticgif i guess it makes sense for the goddess of mischief and discord
space,not_removed,planet if its real its as big as neptune and it is in a inclined highly eccentric orbit though
space,not_removed,well trade snakes and spiders for their water
space,not_removed,nah plutos original estimate was wrong where russiapluto pluto is bigger russia area sq km crimea area sq km russia crimea area sq km plutos area sq km
space,not_removed,better idea make it a moon of venus transport water to venus throw some of plutos moons into venus to speed up rotation and hydrate the planet
space,not_removed,if anything thatd make venus worse
space,not_removed,thing is its not recognized as a planet so planet is a misnomer and the irregular orbit doesnt help it or plutos case as a planet rather it more solidly implies its place as a transneptunian object hey i didnt come up with the name but it is what it is
space,not_removed,any planet would have an orbit that it too large for it to be a planet
space,not_removed,they will mutate and come back with a vengeance one day
space,not_removed,well australia would would pluto be absorbed if it was just lowered
space,not_removed,any planet that orbits the sun is massive enough to be round and cleared its orbit would be considered a planet and planet according to calculations is doing a pretty fine damn job at clearing it
space,not_removed,kinda like hulk did in the planet hulk comicmovie
space,not_removed,it would break apart and melt under earths gravity as soon as you let go so it would turn into something like an apocalyptic icecream scoop broken or melty parts would still crash to earth once you turn off the ultra tractor beam just not at orbital velocities i havent done the math or physics but im sure its enough mass to drastically alter the earths rotation im thinking after a few years of a lot of wobbling and catastrophic tectonic shifting mount plustraliadongabongabout will define the new equator i definitely need some math now but it would have an effect on the moons orbit with the sudden increase in mass on earth it would shift it into a more eccentric orbit at least and maybe destabilize it entirery im thinking its not quite enough mass for that though regardless we would have a bad time
space,not_removed,nbsp im a bot please report any issue on httpsgithubcomopenseadragonredditbotissues
space,not_removed,watched it last night on vacation at ocean shores washington flew right by jupiter man that sucker moves
space,not_removed,always blows my mind to look up at that little dot and realize its a fucking space station
space,not_removed,really weird because i was also in ocean shores last night and saw this post and was wondering if what we saw was the international space station so i went to check the comments and of course saw your comment very small world
space,not_removed,crazy small world mars was pretty cool too best part of the weekend was the sun on sunday as seattle was socked with clouds all day long incidently showed up to work today looking like a bright red tomato saw someone at the convention center on saturday wearing a spacex tshirt its the last place on earth i would expect to see anyone wearing a shirt like that
space,not_removed,article about purple rocks detailed description of an image the rover took no image of purple rocks but an image of mars from orbit
space,not_removed,my first thought was there is no possibility that an article wholly dedicated to an image would not at the very least include an image i was wrong
space,not_removed,thank you now i want to come up with a color palette based on mars i see some lovely bluishturquoise too
space,not_removed,dear god its an alien albuquerque
space,not_removed,the right stuff was one of the best books ive ever read then chris hadfield book is a good recomendation too
space,not_removed,opening the high frontier available on amazon books great read shows how spaceflight can be made affordable to everyone using existing technology the high frontier available on amazon books another great read talks about space colonies and the building of a space based civilization
space,not_removed,packing for mars by mary roach is a great read it covers loads of interesting topics from early to current spaceflight
space,not_removed,ula certainly seems to be trying to leverage their heavy lift vehicle into being a cash cow but i am for anything that helps increase space infrastructure manned presence and in situ resource utilization like you said orbital propellant depots allow chemical rockets to economically fly to cislunar space or to mars
space,not_removed,wonder if there will be danger payand what will the benefits be like
space,not_removed,im hoping profit motive will help move us forward in opening a new frontier if ula can make a tonne of money developing space infrastructure more power to them however im not optimistic theyve been floating grand schemes for their aces propellent tankers for a long time now if they make it past the power point hardware stage ill be pleasantly surprised
space,not_removed,most of action going on is leo meo and geo the orbits under the moon but yeah is an interesting location as well maybe earthmoon neighborhood would be a better description of the region they want to serve but for brevitys sake cislunar will do
space,not_removed,why are you insisting on being transexclusionary right now
space,not_removed,god i hope youre one of the two people going on this flight the everyday astronaut finally realizing his dream to anyone hoping to burst my bubble just let me dream
space,not_removed,because its internet trash can everyone talks about everything no one cares
space,not_removed,is getting divorced from his actress wife talulah riley for the second time who wouldve thought that the man who seriously believes he can send colonists to mars within our lifetime would end up being a hopeless romantic
space,not_removed,a second time excuse me how could this man not be smart enough to protect himself after the first divorce
space,not_removed,i would agree but id only be shitting on myself sigh
space,not_removed,the astronauts would be advised to observe the alien life from afar for a prolonged period we would study their day to day operations for signs of peculiar variables in dietary habits to see if they have cultivated a more efficient cropstock we would study their social hierarchy to best ensure we know which faction if applicable holds the most power edit it goes without saying that we would attempt to measure the offensive capabilities of the alien faction more so as a defensive precaution it would be decades of ranged study before communication would purposefully be attempted even then only if we identify something in their culture that we deem worth the risk to trade for ie portable and clean energy
space,not_removed,i doubt they would study them for one main reason even if they are not evolved they would probably notice athe landing
space,not_removed,stargate kind of demonstartes it d not accurate but close enough
space,not_removed,they would immediately turn to reddit to ask vague and open ended bullshit questions about what they should do
space,not_removed,what if the alien civilization were extinct and all that was left was remains archeological and paleontological also what if it was more simple life like cambrianlevel life
space,not_removed,i like to think we would do it the sensible scientific approach way i have a feeling though it would be more like capt jonathan archer of the enterprise and just go cowboying in there shaking hands with whatever appendage stuck out the most i miss tpol
space,not_removed,what about life that isnlt civilized
space,not_removed,the answer there would be to study the extinct alien life how they lived day to day the social hierarchy they had or lack of and the technologies that they developed more importantly we would study how and why they went extinct so that we can learn from whatever happened to them and try to avoid making the same mistakes
space,not_removed,as with so often the answer is lasers use a highenergy laser to push space debris into an orbit that takes it closer to the atmosphere which will cause it to fall out of orbit in short order later on for defunct geostationary sats and other highorbiting sats we could use a sort of spacegarbage truck that collects them and then stores them at some sort ofspacefill basically a space station designed to recycle space junk sats contain some very valuable materials if we get space manufacture up and running some time itd be a shame not to use them
space,not_removed,im starting to wonder if well be able to soon enough and efficiently enough to keep up with anything that were adding maybe if some countries didnt test deorbiting weapons on spacecraft s seriously though this is a real issue humans love to leave their trash everywhere we go so we need to find a way to undo the mess weve been making
space,not_removed,my solution launch a nanobot factory into orbit and let it scrap and collect all the junk in orbit and eventually have it all come back down and land
space,not_removed,could we just set off a nuke and blow them out of our orbit or naw
space,not_removed,what about some sort of electromagneticstatic charge broom to sweep stuff down into the atmosphere where it will burn up
space,not_removed,even once we find a way to collect large amounts of it in a go the question will then be what to do with it do we bring it back and try to recycle it or do we use the sun as a spaceincinerator and launch the debris towards it
space,not_removed,you make a powerful laser track small pieces you want to eliminate fire now its vaporized track big pieces fire in just the right point that the evaporation causes the object to slow down wait for it to fall back to earth what am i missing
space,not_removed,an enormous amount of space exists within our immediate orbit so much so that rocket launches can accomodate with relative ease space junk isnt a problem many many years from now it may become a nuisance
space,not_removed,its a shame we dont have any of that tech if we did we would build spacecraft in orbit too
space,not_removed,tests have shown that there are serious httpsenwikipediaorgwikihighaltitudenuclearexplosiondrawbacks caused by setting off nukes in orbit
space,not_removed,magnetism and static has been proposed just remember not all space junk is metal and since the stuff is moving so fast static is hard
space,not_removed,you cant just launch things at the sun its actually really hard to go straight into the sun i cant remember exactly why though
space,not_removed,deorbit it quickly so as to stop further debris generation
space,not_removed,gotta make sure whats behind the thing youre shooting at
space,not_removed,space junk killed a few satellites already and it is a selfaccelerating system the longer we wait with cleaning up the more pieces will fly around making it harder to clean up
space,not_removed,space junk isnt a problem strongly disagree it is a huge problem and only getting worse the sls leo coast phase trajectory was chosen to be in large part due to the severe mmod risk at higher altitudes
space,not_removed,damn i thought i had something 😂
space,not_removed,and even the stuff that is metal is mostly nonmagnetic
space,not_removed,i never said it was a good idea p
space,not_removed,shouldnt it be comparably easy to track anything big enough that we wouldnt want to damage it we can shoot missiles despite atmospheric distortions and we can even shoot mosquitoes httpsenwikipediaorgwikimosquitolaser shouldnt it be a lot easier to target objects in space isnt making sure of whats behind the thing youre shooting at httpswwwnasagovmissionpagesstationnewsorbitaldebrishtml
space,not_removed,the russian empiresoviet unionrussian federations great strategic weakness is access to the ocean the long northern coastline is iced over most of the year they have very limited access to the atlantic and only a handful of ports on the pacific and the black sea isnt very big httpsenwikipediaorgwikisovietunionmediafileunionofsovietsocialistrepublicsorthographicprojectionsvg but they did have a vast open steppedesert in what is now kazakhstan so they went for a land landing system their only really good ocean area that is suited for an american style water landing for space flight borders on japanese and us territorial waterso there was a potential for cosmonauts to end up in us water out by alaska the us has vast ranges it controls and leases in both the atlantic and pacific for the atlantic the range goes almost all the way to west africa in fact there were emergecy landing sites at banjul international airport the gambia – dakar senegal and kano nigeria
space,not_removed,ocean landing would be harder for sovietsrussians to recover landing in central asia is a lot easier for them to get to has always been this way as far as i know
space,not_removed,lets ask the other question why did american capsules land in the water the short answer is that because of florida launch site any early capsule eject would end up over the atlantic so the craft had to be designed to handle water landings in case of emergency since the soviets launched over land they had the opposite situation
space,not_removed,supporting water landings is also more expensive and dangerous it took a few ships for each splashdown httphistorynasagovshipshtml
space,not_removed,i think the interesting question here is which landing was a more gentle impact soyuz on land with retro rockets or apollo in water with none
space,not_removed,soyuz landed in a lake by accident made for a hair raising recovery
space,not_removed,just to add to that the soviets have had to selfdestruct several return vehicles along with their nonhuman passengers when there was a probability of them splashing down outside the soviet zone of control
space,not_removed,this land is my land
space,not_removed,what does it look like in just the humanvisible part of the spectrum
space,not_removed,theres also this comet just passing by too but with a period of years so can be seen again
space,not_removed,jay we found water on a planet that cannot create new water lets use it until there is nothing left
space,not_removed,what do you think happens to it when we use it it just disappears water reclamation is the strong point of the space industry
space,not_removed,im down here for my grandmas funeral her husband who passed away in was an engineer on the challenger and so ive always grown up close to nasa were gonna be watching this history and its a great celebration of all my grandparents stood for
space,not_removed,so this is the first time theyre using a reusable stageso this should be a really cheap launch for them
space,not_removed,httpwwwspacexcomwebcast rocket falcon full thrust spacex httpwwwspacexcom i mission is a kg geostationary communications satellite which will replace amc and amc satellites it will provide coverage over mexico central and south americas and the caribbean agencies spacex httpwwwspacexcom national aeronautics and space administration httpwwwnasagov this will also be the first flight of spacexs reusable first stage the rocket originally launched on april my birthday and was recovered via landing on a pad it was refurbished and refueled for a second flight
space,not_removed,thats such a great way to remember him by my condolences
space,not_removed,hope you enjoy it im up north in jacksonville hoping that its visible from here but im afraid its too bright out
space,not_removed,they just made so much money
space,not_removed,were on a boat in the indian its not watching launches from grandmas road but im pretty okay with being this close
space,not_removed,imagine if they had moved forward with nuclear propulsion the advancements wed have today would be amazing
space,not_removed,i didnt see jebediah kerman file a crew report on mars mission failed
space,not_removed,id like to know more original sure for this clipattribution etc
space,not_removed,seems to be a bit early the saturn v didnt get that designation until the and the clip at the end is from an apollo mission looks like apollo
space,not_removed,it sounds like edit after a closer look it seems like its from the httpwwwdaviddarlinginfoencyclopediannervahtml date
space,not_removed,this is not from they show footage from a saturn v launch at the end
space,not_removed,and now i have an idea for how i can get my manned mission to duna to work
space,not_removed,after the humans on board are no longer needed they are jettisoned
space,not_removed,thats disappointing as every ksp player knows you really want to use nuclear propulsion if you plan on doing anything cool beyond dunamars

space,not_removed,funny if we had saturn v we could actually do a mars mission pretty easily their is no need for all nuclear rockets even if they would be nice to have now we have to hope that we can lauch sls per year or maybe try it with falcon heavies that the saturn v was stopped is so incredible sad since then we are sitting in leo and building space stations with tiny little bits
space,not_removed,i wonder if anyone back then would have believed that by we still havent gone to mars
space,not_removed,i grew up in the as a kid i was always upset we did not go nuclear for propulsion
space,not_removed,like going to mars in days
space,not_removed,but then again wed have exploding spaceships and nuclear fallout
space,not_removed,it was so damn promising but no because we cant be mature enough to not put nukes in space our toys get restricted to earth hopefully the future will hold progress allowing this kind of thing to go ahead
space,not_removed,a report on project rover the nerva program
space,not_removed,its budget shrank from million in to only million in million of which was for closeout costs on cancelled contracts spending all your allocated budged on cancelling contracts keeping man on mars always years in the future the edition
space,not_removed,i believe it was a typo as youtube titles and summaries for the video as well google info say the video was
space,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikijimcrowlaws they are clearly different issues but earthly politics dreaming big are not mutually exclusive taking a defeatist stance longing for a past that has been romanticized is the wrong way to go about things
space,not_removed,i dont usually go for political jokes but i just heard this recently jfk put a man on the moon obama put a man in the womens restroom
space,not_removed,ridiculous hogwash the past wasnt utopia buddy while humans were going to the moon the threat of nuclear war loomed vietnam happened as well as the complete shitshow which was denying non white people their rights as human beings need i go on stop romanticising the past at the expense of the present and the future
space,not_removed,what is funny is we could have done more with the saturns if we kept them then what we did with the money we spent on the shuttles funny being really really sad
space,not_removed,stephen baxter writes the apolloares that could have been in his book voyage worth the read if youd like to see how the might have looked
space,not_removed,assuming you dont care about bringing the astronauts back yes realistically were going to need nukes either nuclear thermal rockets like the ones in the op or nuclearpowered ion if you want to make a round trip in a reasonable amount of time say less than years
space,not_removed,im a nuke engineering student now the more i learn the more disappointed i become with the wasted potential of nuclear energy
space,not_removed,the cold war was also responsible for canceling the oroject orion
space,not_removed,in the late it was assumed that after apollo landed on the moon we would start sending manned missions to mars venus and the outer planets as such nasa poured a lot of funding into researching advanced propulsion systems several of these actually got to the full scale test phase before budget cuts and political considerations caused the program to be canceled
space,not_removed,there are certain minor environmental no seriously its actually a drop in the bucket next to existing pollution vectors and major political stumbling blocks to a propulsion system that involves nuclear bombs being detonated every few seconds remember nuclear magnetic resonance imaging had to drop the first word because people were too terrified to use it
space,not_removed,and really thats if you take your sweet time
space,not_removed,well how many apollo missions scattered fuel over earth orbit of one and lets be honest solar orbit is not going to kill us if we irradiate a tiny bit of it
space,not_removed,thanks for this people tend to pine for the good old days but in those times people like me would have been beaten and worse for dating my white girlfriend
space,not_removed,the illuminati space lizards have kept us occupied with trivial human topics because they realized the space program was getting dangerously close to discovering them wake up sheeple
space,not_removed,i dont usually go for political jokes after this post maybe you should stick to the original plan
space,not_removed,really they could have strapped anything to it didnt have to be a spaceplane they just never cared to which is a shame i too would have preferred the saturn v production continue though imagine the avionics upgrades on those things saturn vs flying with in awesome
space,not_removed,that is totally false you can get to mars in month then stay there years and then month back this all works with current propulsion systems you can read up on mars direct edit if if you had nuclear thermal rockets the same architecture should be used you just bring more stuff
space,not_removed,oooooor nuclearpowered em drives
space,not_removed,sound interesting thanks for the tip
space,not_removed,humans are too bloody ignorant
space,not_removed,yeah im a mere biologist but i have always been a big space fan since i was a child
space,not_removed,but but all those ugly radiations and those huuuuge amounts of waste the greens told me that any amount of radiation will increase your cancer by its a risk we cant afford s
space,not_removed,well the un treaty for the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons in space did that my thought always was what a waste we could have been puttputtputting along at but no
space,not_removed,orion was absurd thats why we dont let nasa scientists use lsd anymore
space,not_removed,actually the thing in question is nerva which isnt about detonating nuclear bombs it is about using uranium to heat hydrogen directly and controlled the process with adjustable neutron absorbing coating unlike orion this concept was actively worked on and tested and produced a s isp that would have been the engine for the apollo mars program that was axed mainly because the space race being won so there was lack of incentive and the public was increasingly turning against the space program as a waste of money while favouring social programs a mars program was a way more expensive business than the moon and once apollo was cut there was no point to continue later the public became more and more hostile toward anything nuclear so for any politician it would have been a political suicide
space,not_removed,youre confusing nerva with orion there are no bombs involved here
space,not_removed,days was one estimate for gascore ones
space,not_removed,a collective eye roll for the social justice warrior cluttering up rspace
space,not_removed,or the saturn nerva upper stage that would have been pushing as soon as the
space,not_removed,this all works with current propulsion systems you can read up on mars direct not with saturn vs it doesnt trans mars injection payload for the saturn was approximately tons depending on launch date and transfer orbit the quoted mission weight for mars direct is tons almost times that edit using a nuclear thermal upper stage is what gives you the performance required to do the mission with or launches rather than
space,not_removed,how did nasas test with those go are they still working on them i havent heard anything about that in a while
space,not_removed,ignorant people are given too much attention
space,not_removed,humans decided that they didnt want wide spreads of radioactive isotopes sounds reasoned to me
space,not_removed,id be willing to bet theres a big metal plate under either dia or pantex
space,not_removed,we really should amend that treaty who wants to go into the un
space,not_removed,it worked in httpsenwikipediaorgwikifootfall
space,not_removed,look into the book and you will see different numbers saturn v will do or tonnes depending on how you send it table the missions is designed for exactly that tonnes for the earth return vehicle and tonnes for the hab you send the erv twice for another mission or backup however the exact numbers are not important fact is that we have the technology and we dont need nuclear thermal as i said i would like to see development in ntr but its not required for a mars mission ntr is not an option in the near term anyway even the people working on it dont believe the could do it in the next years their was a talk at mars summit
space,not_removed,nasas tests saw thrust from em drives and cannae drives httpsenwikipediaorgwikirfresonantcavitythrustertestingandreplicationclaims id very much like to see a test article in space once they have the actual mechanics of it all worked out
space,not_removed,its not the ignorant ones but the stupid ones that get our attention
space,not_removed,the problem is that the perception of danger is weighs more in peoples mind than the level of danger radioactive isotopes are a danger yes but they are released by tonnes to the air by every coal plant yet very few people at time were against it at the time even today while the greenhouse emission is a concern to a lot of people few are concerned by the level of radioactive traces released nuclear has a bad reputation mainly because of the potential danger it poses not the actual danger that and a half a century of nuclear arms race fear also amplified by the score of pulp fiction and other media that depicted nuclear technology in apocalyptic and dystopia for the last few decades dont misunderstand me being cocky about it as some were in the and is also insane but we are on the other side of the swing too long nerva has proven to be the most effective rocket engine in history we can produce larger isp but only with forbidding mass penalty that limits nuclear propulsion is the next step in space exploration fearing nuclear basically locked us into leo
space,not_removed,your command of english doesnt sound reasoned to me
space,not_removed,check out winchell chungs page on httpwwwprojectrhocompublichtmlrocketindexphp for some fun reading a comment there or somewhere similar inspired me to read nivenpournelles novel footfall where spoiler alert you have a project orion style ship used as a launch vehicle yes its bad for the city its in the books quite the page turner like their other big screen disaster book lucifers hammer
space,not_removed,why does it lock us into leo we know how the get out with chemical rockets nuclear would be nice but the claim that we need them to get out of leo is false
space,not_removed,ill check out that page ive read both of those and a lot of material on orion and plowshare i will virtually guarantee there is is a built orion somewhere in the united states waiting only for fissionable material that material is sitting in pantex something would have been done with it otherwise if there was not an ultimate destination for it
space,not_removed,i drove through bellingham last week and was thinking of that book great solution to the problem they had but rough on the pnw
space,not_removed,project orion style ship used as a launch vehicle also in poul andersons orion shall rise which is at least silolaunched from a remote area
space,not_removed,the launch vehicle orion was actually considered and calculated to cause about as much fallout as the average nuclear weapon test of the time
space,not_removed,while it is possible to escape leo with chemical rockets it is an issue of economics for a spacecraft double the effective specific impulse mean that half of the propellant takes you to the same delta v the mass penalty is exponential to launch half as much mass means less than half of the amount of propellant and so on this means that the whole launch stack can be done much cheaper chemical first stage is not going anywhere anytime soon because the size of the vehicle poses a lot of technical challenges handling vibrations structural solidity balancing etc all gets super complicated as you increase the launch mass mars while on low energy trajectory is the same delta v as the moon and dont forget just how monstrous launch vehicle was needed for it the travel time is not sustainable for humans you have to carry around so much supplies that it cuts into any long term plan while you can build on a multiple launches strategy it would still end up prohibitively expensive thats i believe is the reason why we dont go for any infrastructural project in space
space,not_removed,even if you have nuclear rockets you would use the same travel time because its simply the most effective way to send cargo to mars you would simply increase the amount of equipment needed if you have a more powerful rocket even if we do make the huge investment for development of ntr for the time being they would have to be the upper stage of a saturn v like vehicle and you still need to develop a big rocket that needs to be reusable i would argue a reusable rocket is the more important then ntr cheap ntr would be nice to have but their is absolutely no prove that they can be manufactured in a cost competitive way all your arguments are simple it would be nice because in theory they are good that is true but we have done space travel for a long time without them and we will have to live without them for the next years at least in that time we could travel to mars with chemical rockets
space,not_removed,even if you have nuclear rockets you would use the same travel time because its simply the most effective way to send cargo to mars you would simply increase the amount of equipment needed if you have a more powerful rocket its a matter of choice depending on what you send to mars if you send cargo yes low energy trajectory might be the better choice because you can pack cargo that lasts if you pack humans its different its a tradeoff for the lifesupport size and effectiveness thus mass and bulk penalties calculated and travel time exposure to zerog and radiation the potential of cme etc with chemical rockets we dont really have a choice humans have to be sent on low delta v trajectories which in turn means a large mass of life support supplies radiation sheltering etc lots of lots of mass ntr takes the square root of that mass ratio even if you go with the lowest deltav budget ntr makes enormous difference and imho it would actually enable such travel which we simply cannot afford without it my point is that the economics of space travel today cant really allow us to leave the cislunar space and perhaps even the option for lunar travel is severely limited with chemical rockets we can send probes spacecraft of a couple tonnes for the time being they would have to be the upper stage of a saturn v like vehicle i disagree ntr or not saturn vclass launchers are simply too expensive too risky even if we stick to chemical rockets our best chance is to use orbital assembly for larger spacecraft ntr could only lend itself to large spacecraft design thats true but i dont see the point of launching such large spacecraft in one go as i said chemical rockets have very little competition for launch vehicles but from leogeo nuclear rockets can unlock space infrastructure what chemical rockets just failed to do so far my optimism about nerva though i see the points where it might turn out to be failure is fairly grounded in the fact that there were working prototypes producing twice as much isp as our lhlox engines chemical rocket engines had a century to be developed pretty much freely since the world war so it isnt unwarranted to think that investing into ntr propulsion could easily yield some improvement on effectiveness of the design in that time we could travel to mars with chemical rockets i dont see this happening the plans so far put forward are either the kind of flagandfootprint kind of missions that wont hold in the current political climate even if they are technically feasible too expensive for what nationalism could fuel for spending or they are outright ridiculous sending probes to mars currently is difficult enough look at how complicated it was to land a less than one tonne rover on the surface let alone lending life support systems and people with some chances of survival
space,not_removed,why should we spend all this energy to make the travel time smaller it would make much more sense to send more stuff were working prototypes true but we have no idea how much the production and launch cost would be so it isnt unwarranted to think that investing into ntr propulsion could easily yield some improvement on effectiveness of the design again i agree with this im just saying that we can get it in near term i dont see this happening the plans so far put forward are either the kind of flagandfootprint kind of missions that wont hold in the current political climate even if they are technically feasible too expensive for what nationalism could fuel for spending or they are outright ridiculous well currently nothing is really happening so its a mute point the reason i want a simple mars direct mission is because it has a cost that is manageable with current budget all those other ideas that combine in orbit assembly tugs and all kinds of other stuff are total nonstarters with current budgets if the nasa wants to go to mars with its current budget a mars direct style plan is the only viable one
space,not_removed,why should we spend all this energy to make the travel time smaller it would make much more sense to send more stuff in case you missed it i wrote about it for humans travel time matters because we are actively eat shit and breath the more watertight you want to make a recycling system the bulkier and heavier its going to be radiation and cmes also point of concern the longer you are exposed to radiation the heavier shielding is recommended but that also adds to the mass so in many ways buy going slower you are wasting away the extra mass you could get anyway by going faster at least you get well getting there faster
space,not_removed,its kind of hard to argue against you because i dont know what plan that you are arguing for from everything i have seen so far this calculation simply does not add up the supply you need to take for a longer journey easily fit in the gained overall power of the rocket the energy it takes to get there in a shorter time is a way bigger deal you can significantly increase the amount of scientific payload if you had ntr that is far more important then reducing radiation to the crew solar radiation its not really a huge problem you need the food and water anyways if crew safety is your concern then you much rather use the more powerful rocket to send along bigger margins of foodwater and other supplies their are many ways how a more powerful rocket can improve crew safety reducing travel time is the least important another huge aspect is the free return that you get with the month mission so far as i know most other architectures dont have that feature so sacrificing this just so you can reduce radiation is a horrible tradeoff from a crew perspective if you have a full plan with calculations that show that im wrong please send it to me
space,not_removed,not questioning op but its way too early to tell if thats the case just because the is an affect dosnt mean sotinhg caused it could be dangerous chemicals involved in testing or odd types of insulation could be other many other reasonsi thinks is alarmist and dangerous to the idea of a mars mission because people get spooked i do think much more testing and investigation is need instead of see the answer is and saying
space,not_removed,cant help w spacex but can attest that the level tour is awesome worth every penny the tour will include all the big attractions and more taking up most of the day mine started at and we got done around or so just enough time left over to walk around and do a little exploring and swing by the gift shop
space,not_removed,when at the nbl if you see a diver named wes keep winking hell know what to do
space,not_removed,everyone knows that nasa does not use real images
space,not_removed,if there was extra risk the insurance would be greater and it isnt they do get a discount for this flight though
space,not_removed,the hole reason to use used rockets is to get the launch price down the first launch with a used rocket maybe cost even less because its the first time
space,not_removed,if there was extra risk the insurance would be greater and it isnt as if actuaries at insurance companies know more about the engineering and physics of rocket reuse than rocket engineers do the insurance companies are pretty much taking spacex at their word at this point if the first reuse ends in failure even if that failure is found to not be related to reuse then you can safely bet that the price to insure payloads launched on reused rockets will go up thats just the way insurance risk management works i mean it is a good sign that insurance prices have not yet gone up for flights on reused rockets but its not the best indicator for safety because theres no way that the people who set insurance company policy are more informed than the company that builds the rockets it works with cars and terrestrial shipping because there is enough data for insurance companies to manage their risk there have been billions of successful shipping contracts and thousand of models of cars insurance companies know what they are dealing with when a new shipping contract comes along and they know what things make cars safe and what makes them dangerous not so much for reused rockets
space,not_removed,it could be quite literally anything in the universe but we always seem to immediately jump to extraterrestrials
space,not_removed,at what speed does a radio signal travel through space if the origin of the signal is light years away im guessing it was long long ago that this signal began its journey
space,not_removed,odds are that someday it will be etsomeday
space,not_removed,speed of light so the signal has taken years to get to us
space,not_removed,yup and they are not responding to us as we have not been transmitting long enough
space,not_removed,its like one of those relationships where you get made at each other and dont communicate for light years
space,not_removed,if so how was it as simple as they used less powerful middle stages or is it more complex it was actually simpler the skylab was a third stage with equipment in place of fuel and engines it dated back to when the skylab was supposed to be launched on the smaller saturn i where the sivb acted as the second stage and in order to get into orbit it would have to actually be used as a rocket stage and then the station would be set up in the empty tanks a wet workshop fyi an upgraded saturn iv with a wet workshop siv was supposed to be used in a venus flyby mission
space,not_removed,liquidpropellant rocket engines can be throttled and shut down nearly at will you burn them for as long as you need to achieve desired speed and orbit
space,not_removed,the saturn v had a payload of to leo and to tli skylab weighed and the saturn v had the third stage removed which was actually part of its payload to leo skylab also orbited at a higher altitude than the orbit the saturn v could put into roughly as opposed to roughly
space,not_removed,no need to reduce thrust just burn for shorter amount of time thrust is actually reduced at some point when most of the fuel is spent and the rocket is light enough for the acceleration to be too large for the payload to handle usually kept at gs for most launches
space,not_removed,whats even more amazing is that due to the meteorite shield being ripped of skylab tumbling down the rocket the interstage ring was damaged and did not separate properly from the stage though engineers were sure this would cause the stage to fail from overheating but it nonetheless made it to orbit thus saturn v managed to place an entire sii the stage connector ring stage adapter and skylab workshop itself into leo in one go
space,not_removed,so you are saying that since people in the future are going to forget the stories weve been telling each other for the last several thousand years we should come up with constellations based on the stories that theyll be telling in the future
space,not_removed,there are nearly stars visible to the unaided eye on a clear moonless night under ideal conditions with good vision there are only about known exoplanets and many most of those orbit stars that arent even visible to the unaided eye
space,not_removed,no the constellation represents math distances from point a to b instead of magical ponies
space,not_removed,theres about stars visible to the naked eye where i am there are zero computer programs on the naked sky naked sky observation isnt the goal or destination im not planning a million year trip for my sail boat
space,not_removed,thats not what constellations are used for at all that doesnt even make any sense stay in school try to learn something
space,not_removed,dude what the shit are you talking about
space,not_removed,go to an area that doesnt have light pollution wwwlightpollutionmapinfo there are much more stars visible from earth than you think
space,not_removed,that is a pointless endevour because no planetary systems outside our solar system are visible to the naked eye and there is no way of telling the distance from object a to object b in the plain night sky mankind stared at the night sky for over years before an exoplanet was discovered thats trips to an area without light pollution multiplied by untold millions of eyeballs that still couldnt and wouldnt ever see an exoplanet
space,not_removed,i will miss cassini what an interesting mission hope we will see some more great pictures when its mission ends later this year and crashes into saturn
space,not_removed,i enjoyed that and would certainly like to see the next one about the juno mission
space,not_removed,if those are moons then its most likely jupiter and those are the galilean moons
space,not_removed,thats exactly what jupiter looks like through my camera going with jupiter
space,not_removed,as far as i know venus has been the only planet easily visible lately but i could be largely mistaken
space,not_removed,im fairly certain jupiter is correct
space,not_removed,theyre not whales on jupiter if you actually read past the first couple of words in the only paragraph there youd know that it was talking about transmitting whale sounds from the ocean around hawaii so absolutely nothing to do with jupiter
space,not_removed,what do you guys think about this do you think this is legit
space,not_removed,same reason as to why we do things like fight over religion theres no way to get everyone to agree with eachother and nobody is willing to try because it is so unlikely that things will actually progress without disagreements
space,not_removed,just because you stop being militant doesnt mean everyone else does even neglecting the subset of people who believe that space doesnt exist which has a significant overlap with the people who consider you a filthy kuffar and would happily slaughter you in the name of allah there is a lot to be gained through violence and conquest for the people who excel at it theres a chance to gain a lot more than peaceful cooperation can ever provide them have you heard of the prisoners dilemma if you dont know whether the other side wants to betray you the winning strategy is to betray them furthermore there is absolutely no economic benefit in exploring or colonizing space lots of expenses no gains
space,not_removed,your optimism is pathetically naive when was the last time exploration ended in civil peace
space,not_removed,because that is our nature pick literally anything and people will form opposing opinions about it thats what we do
space,not_removed,how exactly do you propose we conquer space and what do we do when we get there space is empty theres nowhere to live breathe eat or grow other than earth
space,not_removed,absolutely necessary theres little difference between gmo and crossbreeding anyway
space,not_removed,generally speaking yes off world agriculture will go better if the plants are genetically tailored for their environment as much as possible but since no plant on earth has evolved to survive on mars we dont have a lot of genes to work with research is being done now to find varieties of plants that survive best in low light and nutrient poor situations which should get us started
space,not_removed,would it be possible to create a mars like environment in a lab stick a bacteria culture in it as well as some initial resources for it to be able to reproduce enough generations and evolve to sustain itself using martian conditions and resources cause that always survives and bacteria reproduce fast
space,not_removed,it will have to be modified but modifying it to survive in the current mars environment is likely impossible in general gmo is just a mixing or switching of existing genes youd likely need entirely new and different genes to have an organism survive a completely different planet
space,not_removed,wow can you tell us a little more about this mission what a spectacular picture
space,not_removed,also it is not the best of ideas to place httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprojectwestford
space,not_removed,they may be all on the table but theres no percentage in doing it nobody is going to pay for it because everybody is going to say someone else isnt doing their fair share
space,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiplanetes
space,not_removed,none of that shit would work because you have to match the orbit of the debris otherwise its just going to punch a hole in your sail and these objects are in all kinds of orbits the best idea ive heard is to hit them with a laser hard enough to either vaporize them or scrub their velocity enough so they deorbit
space,not_removed,i wonder if we could park a sizable asteroid or maybe a dozen into an orbit and cover it with aerogel or something else to absorb impact energy with no debris just let the minuscule gravity suck up all the bits perhaps throw on some thrusters to change orbit when the path is cleared
space,not_removed,we should either laser the biggest offenders or put a huge magnet to gather them all in one place
space,not_removed,maybe step one need to be to stop polluting our orbit then start cleaning up but since private corporations seem to be the future of space exploration they will need to be such an expense to their bottom line that it is worth doing
space,not_removed,the larger the number of participants the more difficult it is true at the same time though we are making slow progress on at least some global issues and this is not so dissimilar from the rest probably a crazy idea but if someone could collect rather than destroy this debris a lot of it would be valuable to collectors too and thus have a monetary incentive attached
space,not_removed,the best idea ive heard is to hit them with a laser hard enough to either vaporize them or scrub their velocity enough so they deorbit the practical version of nuke it from the ground its the only way to be sure more seriously where and how powerful should that laser be so that you could actually aim at and vaporize things in orbit
space,not_removed,itd have to be enormous for the gravity to do anything
space,not_removed,most debris is not magnetic
space,not_removed,for sure right now the esa is the only org actually set to launch a cleanup project but with more private participants there is going to have to be distributed responsibility it is the same problem on the planet really corporations trash stuff and government is too often left cleaning it up
space,not_removed,im sure no private company has foreseen getting hit by a piece of their own debris and losing a multimillion dollar payload news flash they all take steps to minimize orbital debris because it is in their best interests
space,not_removed,it depends on the size of the object boeing developed a laser that could take out incoming ballistic missiles that was a megawatt laser and relied on a chemical generator to put out that much power boeing has a two killowatt system for taking out drones that just burns holes in them the navy has kw laser deployed now that is for disabling small targets im sure the kw system could vaporize most small orbital debris just by heating the object up enough on one side you could create a vapor emmission that would act like rocket thrust and if directed the right way deorbit the object the problem is focusing from hundreds of kilometers away on a small object moving in a different orbit that is moving at meters per second not so easy
space,not_removed,ya with our money i now realize step one needs to be finding a way to control overly powerful corporate entities
space,not_removed,that or we all end up belters in the expanse
space,not_removed,interesting note any spacecraft thats managed to maintain a stable orbit would likely still be in almost pristine condition with the exception of needing a new power source id be surprised if a company didnt spring up at some point in the future with the express purpose of renovating existing satellites installing new or upgrading existing components as needed in reality this is the most efficient route to maintaining a connected planet without running the risk of creating debris clouds in orbit granted this wont be a truly serious problem for a while though it is starting to become one now it will be something that somebody will need to handle
space,not_removed,i disagree with the pristine earthclose space is full of agressive ionic bombardment many experiments prove it looks for space shuttles ldef mission basically over the time sputtering will kill external protections making the spacecraft vulnerable to the big changes in temperatures electronic is going to be damaged due to radiations too we shall never think that because space is vacuum nothing happens thats wrong especially in earths vicinity but still would me kinda cool to recover old spacecrafts for scientific purpose and for some emotional reasons maybe
space,not_removed,while space is aggressive its also worth mentioning that only certain parts of any given orbital craft is really affected by things like radiation and temperature fluctuations for example the structural integrity of most satellites will remain sound until the craft itself burns up if it never finds a stable orbit certain basic components such as wiring may be affected by radiation but thats a matter of simply having better signalversusnoise detection in any updated hardware which leads to updated hardware it would due to new manufacturing standards methods and materials likely include inlineintegrated radiation and thermal shielding really older craft that could be refurbished would likely simply act as orbital carriers for better virtually selfcontained units that would simply be relying on the craft for its structure and some hardware such as again power integration
space,not_removed,what would be interesting is to determine what would be the limit where a spacecraft is unusable like a rusted car can be used a while if there is still enough untouched steel making it structurally safe i wonder how long a satellite can endure atomic oxygen exposure before falling apart
space,not_removed,most of those posts should already be removed on the ground that they are rehosted contents report them so that the mods can see them
space,not_removed,if you have a cardboard viewer try this out i made it out of fascination for the apollo missions apollo the first mission with the rover being the obvious choice for a demo on cardboard the app is totally free and even if youve never tried vr before you should still be able to follow let me know what you think
space,not_removed,congratulations spacex glad to witness this live cant wait for the video great job
space,not_removed,unfortunately the video cut out in the live feed so no seamless video of the landing this time
space,not_removed,huzzah looking forward to ten years from now well have space ports like we have bus stops
space,not_removed,this post has a bad title that doesnt convey what happened
space,not_removed,unfortunately the video cut our in the live feed so no seamless video of the landing this time the quality of the live feed was never good all the great videos were from onboard cameras who have been retrieved later
space,not_removed,the data link cut out but the video should still be posted later
space,not_removed,yeah i can see myself telling my kid at one of these ports that i witnessed the first landing of a already used stage and the kid is either gonna be blown out of his mind or he is gonna be bored with all the embarrassing stuff i am talking about
space,not_removed,i am bit sad they didnt land near the landing pad that landing was so smooth
space,not_removed,itll be very much like today i reckon parent i remember when we didnt have enter device of choice and we had to write letters or play thumb wars to pass the time kid face buried in device of choice in any case itll always be a point of wonder for me humans are flightless yet well be going into space all willy nilly thanks to sheer intelligence thats the point ill be trying to get across to my future kiddos 👨🏾‍🚀
space,not_removed,the pad landings are much easier with an iss launch because of the trajectory and weight of the rocket more fuel left to return and a shorter return this one not so much still dang cool though
space,not_removed,yeah i think so too the fact we can build something like that automate it because we couldnt steer it effeciently enough to the point it returns without crashing is amazing i want to pull this on my kids
space,not_removed,yeah i thought so much the trajectory was wide on the simulation they showed afterwards but was it always that meco happend after i thought it took them a bit longer with the first stage
space,not_removed,oh dude thats a great comic fits exactly how i feel about this
space,not_removed,nasa oh did we say it was gonna hit us april fools d
space,not_removed,how do i go about finding out what time and where i need to look to see it im in florida currently
space,not_removed,google is you best bet if you dont fancy watching the live stream
space,not_removed,my biggest curiosity is what type of research spacex is doing to protect humans on the way there radiation on the trip over is something nasa currently doesnt know how to deal with fully and its one of the reasons why theyre deliberately moving slower than spacex having a colony wont be sustainable if a significant percentage of your colonists end up getting horrific cancers a few years after you get there the other big factor is space per person i understand the mct is big but spacex is claiming that they can fit people on this shuttle how much room is allotted per person and how will that affect their psychological wellbeing on the way there youre talking about a journey of months with no personal space fresh air or fresh food and that could cause real problems people become irate on hour flights how are they going to deal with people going crazy because they cant handle the trip how are they going to bring enough water and food for people for months again this is a challenge for nasa trying to figure out how to get enough food for just a few astronauts and were talking orders of magnitude more and the biggest question is how are they going to land the very thin atmosphere on mars has so far been a huge challenge in landing vehicles mars has just enough atmosphere to cause serious drag issues and risks of burning up but it doesnt have enough of an atmosphere to properly slow down so you get the worst of all possible scenarios its one of the reasons the skycrane had to be invented and currently nasa has no known method of landing anything heavier than the curiosity rover and elon is talking about landing something as large as a passenger plane on the surface full of people and cargo and finally how are they going to shield themselves from radiation and hazards on the surface mars dust is toxic and has razor sharp micro particles that not only will destroy equipment but can burn and shred lungs eyes and skin there is a reason nasa is moving so slowly and trying to address these problems instead of just charging headlong into it i am a huge spacex fan and adamantly procolonizing mars but i am hugely skeptical of some of the claims that elon has made about how theyre going to do it
space,not_removed,one of the proposals for mars bases is to build them underground or cover them with mars regolith forget the correct term used to describe it elon pitched generating their own magnetic field to shield the base but i cant believe that would be possible let alone feasible in the next years
space,not_removed,my biggest curiosity is what type of research spacex is doing to protect humans on the way there radiation on the trip over is something nasa currently doesnt know how to deal with fully and its one of the reasons why theyre deliberately moving slower than spacex having a colony wont be sustainable if a significant percentage of your colonists end up getting horrific cancers a few years after you get there none that ive heard of keeping the propulsion section between themselves and the sun is their solution and according to a purdue guy in another thread doing actual research on mars flight shielding this is nowhere near enough the other big factor is space per person i understand the mct is big but spacex is claiming that they can fit people on this shuttle how much room is allotted per person and how will that affect their psychological wellbeing on the way there youre talking about a journey of months with no personal space fresh air or fresh food and that could cause real problems enough for a firstclass restaurant apparently and the biggest question is how are they going to land the very thin atmosphere on mars has so far been a huge challenge in landing vehicles mars has just enough atmosphere to cause serious drag issues and risks of burning up but it doesnt have enough of an atmosphere to properly slow down so you get the worst of all possible scenarios its one of the reasons the skycrane had to be invented and currently nasa has no known method of landing anything heavier than the curiosity rover and elon is talking about landing something as large as a passenger plane on the surface full of people and cargo supersonic retropropulsion which will be tested by red dragon on a very small scale although i see an instant vulnerability of ict in this regard its engines arent angled firing the motor directly along the retrograde actually reduces drag
space,not_removed,im so tired of hearing people whine about radiation msl curiosity had an instrument that measured radiation on the way to mars and nasas design reference mars mission posits various cruise durations with a typical figure of about days the msls cruise was longer than this but with a human crew aboard it is likely that faster transits would be selected assuming a oneway duration similar shielding and a similar time in the solar cycle we would expect a crew to receive msv from gcrs with additional variable contributions from sep events the return trip would double this to msv in total msv for days in transit to and from mars spacex is doing the trip in as little as days which cuts that number in half to msv which translates to httpwwwxrayriskcomcalculatorcalculatornormalstudiesphp from a baseline of chance to chance i think thats tolerable
space,not_removed,i think its just existence the universe and nonexistence the voidoutside the universe
space,not_removed,theres several theories out there between the idea of multiverses to branching timelines and converging universes combining together
space,not_removed,when i was a kid the universe as far as i knew was everything it all seemed easier to understand
space,not_removed,keep in mind and im a layman but what exists now isnt the known universe its the observable universe were also under the assumption that the universe is isotropic which it may not be could be in time the big bang is just a small explosion somewhere in the unobserved universe and its happening all over that universe big explosionsimplosions and everything in between them is just debrisleftovers from the edges
space,not_removed,your question isnt well defined first you need to decide what you mean by outside and what you define as the universe if youre talking about all of time and space that exists and probably exists outside of our observable universe then no there is no outside ad we would normally thing about it outside the universe is necessarily not time or space so its probably not something we can really understand or know its not even a void you need space to have a void
space,not_removed,there has to be life over millions of planets and were the only lucky ones to be alone ya ok
space,not_removed,hehe i swear i have stalkers guy asks for my theory i give my theory i get downvoted
space,not_removed,so the universe could just be one in what i call a super universe that could be spread out so far that light cant reach far enough to observe these other universes
space,not_removed,check out michio kaku on youtube his theory is that its not a universe but a multiverse out there parallel universes that exist on different planes slightly above each other how we get to see them is tbd
space,not_removed,its important to take kaku with a grain of salt though
space,not_removed,i would totally be that guy that would say good morning times a day
space,not_removed,i also will have this on my wall and if anyone needs it in tiff edges cropped slightly saturated in cmyk and enlarged to × cm dpi mb thank you commander jeff williams edit also a mb which will fit onto a sheet
space,not_removed,they have morning times a day starting to realize why there isnt a whole lot of video with the space station as the static reference with the earth spinning around under it at the same time it would be dizzying the link to a iss video starts with a small segment of the earth going by underneath the iss and it shows what going around the earth in an hour and a half is like on the iss if you arent looking down at the earth it feels like it is totally still httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbhgydridbea
space,not_removed,amazing stuff things like the iss make you appreciate how amazing humans are and makes you realise that we take it for advantage every day without stepping back and being really thankful for what we have
space,not_removed,metadata for the pic if anybody here was curious
space,not_removed,this is an awesome monitor wallpaper one of the few that i have found that look nice
space,not_removed,this makes me wonder is the ocean super reflective of the sun does it created a super bright reflection when observed from the iss or anywhere else out there really
space,not_removed,the wifi signal up there is either fucking terrible or absolutely amazing
space,not_removed,just curious when was the earth last photographed as a whole i know that httpsolarviewscomrawearthearthafrjpg is the most iconic but it was taken decades ago
space,not_removed,can someone explain the vapor trail looking clouds yes that is a legitimately serious scientificmeteorological question
space,not_removed,the most amusing part of threads like these are scrolling down trying to find the flat earther im sure we will see several where is the curve comments and these images are fake cgi it helps me to appreciate such interstellar beauty even more to remind me of how stupid some of the inhabitants of this blue sphere actually are
space,not_removed,reading that started me on a learning quest where i found out that all soyuz meaning union spacecraft the only way to or from the iss always take off and land land in kazakstan im sure thats pretty common knowledge for many people here but its new to me its been that way since it was part of the ussr and utilized because of low population density and vast open plains reducing civilian risk in the case of catastrophe and providing good reception for radio and the guys who retrieve the space fellows know the territory well and have always tracked the pod down efficiently so if it aint broke dont fix it i guess
space,not_removed,i swear there was a video about a year or two ago of the astronauts on the iss watching the sun rise over the earth and listening to tool i think the song was lateralus but i cant find the video anywhere

space,not_removed,yea nice view but i hear the weather is terrible this time of year you cant even go outside without being fully covered
space,not_removed,this was nasas image of the day yesterday i think i know because i set up ifttt to email me nasas image of the day
space,not_removed,so cool！a real picture from space！have you ever seen the picture of wechat？that picture is like this，but i think thats not real
space,not_removed,when you return home are you ever nervous to tell passport control you work for iss
space,not_removed,what a time to be alive i love always been interested in space stuff and so much space stuff going on right now life is glorious
space,not_removed,goodmorning i think there is no night or dark when you are at space station
space,not_removed,lol hilarious keep shoving it down our throats nasa we get it we believe everything you show us even though the imaginary curve is a little off on the left side maybe they need a better photoshop guy
space,not_removed,i know many people will say eventually it eventually turns into every other view at work but honestly i dont think id get of it either
space,not_removed,well in the iss the sun risessets every minutes so you could say it times an earth day
space,not_removed,good way to end up in the airlock grumblegrumblemorningpeoplegrumblegrumble
space,not_removed,id feel required to play louis armstrongs what a wonderful world every morning
space,not_removed,me too its my favourite part of the day
space,not_removed,hey great images but i noticed the sun was missing from these so i went ahead and fixed that enjoy
space,not_removed,i have two monitors at work going to take that large photo cut it into two and have the panorama span across both monitors yeee
space,not_removed,thank you i can see this hanging in my loft ill split it into images print it on canvas no frame and hang them with an inch or two in between now to decide if this goes against the black wall or the brick
space,not_removed,do we know what camera and lens they used
space,not_removed,which service even accepts images to print into germany preferably
space,not_removed,i saved this comment but it wont let me view it maybe cause im on my phone ill try again later i want to get it printed whats a good big panoramic size you recommend for this picture
space,not_removed,thanks for the tiff do you have an idea what print media would be best for this ie type of paper canvas metal etc
space,not_removed,do you have a jpg or png that is not so big i just want it as wallpaper
space,not_removed,you know a pictures good quality when making it your wallpaper takes two minutes

space,not_removed,search for the live feeds in hd from nasa you can set them up as screensaver and watch your own sunrise
space,not_removed,they dont have wifi they use satellites up in geosynchronous orbit to get data from earth
space,not_removed,dscovr is still actively photographing the earth from a lagrange point if you want a year on earth taken from this vantage point here is
space,not_removed,ten minutes ago at most the is a japanese satellite that takes a picture of the whole disc every minutes
space,not_removed,the discovr satellite takes multiple images of the whole earth every day
space,not_removed,dscovr also took this movie of the moon and
space,not_removed,they launch from the same pad as yuri gagarin later
space,not_removed,this isnt actually posted by an astronaut
space,not_removed,because of reflection you only see the light which is being reflected directly towards you not the light which is passing you left and right if you move that hotspot will move with you
space,not_removed,because the sun isnt that far away literally would be impossible to have a sun spot from m miles away theres a reason they show us this shit every single day weve all been trained to believe their story theyre just reassuring us its real
space,not_removed,there is still sunrise and sunset so thats what they base night and day off of at the iss even though its not technically correct
space,not_removed,i have to ask what are you trying to say it looks as if you are missing some words in your sentence
space,not_removed,this is spectacular i fn love this planet best footage ive seen from the iss hands down
space,not_removed,i used to be a durabilitydriver for prototype dirt bikes i was paid to ride motorcycles as hard as i felt comfortable with i had access to a field with a large track to go as fast as i wanted and dirt mounds for jumping im pretty sure after months youll get tired of any job
space,not_removed,i dont know about you but there was only a couple windows at work and i had no problem standing at them and staring outside for at least minutes every other day even after a year i didnt get tired of it
space,not_removed,well ya gotta sleep for a part of that
space,not_removed,i fixed the sun for ya
space,not_removed,the sun needs sun glasses obviously
space,not_removed,care to share it if you get it done im also interested as using it for my dual monitors
space,not_removed,thats a neat idea i think definitely the black wall
space,not_removed,how do you plan on doing that i want to know so i can do the exact same shit haha
space,not_removed,we do jeff used a nikon with a sigma lens set to about he took a series of images to create this panorama through
space,not_removed,every print firm just email them
space,not_removed,unfortunately i only work with graphics for a living and im not an expert on printing material but any local printer near you should have solid suggestions
space,not_removed,sure thing is okay
space,not_removed,how about tax papers tan pants country dish towels
space,not_removed,the moon landing was fake we live under a dome yada yada yada wake up sheeple s
space,not_removed,flash mode no flash not that they havent tried at least once
space,not_removed,but can they get on reddit
space,not_removed,literally would be impossible to have a sun spot from m miles away you seem very convinced why do you say its impossible when i can literally see this myself while im watching a sunrise or sunset from across a big body of water do you understand reflection
space,not_removed,nasa has a live stream from the iss i have it set to my screensaver
space,not_removed,you got tired of that after months
space,not_removed,i stare out a window all of my math class ive been in the same classroom for two years and the view of the pine trees never gets old no i havent failed my math class my math teacher just teaches multiple classes
space,not_removed,please edit this to where the black around that sun matches the background and i will definitely make that my dual screen monitor wallpaper
space,not_removed,and a hat the sun hasnt got his hat on
space,not_removed,it worked really well im redditdumb how do i share the finished picture with you
space,not_removed,god damn that looks good too bad i have beige walls
space,not_removed,bush still did right
space,not_removed,not falling for it you lizard
space,not_removed,flat earthers are like chuck norris they dont argue with anyone they just underline all the facts cause they already know everything no need to discuss something with someone who knows the truth
space,not_removed,thank you its now my screensaver was going to ask you how to do that but then i asked google who ultimately got me back to reddit but yeah thanks
space,not_removed,unfortunately yes after riding dirt bikes hours a day for three months i got burned out on riding dirt bikes it also made me realize the main thing that makes something fun is its novelty the more exposure i have to something the less novel it is its like im writing a program in my brain that uses a model of my environment and when new things stop happening then i dont need to program anything and then i just let the program autopilot my body while i think of something else ive found everyone does this its why the person at the register can get robbed at gunpoint while the customers and other employees are completely unaware its also why married people often stop interacting with each other if everyone is on autopilot and they dont have robbery in their program then they may not even see it if spouses are on autopilot in their marriage they may not even notice the things that are novel
space,not_removed,im no photoshop wizard but here you go
space,not_removed,go to imgurcom upload the pictures there and then it will give you a link that you can share with others
space,not_removed,yeah i got it from the tutorial on reddit too it works like a charm
space,not_removed,thought it might be something along those lines i dont have an imgur account suppose it about time to create one
space,not_removed,you dont actually require an account to upload you should just be able to make an upload from the home screen
space,not_removed,yes rising ocean levels will eventually cause issues that will need to be mediated somehow
space,not_removed,by the time they are underwater probably end of this century the era of space exploration will be long over
space,not_removed,as long as the optic nerve isnt damaged i would take the tradeoff being far sighted as a result of being in spaaaace im okay with this but this is assuming thats all that happens truth is theres also dna damage bone density loss muscle density loss still okay with it spaaaaace
space,not_removed,image credit nasa jplcaltech swri msss processing roman tkachenko explanation this storm cloud on jupiter is almost as large as the earth known as a white oval the swirling cloud is a high pressure system equivalent to an earthly anticyclone the cloud is one of a string of pearls ovals south of jupiters famous great red spot possibly the great red spot is just a really large white oval than turned red surrounding clouds show interesting turbulence as they flow around and past the oval the featured image was captured on february as nasas robotic spacecraft juno made a new pass just above the cloud tops of the jovian world over the next few years juno will continue to orbit and probe jupiter determine atmospheric water abundance and attempt to determine if jupiter has a solid surface beneath its thick clouds
space,not_removed,i wonder if this was at closest approach its pretty grainy and lores
space,not_removed,this is awesome some might think this isnt glamorous but this is the nitty gritty that a spacefaring civilization like i dream we will be would depend on i imagine its similar to how we depend on garbage companies the roads that the trucks drive on etc you just gotta have free and clear orbits before you think about regular travel to moon bases and mars colonies
space,not_removed,could someone explain the positives of these other than having more space is there anything that can be done in these but not in the normal living quarters
space,not_removed,they are cheaper to put in orbit and supposedly a little safer for the occupants
space,not_removed,thanks for the reply ive looked at it myself i probably should have done that before i asked but i didnt know about the safer part
space,not_removed,did you watch mars episode this is the backstory of one of the characters it was quite good a fictiondocumentary combination as a spacex fan and general space enthusiast it was one of my favorite shows in a while and i love this short story
space,not_removed,same issue that afflicts discovery tlc and history channel the urge to create viewergrabbing content eventually overrides producing good educational television
space,not_removed,yeah im definitely looking forward to the next episodes unfortunately i think the premier on the is the episode we already watched got a while to wait
space,not_removed,i can just see the gravity being so low that it just punts off into space power how many times can they do that selfrighting manoeuvre before the power runs out
space,not_removed,hi can someone explain the last bit of the video to me the one with the hard impact
space,not_removed,it had solar panels on all sides so even if its not up it can still charge
space,not_removed,has anyone got a source everything im reading from esa kind of refers to a singular panel
space,not_removed,likely a single panel capable of achieving best orientation to the sun for primary mission while the remaining panels are for contingencies
space,not_removed,it will continue travelling through space until it collides with another object in space or is slowly eroded away by space dust if it is even travelling fast enough to be effected by space dust
space,not_removed,assuming it collides with nothing ever then i suppose it travels until it gets caught into somethings gravity also assuming its not going too fast to be partially unaffected by gravity but yes itll move at a high rate of speed forever until its stopped by blunt force
space,not_removed,i think in a hundred or two years some intrepid robert ballard type will plot its course and speed and set out to recover it to be placed in the future equivalent of the air and space museum
space,not_removed,yup it will travel until it hits something i hope its not an inhabited planet where the aliens will wonder why we are throwing our trash at them
space,not_removed,because the universe is most likely infinite in size voyager will continue to travel through space perpetually regardless of expanding space also the expression for infinity is not a meaningful way to express a quantity because infinity isnt a number its an idea
space,not_removed,perhaps but think if space itself is expanding then voyager itself is expanding too since the space between its atoms and molecules are growing
space,not_removed,and somewhere in england there id an english optimus prime ready to tear shit up
space,not_removed,this is huge i mean this is huge this is hopefully a huge shot in the ass for the average american to quell their apathy towards space and space travel
space,not_removed,taken from a camera on a unmanned space craft km away still better than what i can take of our moon
space,not_removed,so what would this look like if i were standing on europa would jupiter take up half of the sky
space,not_removed,phd in planetary science here specializing in giant planets from voyager taken in the violet filter if anyone is wondering if you actually want the raw image itself you can find it though fair warning that the voyager file format is a notorious pain to work with
space,not_removed,the voyager probes are definitelyy favourite ones especially because voyager could photographate all of the outer planets and that it a quality thats totally ok its so epic one tiny probe could fly all the way through our solar system and passing all the targets no other probe ever came close to
space,not_removed,if you like this sort of content come on over to reuropa where it is all europa all the time
space,not_removed,those were exciting times i remember the voyager approach and how the planetary scientists were getting more and more excited by europa because it did not show any craters implying recent planetwide geological activity scientists are still excited but for the last years they have had trouble getting nasa to return to europa it has been on stalling maneuver after another by nasa hq even after congress dictated the europa clipper
space,not_removed,voyager are probably the most successful space missions ever when you consider how many new worlds were opened up
space,not_removed,now that is dizzying that frame is about a couple of earths across images like this particularly of the jovian clouds really induce vertigo and the thought of cloud formations that colossal is somehow menacing when you mentally stack them up against our entire world
space,not_removed,why the hell is jupiter so fricking big we should do something about it
space,not_removed,why is this rehosted on someones flikr today this is a sad attempt at a karma grab anyone got the original nasa link
space,not_removed,not half the sky but it would take up a great deal of sky
space,not_removed,it would be about degrees across the earths moon is half a degree for comparison thats a ruler held at arms length
space,not_removed,made in space engine
space,not_removed,i were standing on europa hope you like radiation jupiter is one massive cyclotron
space,not_removed,and its still going and possibly sending signals till and when all goes well we will get measurements of the interstellar plasma this year
space,not_removed,yeah its really weird its almost as if nasa doesnt want to go there congress is basically beating them over the head and throwing wads of money at them screaming get to europa already just do it even with more funding than nasa requests theyre still pretty quiet about it and dont seem too enthusiastic
space,not_removed,yeah its hard to argue about that cassini is a close if its not its been in saturns solar system for over a decade and is still churning up incredible pictures new horizons is a pretty incredible probe as well and looks to have many more years and many more objects yet to explore
space,not_removed,its not really a rehost kevin m gill is one of the many people who dig through nasas image archives and reprocess the data as far as i know there isnt an official nasa version of this image kevin just posted his version a few hours ago i assume op just noticed it and linked to it
space,not_removed,this was on the cover of europa reportawesome movie btw
space,not_removed,that looks beautiful imagine if our moon looked like that it would be terrifying too tbh
space,not_removed,i wonder if i would feel pulled towards it
space,not_removed,they know aliens are there and dont want to look so they can continue to focus on
space,not_removed,thanks for explaining that yeah i noticed it was published but couldnt find it in the voyager archives or anywhere else and it seemed like mr gill was behind this so his flickr it was too good a shot not to share
space,not_removed,ah i see i just have a hatred for flikr and always assume its for shameless rehosting
space,not_removed,upvoted for mentioning europa report i liked that movie better than the martian even though being a fan of ridley scott one note though you may have to give this movie some time until it grabs you the editing is a bit much at first but i can see why they did it
space,not_removed,the radiation dose you would get watching it would be far more terrifying
space,not_removed,i noticed it was published but couldnt find it in the voyager archives or anywhere else phd in planetary science here specializing in giant planets though im not exactly sure what gill did to it i was only able to find this by combing through httptoolspdsringssetiorgopus outer planets unified search on nasas httpspdsnasagov planetary data system a nifty browsable database of all outer planet images more people should probably know this tool exists
space,not_removed,how so
space,not_removed,good skills thanks for the tip
space,not_removed,europa is one of the inner jovian moons and it gets a lot of radiation from jupiters massive radiation belt the levels on the surface would be lethal it would be a high price to pay for a nice view memories that would last a lifetime even if that is only a few days
space,not_removed,what is the source of the radiation belt around jupiter
space,not_removed,isnt europa semiok like you could survive a short trip just not a long one io would kill you in minutes callisto is pretty darn safe not much worse than being in the iss
space,not_removed,jupiter has a strong magnetic field so it has strong van allen radiation belts too which are significantly beefed up by ios stripped off and ionized atmosphere
space,not_removed,can you link me where you learned about this
space,not_removed,i studied it in the past but am just recalling it at this point you should google jupiter system the wikipedia page itself should have plenty of information on it ive gotten stuck for days hoping from one moon to the next
space,not_removed,therell be a live stream starting soon available here httplivestreamcomesarosettagrandfinale
space,not_removed,this is pretty neat and a little sad this was a historic mission that i was excited to be alive to see and now its endingdoes that mean its time to pour one out for rosetta
space,not_removed,hmm hopefully we will have enough good pictures to create nice timelapse video that would be nice
space,not_removed,nbsp im a bot please report any issue on httpsgithubcomopenseadragonredditbotissues
space,not_removed,i definitely heard about the giant red spot on jupiter but i never heard about this vortex on saturn it looks scary o edit wow this is my highest upvoted comment right now this is incredible
space,not_removed,whats the source for this ive never seen a picture this close and last i checked it was a hexagon is this the middle of the hexagon or an artists impression
space,not_removed,thats pretty awesomehow big is it comparativelyz
space,not_removed,if you fly in with a damaged fighter youll visit kobol then return some weeks later in a perfectly refurbished one
space,not_removed,are there any studies with the estimated speeds and environment down on the pole this looks amazing
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,this looks like the entrance to hell from dantes inferno or the lake in the cinematic from the beginning of dark souls
space,not_removed,lets give nasa enough money to make a documentary on the planets in david attenborough and neil degrasse tyson can be conarriators
space,not_removed,why does this image twitch like an optical illusion when i look at it is it just me
space,not_removed,id love to have this as a rotating animated wallpaper on my phone looks amazing
space,not_removed,its like one of those old falling forever screen savers
space,not_removed,it would be very interesting to fly down into that vortex and see all the different layers
space,not_removed,literally the anus of our system i was on a mining expedition to neptune a few years back had to make a pit stop all they had was an arbys and a loves truck stop if we werent on e we definitely would have skipped this hole im probably a little bitter the lot lizard that hopped in my rig that night ended up being my baby momma
space,not_removed,this isnt the back of the a yugioh card yuuuu giiiiii ohhhhhhh da da da duuuueeeelllll
space,not_removed,i read this as the suns north pole ive sat here for minutes wondering why the sun was blue im a fucking idiot
space,not_removed,nice to see so many people caring about space the only thing that really matters
space,not_removed,if you looking closely youll notice and rei initiating third impact
space,not_removed,anyone see the wreckage from starbucks viper anywhere i know this is where she went down
space,not_removed,what a time to be alive we can access a live stream to the iss and see earth from abovewe have high res pics of planets like plutodamn its a shame i wont be alive to see what happens in years
space,not_removed,i love everything space how majestic it is yet terrifyingly hostile no need for god or heaven for me il be happy to die and go back to being dust lawrence krauss says it perfectly forget jesus the stars died so you could be here today
space,not_removed,thats crazy i wonder if it would explode if there was a spark or if the lack of would prevent it
space,not_removed,for some reason i glanced at this as the vortex at satans north pole
space,not_removed,what would happen if someone or something fell onto saturn will it go through the planet until the center
space,not_removed,if you like that the double vortex on venus is cool also httpmesaintouractivitiesspacesciencevenusexpressdoublevortexatvenussouthpoleunveiled
space,not_removed,anyone know what is at the center of the vortex and how far deep into the planet it goes i wouldnt imagine it reached the core
space,not_removed,would it be possible for a probe to fly down into the vortex from above and use retro propulsion to slow down enough to study the wall of gases without getting shredded on earth its pretty calm in the center of a hurricane so i wonder if its the same inside this one if the atmospheric pressure is significantly lower inside the eye maybe we could potentially descend low enough to get a better idea of saturns makeup below
space,not_removed,i see my ex wife got back to suckin everything in sight after the divorce
space,not_removed,it is just amazing to me that so much research has been done and so many discoveries have been made from here on earth millions miles away i wish the whole world could just get along so that a lot of the money that is being spent on defense protection war etc could be used on space study and exploration
space,not_removed,you guys didnt know about cthulhus butt hole shit that place is the best bar in the solar system
space,not_removed,am i the only one who thinks it looks like the back of a yugioh card
space,not_removed,i thought it was a hexagon also didnt it change colour randomly last year
space,not_removed,is this letting us see deep into the atmosphere of saturn or is it just an optical illusion
space,not_removed,if you look closely you can see you matthew mcconaughey coming out of it
space,not_removed,i thought the vortex was hexagonal in shape why is it circular in the photo
space,not_removed,damn i though saturns poles were hexagonal
space,not_removed,i want to see what it looks like from the inside about halfway down photoshop artists activate please
space,not_removed,im not saying its a dimensional portal but its a dimensional portal
space,not_removed,i wish we could send mars curiositylike machines to all the planets and take photos from inside id love to see what the ground and atmosphere look like from inside
space,not_removed,thats such a cool pic im a generally riskadverse individual but theres a large part of me that wants to go there to open the secret entrance and meet the demonic saturn santa
space,not_removed,it looks like there is a giant eyeball in the center looking back at you
space,not_removed,i thought this thing was a hexagon or is that a different spot on saturn
space,not_removed,some believe saturn is symbol of satan satyr and send out evil mind controlling sounds google the sounds of saturn nasa has released the sounds and they are kinda scary
space,not_removed,if you were inside it say in a ship able to withstand whatever environment that was on the outside what would it be like how fast would the wind if there is even wind be going
space,not_removed,anyone see the wreckage from starbucks viper anywhere i know this is where she went down
space,not_removed,one day when we burn all of our planets carbon emissions we too will look at that awesome
space,not_removed,there are freaking vortices on vortices on vortices holy mother of god
space,not_removed,how about the south pole i wanna see the south pole hole i love south pole hole
space,not_removed,this is so beautiful to me imagine living in a space station orbiting saturn
space,not_removed,thank you for this rall is terribly political right now and i love seeing this on here
space,not_removed,saturn is the death star that hexagon is a weapon that can destroy planets
space,not_removed,anyone else see the humanoid form in the orange clouds at about oclock
space,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsfkdcqgnjho
space,not_removed,if i could choose how i will die it would be to fall in this in slow motion
space,not_removed,i dont remember being there must have been really great party seriously though i remember there being a hexagonal cloud on saturns north pole is this a new development
space,not_removed,i like to think that at the center is a powerful mage holding shit together
space,not_removed,so is this flat and the colors are playing with my eyes or is this a legit vortex
space,not_removed,i came here reading santas north pole was greatly dissappointed
space,not_removed,thing is though what wavelength is the picture took at if we would see that with our own eyes as we looked down on saturn then woah
space,not_removed,i kept searching for the millennium falcon in the pic as a promo for star wars viii
space,not_removed,this looks like that little glass wizard sorcery object that resurfaces every couple months
space,not_removed,there is some frightening shit in our solar system interestingbut still frightening
space,not_removed,this is where the reality we perceive is beamed from the signal amplified by the moon
space,not_removed,iv never seen this vortex sucking in on saturn before definitely seen and heard of the vortex blowing out on uranus
space,not_removed,a gigantic vortex that would swallow the earth whole like a pebble in a toilette bowl holy shit
space,not_removed,hm interesting i never would of guessed my wife and saturn have so much in common
space,not_removed,we have a polar vortex on earth which oddly enough means its less likely to snow there
space,not_removed,not sure how to phrase this is the middle closer to the surface does it get deeper as you move toward the center
space,not_removed,wow the color of it is amazing this is really freaky but awesome at the same time nice shot
space,not_removed,this looks like that giant glass marble that was posted a couple days ago
space,not_removed,looks a lot like a zoomedin version of that glass paperweight optical illusion from yesterday
space,not_removed,last time i checked it had a hexagon shape instead of circular any explanation
space,not_removed,is this colorized or relatively i guess natural light exposure
space,not_removed,we continue to learn more about atmospheric and since it is a gas giant it is pretty much all atmosphere with each new probe that passes by jupiter hopefully we will begin to be able to penetrate the violent layers of gas to determine completely the physical nature and composition of those gases with better construction of probes that we send than we have now
space,not_removed,such small wonders on a galactic scale but imagine being inside the hexagon in a glass life support bubble
space,not_removed,im looking forward to the day that we got some awesome drone footage from this vortex
space,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment sort of like when you put water over certain sounds if you really want to know what saturn sounds like here you go its a shutter speed effect like the helicopter rotors that dont move or the rolling prop blades sorry for mobile linkthis is cool af this is what i heard its time to duel im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch ill keep this updated as long as i can httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get me on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
space,not_removed,it is absolutely terrifying and captivating at the same time what an incredible shot
space,not_removed,i am not sure what a vortex is but that is an amazing shot i am always amazed when i see these pictures how far we have come to be able to view such a thing
space,not_removed,at the moment the couple of posts above this on the feed are about trump i read the headline for this and assumed it was a joke about trump too
space,not_removed,that looks like a somebody opened a plug at the bottom of the ocean
space,not_removed,im pretty sure this is where mount olympus is look at that white formation on the left does it not look like a greek goddess holding a ball
space,not_removed,wish i could find it but this looks like a close up of that optically illusion galaxy orb gif posted awhile ago
space,not_removed,there would be no sight in the solar system more epic to see than sinking down into the lowest point in the middle and looking at the walls of the storm swirling around in seemingly slow motion around you especially with the often low angle of the sun projecting dramatic shadows and whatnot but these colours look fake to me cool but fake im guessing the real thing isnt quite so saturated and would be more greyish in real life
space,not_removed,another of saturns north pole
space,not_removed,i read that as satans north pole and thought yep looks about right
space,not_removed,i wonder if the people on that planet are tired of hearing about the polar vortex
space,not_removed,reminds me of a descent into the maelstrom by edgar allan poe
space,not_removed,heres a size comparison i made last time this vortex post was trending httpiimgurcomwitwkprjpg
space,not_removed,im sure you have its a very detailed image of the hexagon shape on saturns north pole
space,not_removed,it does and why it happens someone please explain or has it already been explained
space,not_removed,it looks like dantes inferno
space,not_removed,we need a size comparison of these two reddit im calling you
space,not_removed,yeah i never heard that too
space,not_removed,it is a hexagon if you just google the image youll see its from the cassini mission the image from op is false color
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,the hexagon is a much larger feature and yes this is in the middle of it as far as i can ascertain this and the hexagon photos were all obtained by cassini
space,not_removed,you can see it better in that one whatya call it painting i think i was called starry starry vortex
space,not_removed,i was curious too so i found a pic of the hexagon on wikipedia which says a side of the hexagon is km by using a little muzzy measuring the vortex appears to be around km in diameter which is smaller than i was expecting its about the distance from denver to dc or paris to athens greece big but pretty small for something the size of saturn
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,there must be some kind of way outta here
space,not_removed,starbuck for the win rip starbuck so say we all and remember always all of this has happened before and will happen again
space,not_removed,the proverbial plot line toilet
space,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikikobol or httpsenwikipediaorgwikikolob i always get my fantasy universes mixed up
space,not_removed,is a color composite the closest to real life color we can get from these photos
space,not_removed,so this is a real image i thought it was another artists rendering at first
space,not_removed,definitely i see some faces in there
space,not_removed,it reminded me of travelling through a stargate
space,not_removed,id imagine that a video transmitted from saturn would take forever to complete
space,not_removed,neil degrasse tyson do you want saturn to not be a planet thats how you get saturn to not be a planet
space,not_removed,i used to have one of those on my first computer a
space,not_removed,i went on a mining expedition once we woke up one morning and there was a distress signal coming from the moon of this one gas giant we landed and a few of the crew went out to investigate a derelict ship to make a long story short the entire crew was killed off by a parasite save for a cat and myself it was terrible dont even get me started on what happened next
space,not_removed,i empathize but frankly if you are picking up women from saturn you only have yourself to blame
space,not_removed,ended up being my baby momma omg dad no cries
space,not_removed,i thought uranus was the anus of our system
space,not_removed,i was looking for this comment ahaha
space,not_removed,i read santas north pole was a little concern about what i was going to tell my son next xmas
space,not_removed,the immense pressure would crush it on saturn it rains diamonds
space,not_removed,was thinking exactly the same thing
space,not_removed,possibly zoomed in enough to lose sight of the hexagon outline
space,not_removed,yeah this is at the very center of that larger hexagon region
space,not_removed,just the north pole the southern one resembles the big red dot on jupiters surface
space,not_removed,saturn is huge as far as i know that formation could eat the earth and not notice a thing
space,not_removed,there isnt really a ground in saturn
space,not_removed,this is just the very center of the hexagon
space,not_removed,could it besatan all i could think about while reading your post
space,not_removed,i believe the radiation would cook you in short order but im not certain
space,not_removed,short answer yes longer answer probably but the depth into the cloud is significantly less than the diameter of the vortex rough guess km deeper than the highest clouds
space,not_removed,the hexagon is huge compared to ops vortex this is a zoomed in pic
space,not_removed,its zoomed in too far to see it a picture of the south pole and hexagon the vortex is the little dot in the middle
space,not_removed,i just noticed that thing is so big it has smaller vortexes within the big one look top right
space,not_removed,oh shit the size of stuff in space and space itself never ceases to freak me out
space,not_removed,that is so strange that its a hexagon shape how is that possible
space,not_removed,awesome graphics im sure these will be storming all along the web over and over again if they already havent done so
space,not_removed,it doesnt look like a hexagon to me
space,not_removed,any theories on why it doesnt look like a hexagon in this photo
space,not_removed,close its actually an image of the vortex at the center of the hexagon
space,not_removed,httpimgurcombuvcukx should be close enough excuse my potentially crappy attempt at colorizing the hexagon with photoshop
space,not_removed,speaking of cassini i cannot wait to see the pictures we get in september
space,not_removed,false color space pics bum me out
space,not_removed,why is it hexagon shaped
space,not_removed,the center of the hexagon looks like the ops picture without the color enhancements though
space,not_removed,thats kind of cool a tiny vortex at the center of a large polar hexagon pretty neat
space,not_removed,how would a hexagon with sides km in length only have a diameter of km i feel like youre missing a zero or im missing some part of the explanation edit nope vortex hexagon im missing part of the explanation
space,not_removed,i live near denver and im pretty sure i drove through that thing once in kansasas i was heading towards dc
space,not_removed,thanksyeahthat thing is awesomemaybe one day theyll send a satellite down into itlolz
space,not_removed,those pics are remarkable i love cassini
space,not_removed,said the joker to the thief
space,not_removed,yep the image is taken times in black and white each with a different color filter rgb you can then take the filtered black and white images and reproduce the color image how a red filter lets red light through but blocks the blue and green even though its photographed in black and white you get info on the colors based on what went through the filter and what was blocked and then can reproduce the color so why the fuck not take color pictures bandwidth
space,not_removed,well latency would be the only truly insurmountable obstacle which would be at best minutes or at worst minutes the rest is just determined by how much money you can throw at getting a gigantic powerful transmitter all the way to saturn
space,not_removed,what does ndt have to do with that are you still upset about pluto
space,not_removed,i hope you nuked the site from orbit its the only way to be sure
space,not_removed,i guess im gonna be on space maury
space,not_removed,ok but lets suppose we built something that would resist to the pressure the rain and everything else would it go through the entire planet or will it find something solid
space,not_removed,i love space stuff but i have definitely whatever that phobia is that makes you scared of huge objects floating in space and the next closest object is millions of miles away
space,not_removed,space is so wonderfully scary
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,aliens it is one of those weird things that happen in fluid dynamics it has been recreated on an obviously smaller scale in labs fast moving gasesfluids going around a globe create different bodies at different latitudes between these masses faster moving gasfluid forms corridors which dont follow a perfectly circular pattern on earth we see a similar thing in the form of the on earth we have land masses and bodies of water with different salt concentrations which break up the pattern which isnt the case on saturn basically it is saturns jet stream without anything below it preventing it from forming a more permanentimmobile corridor
space,not_removed,heres a better image
space,not_removed,doesnt look like anything to me
space,not_removed,this is a tighter shot the hexagonal edges are farther out
space,not_removed,cause this is the center the edges are further out
space,not_removed,if youre thinking of an up close image of saturn dont expect too much saturn will fill the camera fov and cassini is moving too fast plus downlink bandwidth is limited
space,not_removed,think of it like our eyes are too shitty to differentiate between colours and see outside our visible spectrum so we use technology to see for us just like we cant go there ourselves so we build stuff that can its a bummer we cant see it with the eyes we were born with but better than that we made our own eyes
space,not_removed,most everything in space is poorly lit though
space,not_removed,is this really false like do we know how different it would look in real life
space,not_removed,its a fluid dynamics thing essentially the hexagon is the path of least resistance due to the counterflow lower in the hemisphere
space,not_removed,because saturns are always needing a repair or two
space,not_removed,i was under the impression that if you stretch a sine wave around a circle youll get a sort of hexagon like you see on saturn basically its no different from anything else youd expect to see except stretched around a pole making it look weird that being said i really have no clue what im talking about and anyone is free to tell me if and why im incorrect
space,not_removed,cuz its core is a cube sorry not sorry if i lead you into a conspiratory rabbit hole dont google or youtube saturn cube matrix
space,not_removed,the hexagonal structure is a result of the frequencies emitted by the immense forces of the stormy atmosphere look into cymatics for more information
space,not_removed,a tiny vortex that could swallow your state
space,not_removed,how wild would it be if the eye of that vortex was the only place on the planet stable enough that life could evolve and it found a way
space,not_removed,the vortex is at the center of the hexagon
space,not_removed,hexagons shrink spacetime
space,not_removed,im pretty sure i slept through most of it while making that drive a couple years ago all i remember is corn and a big storm cloud that didnt blow us off the road there may or may not have been a wind turbine exploding in the distance
space,not_removed,we wont be sending anything down into the vortex any time soon but were sending cassini into saturn and through its rings before that on september cassini will plunge through saturns atmosphere its clouds and fog collecting and sending data right up until its final minutes i seriously hope it can send some pics before it dies
space,not_removed,i hope so toox however i would much rather a lander on io enceladus or europa much more likely to have interesting resultsq
space,not_removed,not only is color a problem for the general public but size as well it needs a pic of the earth to scale for comparison saturn is enormous
space,not_removed,you get much more data by taking a series of individually exposed red green blue luminance frames because the camera is mono black and white every single pixel will capture the filtered red green blue it is exposed to via the colour filter if you use a colour camera rgb like your camera at home then the sensor will be made up in a bayer pattern where certain parts will only pick up red green or blue see httpswwweconsystemscomimagesarticlergbirandbayerformatpng this means that even those you are exposing everything to the same amount of light only certain parts of the sensor can pick up certain colours basically lowering the resolution
space,not_removed,nowadays everybody wanna talk like they forgot about pluto
space,not_removed,that is an alien thought you have there
space,not_removed,as far as we know saturn is all gas
space,not_removed,i think its called being a normal human being
space,not_removed,there is no phobia for that because its not an unreasonable fear like fear of dying
space,not_removed,i am so glad that we dont just fall off space really isnt that far away
space,not_removed,there is a difference between having a reasonable aversion or fear of something and a phobia the conflation of these two is one of my largest pet peeves its like someone who likes things tidy saying im soooo ocd
space,not_removed,the next closest object is millions of miles away erm the moon is only a quarter of a million miles away and a huge asteroid passed within miles of the earth just yesterday sleep well
space,not_removed,yeah it is its a weird feeling to try to figure it out and realize that you dont have the computational power to even begin to understand it
space,not_removed,i wonder what the science is of it retaining that shape so fascinating
space,not_removed,the hexagon is there because saturn needs to be tightened up every once in a while with a giant space wrench
space,not_removed,so the original image is the storm at the center of the hexagon
space,not_removed,what if this is just the place you are supposed to use a giant allen wrench
space,not_removed,wow question when i die can my remains be sent into this vortex yet
space,not_removed,closer httpsimgurcomlfjljnb
space,not_removed,the vortex is not meant for you
space,not_removed,the edges are on the edge source edgucator
space,not_removed,thats good to know thank you
space,not_removed,yeah i know that closeup images of saturn are a long shot but i hope they can position the probe somewhere interesting as it goes down
space,not_removed,grey fog then
space,not_removed,i cant even express these things properly because i have to conceptualize complex ideas in this stupid limiting spoken language
space,not_removed,so if i was to see saturn with my own eyes it would be black and white assuming there was sufficient light i thought it was the pictures that were in black and white because of the type of camera used
space,not_removed,its not that theyre poorly lit per se its that a conventional camera which takes pictures in optical wavelengths offers little of scientific value probes have very constrained requirements across the board every ounce of power space and weight is important scientists would rather have something like a spectrometer on a probe than a high resolution color optical camera
space,not_removed,hey god get some better lighting in here jfc
space,not_removed,ooh hold on there this is actually my field i did my phd thesis on giant planet atmospheres and a lot of folks in the field strongly disagree that this laboratory hexagon is a good analogy for the actual hexagon the biggest problem is that the laboratory hexagon is supported by vortices one on each side which are very notably missing from saturns hexagon even at depth given the lack of supporting vortices its looking far more likely this is a stationary rossby wave in a meandering jetstream and the surrounding winds at depth across latitude and with this coriolis force make a planetary wavenumber of the most stable solution reproducing the hexagon without the need for vortices both might both produce hexagon shapes but theyre for very different reasons
space,not_removed,do you have any clue as to why it forms a hexagon and not any other type of polygon like what exactly is it thats breaking the symmetry here im not quite sure what the β r₀ or e parameters are but i would imagine that given that theyre stated at the beginning of the video they must ultimately be what dictates the final fluid flow do you know if altering these parameters can lead to some other kind of polygon shape appearing out of the fluid flow for example a pentagon or an octagon
space,not_removed,thank you was just looking for something to watch on youtube
space,not_removed,cosmic rays satans eye black abyss where light dies
space,not_removed,that was fun kind of lacks any consistent concept thought the cube part was fun but at some points it kept repeating spooky images or simply smacked together completely random stuff also stanley kubrick monolith saturns moon in the book later changed to jupiter in the movie ha
space,not_removed,yes i probably should have said relatively tiny edits trying to be nicer
space,not_removed,swallow plenty of countries as well
space,not_removed,heck yes marking that date on my calendar
space,not_removed,i seriously hope it can send some pics before it dies i hope so too but cassini has transmitted way more data than expected i love cassini and the steelyeyed missilepeople who extended its mission by absurdly complicated orbital maneuvers even if it explodes today cassini is one of the most remarkable missions of my lifetime i always want more but godsdamn nasa has been killing it for the last decade
space,not_removed,eh to each their own hesheit also over uses periods ¯ツ¯
space,not_removed,yes but as you descended through saturn the gas would be compressed until it eventually became solid
space,not_removed,its just the common realization of how small people are
space,not_removed,there is a difference between having a reasonable fear and a phobia some people have a reasonable fear of snakes and wouldnt want to touch one others see a picture of a snake and have a panic attack most people dont look forward to death and are afraid of the unknown aspect others are phobic about it and it interferes with their ability to live life happily
space,not_removed,fear of dying is a phobia its called thanatophobia
space,not_removed,i see so is most peoples arachnophobia not actually a phobia spiders are actually dangerous
space,not_removed,exactly a lot of people know that space is big but many dont fully understand how fucking huge it is huge is actually an understatement no word can describe the vastness space has to offer im one of those people who thinks there is an end to the universe but im confident humans will never ever reach it so its irrelevant to think about i dont think its infinite but my god is it hard to comprehend how god damn tiny we are
space,not_removed,discussed in another comment
space,not_removed,i was fascinated too and my layman understanding is that this can be produced in a lab using liquid something about the planets atmosphere makes it move like a fluid and the storm has the right conditions to make it that shape
space,not_removed,a hexagon is naturally space efficient think about it like this a sphere or circle is the most natural shape for a bubble to be in right well if you push several circles together either they deform into hexagons or theres a lot of free space in the gaps so the hexagon shape is a result of the pressure caused by the surrounding gases
space,not_removed,theres a brief discussion of it on but surprisingly brief saturn is a gas giant with a deep fluid atmosphere the hexagon phenomenon has been with video by spinning a circular tank of liquid at different speeds in its center and its perimeter the slower and faster layers of liquid interfering with one another form standing waves that generate sixsided patterns most often but can be made to form three or eightsided patterns at different speeds its been shown that a standing sine wave on a flat surface flowing in a circle sort of unfolds into a hexagon hexagons are made of each side of which is the radius of a circle touching all six corners so if a circular motion is going to be interfered with in a way that would form an angular figure a hexagon represents the most circlefriendly polygon this is also seen when bees stand armslength apart and build little cells around themselves one bee would naturally build a circle neighboring bees sharing walls would form with arms length out to the corners and slightly less to the walls
space,not_removed,my guess is its over a magnetic pole which tries to shape the clouds but the clouds rotating rapidly gives it an odd gyroscopic twist oh come on thats clever which causes it to spirograph into a pillowed looking hexagon but then again i flunked out of astrophysics school might not be the best guy to take conjecture from
space,not_removed,i like to think of planets as something similar to atoms or molecules just like a snowflake has geometric patterns so can planets
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,holds the rings on its in the manual part
space,not_removed,dang i only brought my giant space saw
space,not_removed,yes zoomed in and false colour
space,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiexplorationofsaturn but it would be very expensive
space,not_removed,the cameras cant transmit in real time plus due to early budget cuts the cameras lacks a scan platform which means the spacecraft antenna will be pointing towards earth in the final minutes and the camera view is controlled by rolling the spacecraft
space,not_removed,let this soak into your noodle for a bit and see what happens httpsenwikipediaorgwikilinguisticrelativity
space,not_removed,no it would look something like edit by the way you can look at saturn with your own eyes through a telescope it doesnt even have to be a huge one fixed link sorry for the inconvenience
space,not_removed,its been years since the first modern behavior emerged among the human species teenagers send pocket cameras into the stratosphere with just helium how the fuck did nobody think about putting a goddamn popup flash on those spacecrafts you morons god
space,not_removed,i bet this is what its like trying to read a book in a dream i know these are letters but it just doesnt go any further than that
space,not_removed,thank you for existing the world needs more of you
space,not_removed,please consider if you havent already making science communication a significant part of your career thanks
space,not_removed,awesome this is the type of reply i was hoping for i was typing up my reply below while you were typing it seems im curious is there is an easy to list set of physical parameters that controls the stable solution for example do you know what youd have to toy around with to get an octagonal structure to form do you have any papers on this phenomenon that you can point to me to
space,not_removed,astromike the hero the legend
space,not_removed,just learned about rossby waves on a random wiki walk never even thought about them being stationary i wonder what would it take to get an polygon with or whatever number of sides how does it behave as it goes to the limit of being circular edit also this post as a magic the gathering card
space,not_removed,happy to see the physics department at nmt getting some love
space,not_removed,your words are like science porn
space,not_removed,i understood about half of that could you do an
space,not_removed,nah were pretty meh thats why so many of us leave in our dont get me wrong great place to grow up great place to raise a family and people there are the nicest you will ever meet but its super boring and the job market is anything but diverse
space,not_removed,were also unimaginably large though there is a long way to zoom out to appreciate the size of the observable universe theres considerably more to zoom into at least from a human sized perspective the size of the planck length can be visualized as follows if a particle or dot about mm in size which is approximately the smallest the unaided human eye can see were magnified in size to be as large as the observable universe then inside that universesized dot the planck length would be roughly the size of an actual mm dot in other words a mm dot is halfway between the planck length and the size of the observable universe on a logarithmic scale
space,not_removed,can you explain the correlation between weather and sine waves
space,not_removed,is that whats happening when people say the polar vortex is hitting minnesota or is that something different
space,not_removed,so what youre saying is that the sickest kick drum ever lies atop saturns pole how do i sample this
space,not_removed,if i could afford gold i would give it to this explanation ive been curious about saturns hexagon for years somehow nobody has put it clearly to me like this did its a standing wave so its basically a large scale form of harmonics
space,not_removed,as umienaikoe rightly pointed out that its rossby waves if you want it to be more accurate this pattern captured in the original image is referred to as jet streams by nasa in simple language jet streams are zones of high turbulence and high wind in the upper belts of the rossby waves pilots often try to avoid this turbulence zone during their flights a simple explanation of the formation of rossby waves is the disturbance caused when cold air from the poles meets the hot air from the subtropics and it gets this curve shape because of the coriolis force which is a fictional force since were observing our motions in a rotating earth it deflects every object moving in a line to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the south in the southern hemisphere you can approximately hold it responsible when you see curve wind patterns in a large scale weather map but if we look at the saturn image it has a hexagonal shape with pretty sharp peaks and although we can model it by a harmonic oscillator according to my understanding it has to do with how the local temperature gradient and other forces like coriolis and pressure gradient force are different for saturn hence we dont see the same shape we observe on earth a harmonic oscillator which comes back to the same position like an oscillating pendulum mathematically you can express it by a sine wave which is the simplest of the repeating curves most of this was already pointing out im just trying my best to explain terms avoiding complicated terminology if possible i hope it helped
space,not_removed,the polar vortex brought weather in december of saskatchewan canada
space,not_removed,isnt that more of a triangle wave
space,not_removed,does wikipedia need to update there expansion section on the page for this then
space,not_removed,fluid includes both liquids and gases
space,not_removed,sort of like
space,not_removed,thats why hexagons form in some systems but thats not why one forms in this system
space,not_removed,where are the other circles on saturn
space,not_removed,only available from the dealership and its for what is essentially an wrench

space,not_removed,that is plenty terrifying in fact the lack of differentiation over such an expanse makes all the more monstrous
space,not_removed,also applies to reading drunk or high
space,not_removed,this pattern captured in the original image is referred to as jet streams by nasa in simple language jet streams are zones of high turbulence and high wind in the upper belts of the rossby waves upper atmosphere pilots often try to avoid this turbulence zone during their flights a simple explanation of the formation of rossby waves is the disturbance caused when cold air from the poles meets the hot air from the subtropics and it gets this curve shape because of the coriolis force which is a fictional force since were observing our motions in a rotating earth it deflects every object moving in a line to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere you can approximately hold it responsible when you see curve wind patterns in a large scale weather map but if we look at the saturn image it has a hexagonal shape with pretty sharp peaks and although we can model it by a harmonic oscillator according to my understanding it has to do with how the local temperature gradient and other forces like coriolis and pressure gradient force are different for saturn hence we dont see the same shape we observe on earth a harmonic oscillator which comes back to the same position like an oscillating pendulum mathematically you can express it by a sine wave which is the simplest of the repeating curves most of this was already pointing out im just trying my best to explain terms avoiding complicated terminology if possible i hope it helped
space,not_removed,exactly i know all of those words but when theyre strung together like that i have no idea what was said
space,not_removed,there are a few free parameters here to play around with in essence these are the knobs you fiddle with to get certain wavenumbers to be the most stable among them are coriolis force this is dependent on how fast the planet rotates and where on the planet the wave is located obviously you cant change how fast the planet rotates since theyre trying to reproduce this on saturn but you can get different waves on different planets depending on how fast they spin you can also change the latitude of the feature to get different waves potential vorticity gradient this is essentially how the eastwest wind changes in the northsouth direction this often requires some serious fine tuning and subtle changes can make a big difference this will determine if you have nice stable jets oscillating jets chaotic jets or jets that spin off or feed vortices think great red spot on jupiter vertical wind shear this is how the eastwest wind changes in the updown direction this also strongly affects the stability of the jet and how likely you are to spin off vortices it also turns out to be directly linked to the change in temperature in the northsouth direction by the thermal wind equation you cant change one without changing the other in terms of reading a geophysical fluid dynamics book is probably your best bet the one by vallis atmospheric and oceanic fluid dynamics is probably the best textbook on the subject with chapter instability being the really relevant bit here there are some nice figures showing as well as grows fastest youve got to know a lot of math to get through it specifically differential equations
space,not_removed,i already did one
space,not_removed,maybe a gigantic polar vortex could liven things up a little
space,not_removed,kind of unrelated but pretty much everything can be represented by sine waves in on way or another
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,waiting for busyworksbeats to drop a video on it after your comment
space,not_removed,its really about the math of the noble hexagon not an atmospheric phenomenon is a perfect number since x x equilateral hexagons can perfectly tesselate like triangles and squares so they have more reason to emerge in nature than other polygons
space,not_removed,whhaaaaaaattttt how
space,not_removed,the is for delivery because saturn
space,not_removed,false color is usually to high light frequencies thats not visible to the human eye but in this case it looks more like lightning than false color to me
space,not_removed,actually drunk maybe while high not really
space,not_removed,reading high this is actually my field i did my phd thesis on giant planet atmospheres oh wow thats so cool i didnt know that was a thing and a lot of folks in the field wait what field this is actually my field i did my phd thesis on giant planet atmospheres oh yeah wow thats cool he must be super smart
space,not_removed,or reading after staying up for over hours
space,not_removed,thank you i got it that time
space,not_removed,heres the thing you said a jackdaw is a crow is it in the same family yes no ones arguing that as someone who is a scientist who studies crows i am telling you specifically in science no one calls jackdaws crows if you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either theyre not the same thing if youre saying crow family youre referring to the taxonomic grouping of corvidae which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens so your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people call the black ones crows lets get grackles and blackbirds in there then too also calling someone a human or an ape its not one or the other thats not how taxonomy works theyre both a jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family but thats not what you said you said a jackdaw is a crow which is not true unless youre okay with calling all members of the crow family crows which means youd call blue jays ravens and other birds crows too which you said you dont its okay to just admit youre wrong you know
space,not_removed,i appreciate the response id like to look into this stuff at some point so ill definitely make sure to make a note of the textbook i find fluid dynamics quite fascinating but unfortunately my statmech lectures were incredibly dry and unengaging and as a result they werent the classes i was strongest in ive not really done anything remotely related to the area yet but perhaps some day
space,not_removed,you should head the nd board of tourism youd be a hit with your fresh new ideas
space,not_removed,nonmobile link httpsenwikipediaorgwikirossbywave helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
space,not_removed,since saturn is a gaseous planet its safe to say these rossby waves are atmospheric so does this happen all the way down to the core im imagining it wouldnt be that way unless the core was bigger than the speculated earth size
space,not_removed,what exactly makes it behave like a sine wave how does trig factor into it what ind of math models this
space,not_removed,the whole thread of your answers is interesting as f thank you so much
space,not_removed,dont worry thats just the monster we trapped in its core
space,not_removed,the atmospheric phenomenon explains why we dont observe such pattern on earth than in saturn
space,not_removed,if youre particularly interested in the atmospheric dynamics then introduction to dynamic meteorology by holton is a good read as well
space,not_removed,it probably only happens in the cold upper layers of the atmosphere where wind speeds are fast and the atmosphere isnt very dense going deeper into saturn means things getting hotter denser and slower and eventually the conditions change enough that the process that makes the upper atmosphere form that particular feature simply doesnt work
space,not_removed,we dont really know what the center of gas giants is like we for example dont know whether its core is hydrogen metal or just other metals like iron we arent likely to find out soon because everything we send breaks up in the heat and pressure of free fall
space,not_removed,simply speaking because sine is the most httpsenwikipediaorgwikisimpleharmonicmotion anything less sine shaped is more complex in case of standing waves it depends on what your boundary conditions are so they could be forced to be less sine shaped
space,not_removed,its a gorgeous picture but other than the fact that there are stars in the frame what exactly does this have to do with space am i missing something
space,not_removed,as seen from pacaya i stayed a night at the little shack that monitors fuego fuego does force evacuations but we didnt see so much as a little fart of smoke or lava
space,not_removed,this is cool and all but why is a picture of a volcano in the space sub because there are stars theyre not identified mentioned or even clearly pictured by this logic any photograph with the moon in frame can be eligible look heres a picture of httpwwwlovethispiccomuploadedimagesmoonoverthecityjpg i swear if this volcano gets over points im done with this sub its turned into an i fucking love science clone edit holy shit guys seriously at least of you are sane peace
space,not_removed,i believe thats from acatanango right next to fuego and slightly higher pacaya is much further south i visited it in january you can walk up to an overlook of the north face which erupted in iirc it looks rather like mt st helens and is about the same height meters fuego is m it overlooks the little historical town of antigua guatemala a great place to visit
space,not_removed,volcán de fuego must be the least innovative name for a volcano its a beautiful one though
space,not_removed,is this a bait post not in the right sub upvoted very fast in a short timespan the website has a phishing attempt hidden in it
space,not_removed,thats exactly what i was thinking its easily on its way to getting several thousand points too i like this sub but this kind of post has become too common
space,not_removed,pacaya is not nearly as high as fuego this photo seems to be from the top or near the top of acatenango
space,not_removed,how big is pacaya right now last i heard it pretty much blew itself off the face of the earth but i guess it builds up again after a while
space,not_removed,that is a sweet moon pic tho
space,not_removed,the vestmannaeyjar islands off the southern coast of iceland have a few volcanoes that id love to go back to the crater on the island heimay is cool you can walk into the crater and dig your hands into the cinders to feel the warmth of the earth locals bake bread there
space,not_removed,the volcanoes in guatemala are actually close to major cities and easily accessible pacaya is just south of guatemala city agua fuego and acatenango are visible from antigua and santiaguito is just a short way from xela i cant think of a good reason to visit guatemala city other than business but antigua and xela are quite popular with people who want to learn spanish lots of spanish schools there
space,not_removed,also what an unimaginative name for a volcano
space,not_removed,yep i thought pacaya sounded wrong acatenango for sure
space,not_removed,this is exactly what happened to me i am at work too fuck this post
space,not_removed,adblock takes care of it nicely
space,not_removed,i dont get the whole thing about sites offering free desktop backgrounds or screensavers literally any image in pretty much any format can be a desktop background or screensaver
space,not_removed,and it doesnt take much to change the resolution if needed either i think its just to draw traffic to the website without cost hoping that at least some visitors will check out whatever else they have to offer
space,not_removed,hollywood must have flipped the moon on the horizontal axis after they were done with it s
space,not_removed,thats a piece of low frame rate film and someone has flipped it during the scanningconversion process
space,not_removed,not sure exactly what happened either but even this has one photo one way and one the other
space,not_removed,im figuring the apollo footage is mirrored horizontally and the google moon image is as would naturally be seen because the front part of the moon on google moon is as you see it in the sky its just odd to me i see no reason for it i dont doubt for a second we went to the moon but i cant explain the mirroring
space,not_removed,dont be ridiculous the computers back then werent as strong as they are today so obviously they had some rendering troubles and flipped the moons texture happens all the time in old games
space,not_removed,makes sense if entire original tapes were erased in error due to film shortages its quite plausible to believe someone made the mistake of simply putting the tape in backwards its kind of funny actually
space,not_removed,well its film so maybe somebody just rolled it up backasswards at some stage
space,not_removed,hi there im the author of the site in your left photo this is entirely my fault i just took a look at the footage from that segment and my copy of the scan of the original film in that segment is reversed i can tell because the leader between film segments contains text that is also reversed ill fix it
space,not_removed,that confirms my guess then the reason i was comparing google moon to apollo footage was to try and demonstrate the consistency of the moon landing data if the apollo footage of the far side of the moon matched the google images of the moon in perfect detail then either someone made a really detailed fake model of the moon which would hence be used to generate all future pictures of the moon for the eyes of the billion people of global society or the apollo footage is of the real moon i just stumbled upon this film reversal by mistake i wonder how long it would have gone unnoticed otherwise haha and also by the way is absolutely amazing i cant imagine the massive amount of work that must go into a project like that
space,not_removed,you can have starquakes too httpsenwikipediaorgwikiquakenaturalphenomenonstarquake the largest recorded starquake was detected on december from the ultracompact stellar corpse magnetar sgr which created a quake equivalent to a on the richter scale the quake which occurred light years from earth released gamma rays equivalent to kw in intensity had it occurred within a distance of light years from earth the quake would have possibly triggered a mass extinction
space,not_removed,earthquakes happen on other planets but they are not called earthquakes it is the name of the planet and then quake like marsquakes mars recently had marsquakes of magnitude they can happen on planets moons and stars anything with a molten or liquid core
space,not_removed,no there are no earthquakes bu moonqaukes have aleady been observed as have marsquakes and other quakes on other bodies
space,not_removed,there are earthquakes on other planets who have liquid coresmantle like structure the strength of them just depends on if we can detect them personally that would be beyond my knowledge
space,not_removed,if there are hurricane winds up to and beyond on saturn then i would say its safe to say that there are most likely super intense quakes on other bodies that are ridiculously dense or odd gravitational forces thrust upon them as well as your standard tectonic plate shenanigans
space,not_removed,does mars have a molten core though
space,not_removed,mars recently had marsquakes of magnitude do you have a source for that to my knowledge we dont have any instrumentation on mars able to detect seismic activity the general consensus is that while mars once had volcanic and seismic activity it is unlikely that anything significant still happens
space,not_removed,thats right i do fucking herb puns now please send help is what it says when mentions how black holes distort time for the lazy it really wasnt worth my time but youre welcome
space,not_removed,youre doing good work sir
space,not_removed,an amazing day for the space industry and human kind alike this is so freaking awesome
space,not_removed,for the shit thats going to happen in the very near future this aint shit what a time to be alive
space,not_removed,i know right i was watching it with my wife because i made her watch it i said you need to watch this because history is being made this is setting the stage for everything that will happen in space in our lifetimes hopefully she didnt seem impressed lol she said wait so there arent even humans on it haha i just laughed at her she does not get it
space,not_removed,cosmos both the new and original race to space bbc miniseriesdocumentary when we left earth
space,not_removed,i envy everything about this picture the camera equipment the view and of course the car
space,not_removed,cool pic would u mind telling us a bit of how this kind of shot was taken im new into photography and when i see a cool photo i always would love if the author could explain what cam settings post work was done cheers
space,not_removed,nbsp im a bot please report any issue on httpsgithubcomopenseadragonredditbotissues
space,not_removed,is that a tesla
space,not_removed,yeah id love to sometimes i dont want to bore people with the details so im glad youre interested i took this with a canon mk and a rokinon lens i think exposure iso and the story is i was shooting down this long road in the middle of nowhere and getting the stars above the road while the camera was shooting i looked up and traced the milky way down to the horizon i saw it was right above the car so i turned the camera around set a timer and sat in front of the car there was a little bit of flair from a nearby light source but otherwise i like how it turned out
space,not_removed,yes that looks like a model s
space,not_removed,is it just the single exposure or are there multiple layers
space,not_removed,what kind of post work did you do i thought milky way shots took multiple exposures stitched together not just a twenty second single shot
space,not_removed,i thought about doing two exposures but i decided to keep it in one i could have made it a lot cleaner looking with two but i feel better about having only one for some reason
space,not_removed,because youre firing these out of a gun they would need to be resistant to high gees and theyd presumably lack their own propulsion system if you think of conventional systems as a giant rocket that fires small probes out into space youre pretty close except a rocket sends gases out the back over time and a gun does it all at once
space,not_removed,a billon random probes would be next to useless it would be like randomly shooting a shotgun from your rooftop and hoping to hit a duck space is big
space,not_removed,the main problem i see is powering the probes even if theyre relatively slow moving theyll quickly reach a point where solar power isnt sufficient but since theyre slow moving a normal battery might not last long enough to get somewhere that readings would be useful and using something like an rtg like voyager and other large probes have isnt cheap
space,not_removed,depending on what the probes purpose was true if you had each one broadcasting a signal anything or anyone likely to pick up on such a signal would have an easier time receiving it if you had a wide dispersion pattern of broadcast units
space,not_removed,what is the purpose its multiple times easier to send a trillion stronger signals from earth a probe a billion kms from earth isnt any closer to wherever than we are standing on earthother than a few hours of speed of light in a particular direction the nearest star system is about light years away being closer after a couple decades is hardly worth the resources
space,not_removed,im no astronaut but the nasa website has all the details you need to apply as an astronaut if youre not american then your own countrys space program should have the same info available basically the two main requirements are that you will require a science degree preferably engineering or medical and on top of that having pilot experience is a big bonus the rest is just carry on top the more experience you have in problem solving jobs the better your odds are
space,not_removed,i used to work in aviation and i have a general insight of the prerequisites that would qualify someone for the space program i just want to know what would give that person that extra edge to secure that seat more of the psychological aspects i guess
space,not_removed,look up smarter every day on youtube the guys an engineerscience communicator who is trying for the space program
space,not_removed,yes thank you
space,not_removed,huge congratulations to spacex and heres to seeing the same booster fly again and again gwynne shotwell mentioned in the webcast that the ultimate aim is to have a turnaround time on the boosters this is the first step to getting there
space,not_removed,credit where credit is due ses has some massive balls to be willing to fly on the first reusable booster they have stood by spacex through thick and thin and i hope their foresight to take risks to advance the industry hopefully pays dividend
space,not_removed,years in the making and they finally did it they launched a previously used rocket and landed it thats a reusable rocket holy crap
space,not_removed,one of the grid fins was a tad on fire after reentry burn i know they get hot but ive never noticed one slightly aflame after reentry burn ended looking forward to the landing video
space,not_removed,elon speaking after the landing
space,not_removed,what a dramatic interruption of the live feed from the drone ship not gonna lie i teared up when it cut back in and there was the cheeky little bastard as a person who remanufactures locomotive engines for a living i so desperately want to know how what percentage of the rocket was reused how much teardown was necessary and how much inspection was done on the little bugger
space,not_removed,i cant wait until this becomes so routine that we arent even excited by it anymore
space,not_removed,congrats to spacex this means everyone is going to throw money at repeating spacexs feat more funding more competition its the perfect storm for another space race
space,not_removed,that was awesome why do i get so emotional when i watch this stuff
space,not_removed,the livestream video source for anyone interested this is such an incredible moment for spaceflight and humanity reusable spaceships muthaflippa
space,not_removed,today is a day that our grandchildren will be reading about in history textbooks and we were here to witness it happen live spacex has proven every single skeptic wrong i am so incredibly honored to be have watched spacex make history time and time again and i cant wait to watch even more
space,not_removed,congratulations to spacex this is huge for not only them but also for advancing the next stages of space flight were witnessing history here
space,not_removed,looked almost like the grid fin was catching fire due to the way the sun shone on it during the descent looked kinda alarming but beautiful nonetheless what an amazing piece of technology
space,not_removed,i just feel happy to be alive right now history in the making
space,not_removed,for reference a spacex engineer once equated landing a falcon to launching a pencil over the and then landing it on the eraser
space,not_removed,the drone ship name sounds like something straight out of banks culture series
space,not_removed,caught the stream great feeling seeing it go off without a hitch and that ladies and gentlemen is the first instance of this whole reusable rocket actually being exploited i was utterly amazed the first time i saw a rocket land i assumed it was just the first half of the video being played in reverse and then it hit me whoa then i saw it in use it delivered a payload and then came back down that ones going to be in a museum and this one this was finally got reused one rocket engine two launches fuck yeah space just got a little cheaper and a little more accessible elon musk is now a usedrocket salesman
space,not_removed,this isnt much of a contributing comment but holy shit this is historic for space exploration
space,not_removed,three more times and they get a free frozen yogurt
space,not_removed,dont forget that until very recently in our history the most advanced form of human transport was riding a horse i got chills watching this historic moment live incredible achievement congratulations to everyone at spacex who made this a reality
space,not_removed,so whats next keep using it until something goes wrong that seem to be the way to get the most science out of it
space,not_removed,so they saved themselves something like million since they didnt have to build a rocket from scratch
space,not_removed,congratulations spacex keep continuing to make
space,not_removed,combat pilots paint various planes and structure silhouettes to keep track of what theyve destroyed on missions spacex should start painting little silhouettes for each satteliteprobedragon each stage is responsible for lifting
space,not_removed,ahh remember the days when landing the first rocket was big news
space,not_removed,spacex is so cool im a man and still want to have elon musks babies
space,not_removed,the stream didnt show the actual landing though it cut to the reporters and then cut back to the landed first stage but hey they did it
space,not_removed,as elon musk said on the webcast a good comparison of current rockets would be if you took an airplane and threw it out after every flight this is huge and should hopefully lead to a large reduction in the cost of access to space reusing even the first stage is still saving tens of millions of dollars that was previously thrown into the ocean go spacex blue origin nasa and everyone else that is pushing to advance rocketry
space,not_removed,stupid question maybe but why is of course i still love you jammed in there is that the name of something or did elon musk just sent a secret message to all his previous love interests
space,not_removed,there is some good in this world and its worth fighting for
space,not_removed,imagine the fucking hype when they launch and depart for mars my god il be loosing my shit
space,not_removed,i cant imagine how good elon musk must feel just now incredible to witness this turning point in the history of space travel
space,not_removed,spacex aint no fucking joke that was absolutely amazing
space,not_removed,i started panicking when the screen went black prior to landing then whooped for joy when the landing was confirmed spacex continue to lead the way
space,not_removed,its not often you have a moment where you realize oh yeah thatll be in the smithsonian for sure today is one of those days
space,not_removed,there are people alive today who were also alive before the wright brothers made their first flight in less than a single lifetime weve gone from people thinking flight was impossible to taking reusable rockets into outer space
space,not_removed,damn ive lived in the canaveral area all my life and ive only gone to kennedy for two launches the first time they managed to land a rocket and this launch when you see launches your entire life it doesnt really hit you on how much of a big deal it actually is to accomplish something like this its actually pretty crazy
space,not_removed,i was actually cheering this on never been so proud to be a geek engineering at its finest too bad the video feed gave out on both the craft and the drone ship would have been even more energized certainly an amazing day in spaceflight congrats to spacex and mankind this is history edit spelling
space,not_removed,congrats to my husband and the rest of the spacex team big day for the space industry
space,not_removed,im amazed at that they only landed their first booster months ago this is extreamely increadible the history of spaceflight chnaged today one step closer to mars the moon and the rest of the solar system god speed falcon may we see you do this many a more times
space,not_removed,watching elon musk getting a bit emotional is way worth my sleepless night congrats humans
space,not_removed,he wants to do a reflight in hours this man is going down in history so hard
space,not_removed,amazing feat too bad they dont get the publicity they deserve anymore funny when you do things right most dont notice
space,not_removed,so while im happy to see them succeed i have to ask whats the difference between this and what nasa did with the shuttle boosters and the shuttle itself
space,not_removed,im glad i was here to witness the journey leading up to this historic moment this will definitely change spaceflight for years to come ever since the first landing spacex did every next one was becoming more and more mundane even commonplace in a sense and i hope reuse will go through that as well that will be a mark of true success that years ago was thought impossible great job spacex and everyone involved
space,not_removed,so my space knowledge is only really good for a round trip to duna can someone do a for me as to why this is so ground breaking in comparison to the space shuttle im not trying to down talk this achievement i just genuinely dont understand
space,not_removed,pub quiz in what year did spacex launch return a previously used orbital rocket for the first time me i fucking know this one
space,not_removed,we are witnessing a moment that could and should go down in the history books as a major advancement in human space travel best behaviour everyone
space,not_removed,great day for humankind and space exploration as a whole congrats to all those involved
space,not_removed,honest question how is this different from previous landings
space,not_removed,imagine how musk must feel seeing that cant say he hasnt earned it
space,not_removed,we fucking made a rocket and then used the rocket again what the fuck like it hasnt even been years since we went to space which in the big picture is a hair of time look out aliens
space,not_removed,god damn what an amazing achievement this has been a great day for all of mankind as were a few steps closer to cheap transportation to orbit
space,not_removed,now that you can get a used rocket car fax has a new market before you buy a used rocket check the rocket fax
space,not_removed,major accomplishment is hours old mention on cnn or bbc
space,not_removed,i cant wait till this becomes boring oclock super dragon to mars is now loading passengers with a red tick please approve the gate now
space,not_removed,this is why i think elon is the new world leader
space,not_removed,sad that the video freezed but so awesome to see this really happening a great day for space flight a wonderful moment for the spacex team and another step towards a multiplanetary human species
space,not_removed,pack your shit guys we are done here we going to the mars
space,not_removed,holy hell this was amazing ive never been this excited about a launch ever this is going down in history folks and we were lucky enough to witness it truly a next stage for space travel elon must be ecstatic right now
space,not_removed,my cousin works for spacex good to see his work pay off
space,not_removed,congrats to elon and the whole spacex team this is nothing short of historic an incredible vindication of their belief that they could in fact do what was thought to be almost impossible
space,not_removed,elon musk is a hero and will be in the biblical texts of the future when were living all around the solar system
space,not_removed,we had an impromptu viewing party at work many people werent aware of what spacex has been up to so it was an awesome occasion
space,not_removed,does anyone have the part of the stream where elon smiles or any part of it lol i didnt even know about this
space,not_removed,cant wait for the landing video and the drone footage
space,not_removed,as someone who doesnt follow this stuff very closely its shocking how many first ever posts get made my gut reaction is to find it annoying but when i really stop the think about it i realize how special it is what these companies are achieving
space,not_removed,this is it humanzzz heading toward the next step for our civilization
space,not_removed,this is the stuff people have dreamt of the reusable rocket is a huge landmark moment for space travel
space,not_removed,i like to think my kids are going to have to answer this question on their high school astronomy exams in years or so
space,not_removed,my favourite is it took years for flat earth to become popular again
space,not_removed,its been said before and im just going to say it again i love the gravitas or lack thereof spacex has put into into its ship names
space,not_removed,i was here when this happened right here incredible
space,not_removed,major congratulations to my crush for the accomplishment this is huge for him and elon musk will only get better and better this is so cool
space,not_removed,i understand that blue origin is developing similar rocket reusability can someone explain the difference between their success with respect to that versus spacexs
space,not_removed,it is now being reported that the fairings were recovered successfully as well with parachutes
space,not_removed,are you guys silly of course he was gonna send it
space,not_removed,doesnt the space shuttle count as a reusable orbital class space ship they reused the solid rocket boosters and the shuttle including its engines this just saves one stage of a three stage rocket
space,not_removed,i watched this from outside my condo in cocoa beach we toured the kennedy space center on tuesday my daughter is almost and loved every minute of it
space,not_removed,saw this launch in person today holy shit felt like i was witnessing a pivotal moment in space travel
space,not_removed,what an amazing moment in space flight history spacex is the future so glad i got to witness this
space,not_removed,i saw it launch today from cocoa beach pretty cool
space,not_removed,im happy that people like elon musk exist i think hes the only one thats working on things to save humanity from its future self
space,not_removed,id do anything just to work at that company doing a degree in international relations politics and german so probably wouldnt be involved in any mechanical operations but just to be in that room friday afternoon with colleague and friends maybe even some champagne that sounds like a place id like to work beats my current job in london
space,not_removed,im very curious i dont know much about space x why is this so momentous and what are the implications of what just happened edit thanks for the awesome replies i totally underestimated how crazy this is
space,not_removed,just finished the elon musk biography the author noted engineers that said the reused rocket wouldnt work this can now be another chapter in his book they said it couldnt be done then elon got the people to get it done
space,not_removed,i was really hoping the barge name was a reference to iain m banks is that actually confirmed to be the case i see people suggesting so on twitter
space,not_removed,in these grave days finally some bright news that restore my confidence on human civilization
space,not_removed,spacex just made history holy shit this is incredible
space,not_removed,this is why elon has fanboys can you blame us
space,not_removed,im on a boat returning from the launch we are down here for my grandmas funeral her husband was a challenger engineer and its an amazing trip ute to their family to see how far space travel has progressed what an amazing experience
space,not_removed,historic up there with the moon landing changes space flight as we know it and i witnessed itman what i would pay to see it in person
space,not_removed,this is the kind of shit we need right fucking now progress in space exploration ps i really want to be a major contributor to stuff like this in every way i can
space,not_removed,this post could achieve orbit by how fast its gonna rocket to the front page
space,not_removed,this is a much bigger milestone than people realize someday that falcon will be in a museum
space,not_removed,great news from spacex and a great day for spaceflight and human exploration years from now when a trip to the moon or mars wont cost millions or billions of dollars we will look back to this day and see what made it all possible
space,not_removed,damn i missed watching the flight live because i was stuck in beltway traffic glad they made it though go spacex
space,not_removed,the advantage of reusable rockets is economical savings but im curious how much they actually saved from this reflight other than proving technical feasibility
space,not_removed,honestly at this point id be really disappointed if elon musk doesnt reveal himself to be an alien anytime in the future hahaha kidding aside i never thought id feel rather emotional during those minutes or so between falcon lift off and safe landing for the mission i was truly a bit tearyeyed amazing job humans another history made and im just so damn glad i was able to witness it
space,not_removed,really nice article that estimates the cost savings for reusing rockets advertised price saved per launch which they may pass on only a portion of savings thus making them more money awesome
space,not_removed,im just so amazed by all of this its so damn cool i cannot wait to see how this progresses
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,stupid question how is this different from the other times theyve landed stage did the rocket go further this time or something edit first time being used for the second time awesome cheers for the replies
space,not_removed,well congratulations to them incredible accomplishment
space,not_removed,its a done deal elon will be getting us to mars
space,not_removed,im so glad i got to watch this happen from just across the river absolutely astounding
space,not_removed,why is it so difficult to find how much would of payload cost if spacex reusable stage rocket makes it more than times up and down in compare with the competition is it like or more like
space,not_removed,wow thats phenomenal kudos to them the new space race has begun
space,not_removed,i was at the launch but they didnt get spacex feed fed in til after lift off on the loudspeakers no countdown or anything it was awesome to hear how excited they were when we finally heard it though this was also my first full launch experience and im glad i decided to go my dad tried previous times and they all got scrubbed
space,not_removed,i assume china will be hacking all of spacex technical files how any minute now
space,not_removed,this is truly amazing and awesome for the private space industry
space,not_removed,i have nothing but respect and lets face it sheer awe for this both literally and figuratively astronomical achievement but i simply must put this thought into words there must one hell of a story behind the name of that boat one hell of a message i cant help but wonder whether or not whoever it was for ever got it i hope they did
space,not_removed,does anyone else get emotional watching these spacex vids its so awesome to see and hear the crowd get so into it and to see everyones hard work pay off
space,not_removed,congratulation seems like the privatisation of the space might finally be happening what will this mean for esa and ariane are they in panic mode or are they so far mostly competing in different markets
space,not_removed,does the space shuttle not count as a rocket or is there some special definition of rocket that i dont klnow about
space,not_removed,is someone at spacex a fan of iain m banks by any chance
space,not_removed,whoever names these barges i applaud him man i miss iains writing
space,not_removed,this is amazing imagine using these rockets to steadily deliver materials into geostationary orbit and assembling colony starships in the future wow
space,not_removed,of course i still love you isnt that a ship in the culture series player of games if im not wrong
space,not_removed,how are these rockets different from the solid rocket boosters the space shuttle used i mean other than the fact that they land themselves
space,not_removed,at first read i thought the poster was dictating the headline and was interrupted by his suspicious girlfriend
space,not_removed,tween in rolls eyes we always land the same way lame
space,not_removed,heres a story that should be all over the news instead of all the negativity spread out by the media outlets
space,not_removed,we will look back on this years from now and scoff and say we couldnt even figure out how to use the same rocket more than once ppssshh
space,not_removed,so how much money did they just save by reusing the first stage
space,not_removed,i shed a tear aerospace history was made and im glad i was able to watch it live spacex is going to get us to mars
space,not_removed,thank god there are more than elon musks but less than at elon musk we live in the present at elon musk we live years in the future at greater than elon musks complete obliteration by future wars
space,not_removed,i was at the hawthorne airport today and a bunch of spacex people were in the restaurant cheering wondered what was going on
space,not_removed,falcon why not falcon or phil kenn sebben anyway congrats spacex reusable equipment for space travel the next step to implementing a travel scheme to a new orbital station the moon or some livable space up in outer space so after that whats next for spacex increased space for more passengers and luggage new sustained livable space station moon base damn the future is definitely here once more
space,not_removed,my first thought after seeing this was how many total hackersspies does china have involved in getting this new data from space x
space,not_removed,thank you free market for innovation yet again
space,not_removed,this is so fucking huge god damn i am excited to see what the future holds for them if only the rest of the world would get on the same page of sustainability and advancement
space,not_removed,i called my three children in and told them this is history watch the moment the world changes it was amazing
space,not_removed,this was so disappointing yet amazing at the same time internet connections at the kennedy space center press site have gone down apologies for the break in video coverage falcon has landed
space,not_removed,and north korea can barely launch a missile successfully or predictably awesome love our country
space,not_removed,now if they can reuse it say ten more times then they will have proven that these things can and will last for many launches
space,not_removed,this crap makes me proud to be an american nice work spacex team to infinity and beyond
space,not_removed,congrats to everyone involved can anyone here give me a rough swag at actually how much of the rocket was reused
space,not_removed,i think this booster will be donated and not reused again as there are more modern versions in production already i believe
space,not_removed,elon is known to be sentimental about progress achievements his first ever that landed is on display at their headquarters in hawthorne i would imagine the significance of this one will be too great to allow it to be lost in a future flight it needs to sit next to the first one that landed i fucking love spacex
space,not_removed,elon just tweeted this too
space,not_removed,it took almost a full year to do it with this booster so they have a ways to go but luckily thats not an engineering problem thats a servicing and infrastructure problem which can be solved if you throw money at it
space,not_removed,one of the components to cheaper space access is more regular launches wasnt the space shuttle supposed to be cheaper with the assumption that there would be more regular flights than what was actually done
space,not_removed,this is an older rocket and from my understanding was only ever really meant to fly times the goal is for the block version to be able to fly times but it will probably be a couple of years before we know if that can be a reality the goal is to build rockets that will land and relaunch within hours in the future the its will need to have a pretty quick turnaround time for large mars missions to set off within the prime launch window i dont think it has ever been stated that it was a goal for the falcon though
space,not_removed,in the postlaunch press conference elon musk said that it is possible with the fully reusable bfr the lower stage of the interplanetary transport system for mars they can achieve a flight rate of once per hour
space,not_removed,theyre going to get some parts of that booster to decorate their headquarters thats already a huge benefit
space,not_removed,the cost savings spacex offers will mean more satellites for ses without spending a dime more that is huge cant find anything on the cost of ses satellites but the facebook one was million so lets say a satellite is if you launched with arianne or atlas rockets you are paying per launch per satellite that is per satellite in orbit with spacex you are paying for launch and per satellite you can put two satellites in orbit for the same amount of money as any spacex competitor now say spacex drops down from to you are now putting satellites for the cost of previous spacex launches the price will just keep improving ses is going to get preferential scheduling by partnering for these early flights
space,not_removed,im sure insurance helped their confidence a little
space,not_removed,years is really not long like from scratch to this amazing work
space,not_removed,i feel like the world at large isnt appreciating the enormity enormousness of this enterprise beyond geekier circles and those directly concerned this is an extraordinary development in the history of space flight
space,not_removed,that thing went to space and came back and then did it again this is amazing congrats to spacex on making history
space,not_removed,its wonderful on one hand it makes me sad that it took a private company to care enough about space to make it happen on the other hand it makes me happy that it took a private company to care enough about space to make it happen
space,not_removed,even better than that musk said his next goal for spacex is to use a rocket twice within hours imagine if they can pull that off
space,not_removed,spacex successfully launching and landing the first reusable rocket telsa likely to ship the car they have been working hard to create for years the beginning of a new neural net venture is looking to be a really good year for elon musk
space,not_removed,imagine something the size of the saturn v but all modern technology and reusable this can change a lot of things when it comes to just getting payloads into space
space,not_removed,hopefully these quick advances might lead to us either overcoming or surviving climate change it took us only or so years to get from first flight to landing on the moon and even less time from then to landing rovers on mars building a vehicle that left the solar system and then even less time to landing on tiny asteroids and building reusable rockets capable of bringing a hundred people to mars thats just air and space technology
space,not_removed,elon said in the press conference afterwards that they will be replacing the current aluminium grid fins with titanium ones to prevent this issue
space,not_removed,nothing could stop me smiling right now this is fantastic
space,not_removed,when i first found out they were trying to do this i was like yh thatll never work eating my words for breakfast right now
space,not_removed,youre absolutely correct this isnt just an historic date for space flight but its a historic day for all mankind this is huge step by step to the stars
space,not_removed,i mean its awesome and all but i dont think itll really be textbook history worthy the space shuttle was the first partially reusable orbital launch vehicle this is just the first partially reusable olv to land vertically which is neat due to the simplicity of the design and massive cost savings but ultimately not as huge technologically as the shuttle was years ago its more of the small step variety than the giant leap
space,not_removed,on the live stream they cut in early and you could see how happy he was
space,not_removed,he can hardly contain his excitement this is awesome
space,not_removed,heres the celebration immediately after video is restored from the landing
space,not_removed,he definitely seemed very emotional beyond happy actually truly moved by the achievement loved it
space,not_removed,they reused everything major on the first stage theyve said it was the same engines obviously the same structuretanks as far as teardown being that this was the first reuse they toredown as much as humanly possible not necessary but because its the absolute first time they took every precaution you can bet every single dang bolt was inspected we dont know the exact details for instance did they reuse the interstage or not as its composite not metal but thats a very small part of the first stage
space,not_removed,a few parts are singleuse legs ablative paint that sort of thing the designs have used nonexplosive pushers instead of traditional explosive bolts so those dont need replacing either all the plumbing and pumps should be reused as well as the engines and it didnt get a wholesale repaint because we could see it was grubby still
space,not_removed,this is just the start its where the rockets will take us that is going to be exciting pretty soon
space,not_removed,i have lived most my life in brevard watching shuttles and rockets go up shuttles did get very routine and i missed them so much when they were gone im absolutely thrilled my got to see this today and will get to grow up with it
space,not_removed,competition has always spurred innovation rather than the competition being nuclear weapons or tanks its the sheer love of adventure and taking our species to the next level
space,not_removed,because its history being made
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,because its rare that people in history realise that theyre living in a moment that will be in the history books this is definitely one of them
space,not_removed,youre not the only one in tears this is a huge moment for the whole human race
space,not_removed,im in orlando and could watch it from here i had full on goose bumps standing outside in degree weather weird how not many people get excited like they did for the shuttle i was on the sidewalk in my neighborhood staring at the sky and people kept driving by me and looking at me like i was crazy when the shuttles would go up people would turn off into a parking lot so they wouldnt miss it
space,not_removed,there is something viscerally emotional about a rocket launch its built into our dna theres no other explanation
space,not_removed,launch is at
space,not_removed,how is it that we dont have footage of the landing this time when weve had it before you dont need a link to record video
space,not_removed,hopefully our history classes are a little more in depth in the future because if its at this pace im thinking they wont be reading about it
space,not_removed,sure same way they read about the first fullflow staged combustion engine nowadays
space,not_removed,someday theyll be asking us what do you mean rockets was once a one time use
space,not_removed,no it was actually burning thats how fast it is going at that part and why they need the reentry burn to slow down before hitting too much air
space,not_removed,im pretty sure it was actually smoldering because of reentry p
space,not_removed,i thought it looked like paint being peeled off from reentry it was definitely something because the camera was getting covered my pieces of something
space,not_removed,im pretty sure thats actually ablative paint
space,not_removed,kind of disappointed that wasnt a demonstration of someone launching a pencil over the empire state building and landing it on the eraser
space,not_removed,thats not a great analogy because pencils cant steer or slow themselves down also they dont have landing legs
space,not_removed,i think that was tim urban from waitbutwhycom
space,not_removed,thanks for the visual the last stage in landing just read the instructions literally with the quotes can someone explain that given the other stage names could this be a little rocket scientist joke perhaps like after landing the thing an enormous feat they only just bothered to read the instructions on how to build it similar to ikea furniture
space,not_removed,because it is there is of course i still love you in the atlantic and just read the instructions on the pacific
space,not_removed,because it is something out of banks culture series
space,not_removed,it is thats what theyre named after
space,not_removed,as someone not subscibed to rspace the title confused the hell out of me
space,not_removed,come on down to crazy elons discount rockets we have so many rockets we cant put them all in our hanger we are practically just giving them away bad credit no credit no problem all our rockets go through a rigorous hundred point inspection and a certified ready to fly so come on down to rocket road in hawthorne ca just look for the big rocket out front
space,not_removed,they serve free frozen yogurt at the hawthorne campus not sure about the other spacex locations
space,not_removed,spacex already provides free froyo to employees
space,not_removed,but the yogurt is also cursed
space,not_removed,weve had massive seafaring vessels for thousands of years horses are old tech but this is still amazing
space,not_removed,define very recently
space,not_removed,theres still places in the world where a bicycle is the best mode of transit and yet others where no really just walk
space,not_removed,the kerbal way
space,not_removed,keep iterating and keep doing it until you can literally launch a rocket multiple times in one day these early reuse experiments will inform how they build the rockets from the ground up
space,not_removed,no they spent month checking and refurbishing the booster it took that long cause it was the first booster to ever be reused they want to get the refurbishing down to a week though
space,not_removed,thats such an awesome gif
space,not_removed,like a silhouette of a dragon capsule or silhouette of a generic satellite for whatever mission they deliver
space,not_removed,phallcon silhouettes with two clouds of smoke at the bottom
space,not_removed,get in line you
space,not_removed,once they can get to the footage on the donreship we will have landing video
space,not_removed,they mentioned this they dont have lineofsight to the barge and the rocket exhaust blocks shakes the crap out of the barge to their communication satellite e science
space,not_removed,the name comes from httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofspacecraftinthecultureseries a lot of them are chuckle worthy my favorites are the warship names
space,not_removed,thats the name of the drone ship the rocket lands on its from iain m banks culture novels
space,not_removed,exodus is a strong word but yes it is all working towards building a colony on mars
space,not_removed,really hope im alive for this
space,not_removed,im guessing that hes getting laid tonight
space,not_removed,since it was the satellite feed and not the actual footage that was killed because of the turbulence well hopefully see the actual landing soon
space,not_removed,the shuttle while it could be refurbished needed extensive maintenance before it could be reused some at nasa claimed it was more of a rebuildable spacecraft than a reusable one since they had to do things like inspect every single tile the boosters parachuted into water so they had to be repaired the shuttles initial promise of providing cheap and reliable access to space turned out to be false the is a vtol rocket so it lands in almost the same state it launched in refurbishments involve inspection and new paint and fuel
space,not_removed,the booster parachutes back to earth and drops in the ocean spacexs rockets are controlled landings
space,not_removed,fundamentally there is no difference but the shuttle had some problems it was barely reusable the boosters were fished out of the ocean and mostly rebuilt the tiles needed replacing frequently the tank was disposable and the engines were completely stripped and many parts replaced all of this came at a huge weight penalty which meant shuttle missions were a fair bit more expensive than disposable the reused falcon likely had a lot of work and checking and i think at least one new engine but the intent is to do some comparatively basic servicing and put it back into service looked at another way the falcon isnt as reusable the second stage is disposable and intended to be so for quite some time another difference is that the falcon is autonomous it lands itself and it comes in a lot more slowly the first stage is never moving at even close to orbital speed so there is a lot less stress on it basically this is the infancy of a system which can in principle at least fly land attach a fuel hose out and lift another stage onto it with a crane then fly again the refinements necessary to do this safely might not ever get to the falcon but its much more vehiclelike and less disposablestickofboomlike than anything that came before it
space,not_removed,sure pops sure
space,not_removed,im not positive but i think they have been using different orbital rockets each launch this is the first time they reused an original class rocket that has been launched before and relanded that was there goal to reuse rockets to save money
space,not_removed,this was a reused booster so it was the second time this particular stage stuck the landing
space,not_removed,the others are correct theyve been landing boosters but never reflown one until today
space,not_removed,it was that the leader of mars would be called elon
space,not_removed,here it starts about right now i think later spacex is going to cut intro music off so video will be shorter but right now it is found on around that time
space,not_removed,theyre from ian m bankss culture series space opera if youre into that it is excellent scifi
space,not_removed,new shepard goes up and comes down falcon goes up and away very fast after delivering another stage towards orbit and has to deal with a supersonic reentry into the atmosphere
space,not_removed,blue origin as of now anyway doesnt put things into orbit it shoots stuff up real high and you immediately fall back down so youre in space and feeling the free fall nogravity for about minutes the rocket hits a couple thousand miles per hour going into orbit is similar at first you go up a similar distance at a similar speed but then spacex or other orbits rockets turn sideways and go real fast the space station goes about mph if it were only going mph like blue origins new shepherd then it too would be hitting the earth in a few minutes super fun comic to explain
space,not_removed,kind of it basically had to be rebuilt between launches
space,not_removed,the standard metaphor is imagine every airplane could only be flown once then you have to destroy it imagine the cost of buying an airline ticket it would be insane that is where we were with rockets use once and trash until today space shuttle didnt count because a majority of it was crazy expensive to reuse nearly the cost of a new one
space,not_removed,yes elon is a big iain m banks fan
space,not_removed,what else would it be haha
space,not_removed,at what age level are you if youre yet to go to college or university think about going for an aerospace engineering degree if you arent thinking about it already the space business is growing fast right now and by the time youre in the workforce it will be even larger and hopefully involve people close to getting to mars if youre already at college or university studying for another degree do not worry space travel is a subject that requires people from all fields to come together although the building of the vehicles are done mostly by engineers almost every science degree there is can get you a job in some aspect of space exploration even if youre not a science major there are still opportunities so keep your eyes open
space,not_removed,elon mentioned in the press conference that this stage would remain at the cape of course the other ones will too but will spend a fair bit of time flying over the cape
space,not_removed,this is the first flight of a first stage that has already flown before this one was flown last year so this is the first reuse
space,not_removed,this one has landed before they reused it thats never been done before
space,not_removed,they launched it landed it launched it again and landed it
space,not_removed,million a launch is the number i see in a few places onces reusability becomes a regular thing probably starting in later for now its listed as million but as the rd capital costs goes down the price will drop over the years the max a can launch and be recovered is around kg for gto and at least kg for leo probably can do more but with this data we can see that its currently for gto and it maybe down to for gto
space,not_removed,i am a chinese and to my disappointment，cnsa is not even trying to develop retropropulsive landing vehicle instead，they are developing a parachute landing system and claim it is better than spacexs
space,not_removed,spacex computers are air gaped for exactly this reason
space,not_removed,i definitely do i got teary eyed when they landed their first booster and have been super excited and celebrating all night after today but then again im a huge space buff and amateur astronomer
space,not_removed,iirc，the head of esa claimed that it is better to massively produce expendable rockets
space,not_removed,after every launch the engines of the space shuttle were swapped out and worked on and moved around between shuttles with the falcon rocket they tested all of the engines and used all of the same engines in place
space,not_removed,why construct them in geo？
space,not_removed,have you watched elons making humans an interplanetary species presentation
space,not_removed,correct elon is a fan of the series and uses the names at spacex the other drone ship is called just read the instructions and he has suggested that the first mars spaceship may be called heart of gold
space,not_removed,the srbs needed a lot of refurbishment before they could fly again they still land quite hard and salt water is not a good environment for a rocket they were completely disassembled as part of the refurbishment and its thought it actually cost more than simply building new ones every time however theres a lot to learn from recovered flown hardware spacexs aim to make reflight of a booster so routine it can be done within hours
space,not_removed,the solid rocket boosters were steel pipes filled with rubber stacked on top of eachother and then set on fire they could work with no moving parts the nozzle did move to aid with steering but the booster could produce full thrust without moving it once lit there was no way to stop it the rocket would continue burning at full power until running out of fuel sometimes pieces of them would survive crashing into the ocean and could be reused after being disassembled and cleaned the falcon burns liquid oxygen and kerosene it has complicated plumbing and moving parts the heart of the rocket is a horsepower turbopump that sprays fuel and oxygen into the main combustion chamber of them actually one for each of the merlin engines it can be throttled down stopped and restarted the falcon also has a reaction control system rcs which enables it to maneuver outside the atmosphere tanks of pressurized nitrogen spray cold gas out the side of the rocket to make it pitchrollyaw
space,not_removed,for now they are doing more tests on every booster than they will in the future once theyve figured out how to optimize the maintenance procedures the price will drop and then stabilize at what will become normal for them once they hit their rhythm this one was offered to the customer at off the goal is an eventual discount to the customer we know the full rocket can be purchased for and it was announced at a press conference that the first stage was almost threequarters of the cost of the rocket that would figure the first stage at million but how much less is unknown outside spacex for the moment not even spacex knows how much they will eventually save theyll have to look at the final maintenance expense but theyve not yet finished writing the maintenance procedure
space,not_removed,remember that in wernher von brauns book the mars project the president of mars is known as the elon of mars so looks like we will have more elons
space,not_removed,you notice steve jobs passed away before elon makes his biggest impact
space,not_removed,because it has engines in the first core
space,not_removed,it has engines whats next is that they continue to refine the process until they can launch the same rocket multiple times in a day with no worry then apply that to the its
space,not_removed,didja get that thing i sentya
space,not_removed,even if they do have spies feeding them everything its not like they could start replicating what spacex is doing
space,not_removed,im pretty sure elon would welcome competition from china as it will accelerate our progress to mars
space,not_removed,if i just told my dad i was the first person ever to reuse a launch vehicle successfully that is what hed say to me
space,not_removed,they probably will not attempt that yet these early reuse experiments are more about figuring out what needs to be fixed in terms of reusability all of the results and postlaunch inspections let them know what parts are the weak points and then they address that in subsequent rockets it is already proven that it will work they just need to figure out how to do it there is nothing stopping them there isnt some magic x factor that will appear either a rocket can be launched multiple times or it cant and they already proved it can
space,not_removed,i dont know if theyve tested cores to destruction but they have tested multiple cores with ten or more full duration burns on their test rig
space,not_removed,and youll be there when that happens with the next obvious step said as a negative
space,not_removed,wait till we get to see the space x its heart of gold
space,not_removed,it belongs in a museum
space,not_removed,i heard that ses the company theyre launching for will get a few pieces of the booster for their boardroom hopefully smaller boardroomsized pieces
space,not_removed,elon just said in the press conference hes going to present it as a gift to the cape if they want it
space,not_removed,there are actually more modern versions planned this one is block they will soon be flying block and block is supposed to fly by the end of the year block is supposed to be rapidly reusable and is planned to be the final major revision to the rocket incidentally they plan to launch all crewed missions from block rockets
space,not_removed,they said theyre giving at least a part of it to ses
space,not_removed,you know who else was sentimental about achievements yeah voldemort just saying youve been warned
space,not_removed,it took months actually but the launch was delayed because of the explosion
space,not_removed,cant make a baby in month by using women
space,not_removed,i want it to fly a third time
space,not_removed,sat costs far outweigh launch costs its closer to half a billion for a commercial comm sat which is part of the reason there hasnt been as much pressure to reduce launch costs
space,not_removed,incoming dumb question why does facebook need a satelite
space,not_removed,wasnt the facebook one like
space,not_removed,also probably a pretty steep discount even past the savings of a cheaper rocket
space,not_removed,one of my favorite holy shit historical facts is that it took years from the wright brothers first flight till landing on the moon
space,not_removed,slow down tiger spacex didnt invent orbital rocketry
space,not_removed,this begs the question why didnt nasa kind of a serious question
space,not_removed,although space x as an entity was built from scratch the company basically is run by exnasa employees so a lot of the ideas and technology was already readily available to space x regardless this is huge and i am very excited for the coming decades of space travel
space,not_removed,it helps them see the enormousness when i ask them does han solo burn the millemium falcon after each trip it makes them see how critical this step is
space,not_removed,as one of the less well informed masses speaking for some of us perhaps i knew they had been doing these incredible feats of landing their rockets vertically after takeoff for a while as such i was not aware theyd never reused one before i assumed theyd been doing this all along to some extent
space,not_removed,extraordinary development in the history of space flight and an even more extraordinary leap for mankind
space,not_removed,enormousness enormity is for things which are both enormous and terrible
space,not_removed,this is an extraordinary development in the history of humanity
space,not_removed,its going to be the private companies citizens that carry the politiciansnations who refuse to innovate and think ahead
space,not_removed,im confident they will they have to if their plan to get to mars is still launching stuff every day for orbital assembly and then departure to the red planet
space,not_removed,imagine something the size of the saturn v but all modern technology and reusable sospacexs mars infrastructure
space,not_removed,im just trying to think of all the things i can cheaply put into orbit
space,not_removed,username checks out
space,not_removed,elons goto analogy
space,not_removed,i think we all thought that hell i still cant believe it
space,not_removed,here it is with the bit before he knew the camera was on
space,not_removed,he is a hell of a lot calmer than i would in his position i would be bouncing off the fucking walls
space,not_removed,this is probably on his bucket list
space,not_removed,i suppose once they know which parts consistently need replacing they can mass produce those parts to lower cost and speed up turn around
space,not_removed,a comment by udsbromeister from the launch thread over on rspacex ive been waiting so long for this i interned at while the refurb was going on and boy did give us trouble im so happy to finally see my baby fly edit since people are asking for more info ill give a couple fun problems we ran into trying to upgrade parts from block to block failing to install them three times then giving up and trying and succeeding with a method from block trying to remove parts that werent originally intended to be removable discovering parts on the booster that theoretically didnt exist before it launched so yeah thats fun
space,not_removed,fasteners are generally much lower cost so i would expect that they scrapped any that were removed during teardown unless it was a critical fastener with an inflated cost
space,not_removed,based on the dirtiness in this it looks like they reused the interstage too
space,not_removed,i really think that was a bit of showmanship on the part of spacex im sure they could have cleaned it to a shine but i think they wanted to say look were gonna fire this thing up again
space,not_removed,my understanding is the upcoming block version will be able to reuse the landing legs
space,not_removed,this enables real space stations this means we can put literally tons of shit up there effectively forget about the spaceindustry other industries in space are about to take off like never before hello space mining
space,not_removed,same here so much of this is marketing as well even when space shuttles were launching during the age of the internet it wasnt anywhere near as exciting sure these are historic launches but ive watched pretty much every single spacex launch since they started the live streams even the ones where they werent landing the first stage meanwhile ill hear about other rocket launches a day or two later musk is a genius in so many different ways
space,not_removed,im jealous there arent very many rocket launches in the midwest
space,not_removed,the love of adventureand the massive ramifications of controlling access to earth orbit
space,not_removed,were living in a pivotal moment in history single cellular life multicelular ocean life terrestrial life single planet multiplanet
space,not_removed,and good history unlike some of the other history weve been witnessing lately fuck yeah for american immigrants edit i mean as someone who supports science and is proud to live in a country that has traditionally recognized the success of its immigrants like elon im happy for some positivity on both fronts big day for all of humanity though
space,not_removed,the only one smoking in the gonogo callout was the surgeon
space,not_removed,it was days years between the actual apollo launch and the release of the movie about the mission it has been days years between the movie about apollo and now we really ought to get back to getting off this planet in a permanent meaningful way httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhcnmthntuo
space,not_removed,apollo as a whole is a goddamn masterpiecebut yes the launch sequence is just gorgeous despite the age of the film of course on this sub i suspect we are preaching to the choir
space,not_removed,me too but partly because there is so much wrong with the launch sequence put in just to drag out the tension source watched just about every apollo launch live
space,not_removed,what really adds to it is that the saturn rockets and this falcon were launched from the same pad
space,not_removed,elon looked close on the webcast
space,not_removed,you have to accept that the shuttle was a more impressive beast i went twice to see it launch both launches scrubbed thats why i committed to never see a spacex launch in person and it was a weird experience you look at it and say that thing cant fly spacex is a more subtle achievement it is a rocket it looks like a rocket and it does what a rocket does just over and over and over
space,not_removed,there is something viscerally emotional about a rocket launch we as a species have found substances that explode releasing energy in amounts almost beyond comprehension we proceeded to take these substances look at the lights in the sky and ride the explosions to look at them up close nothing else quite captures that particular blend of incredible power and overwhelming pride
space,not_removed,well we didnt get live video because of the vibrations from the booster landing however there are spacex gopros onboard the drone ship and they upload the video after within a couple days well have video
space,not_removed,they explained in the webcast that the droneship didnt have any lineofsight connection and was done by satellite uplink the camera stream irritatingly cut out just a minute or so before the actual landing but they will be able to retrieve the footage given that the landing was successful and didnt destroy anything on the droneship
space,not_removed,history curriculum needs to be redone a lot of emphasis is put on then the rest is pretty much a single slide at the end of the teachers notes the emphasis put on different things and the length of time spent on them needs to be adjusted regularly to keep up with the progression of history unfortunately the people in charge dont seem to understand this
space,not_removed,why did the camera shut off right at that point
space,not_removed,the reentry burn isnt actually done for heat reduction due to slowing down actually the main reason for doing a reentry burn is creating a sort of umbrella from the exhaust gases and that way reduce the impact of reentry on the airframe
space,not_removed,consider also that theres a rocket burning not far in front of it id sooner speculate its exhaust gasses than reentry heating
space,not_removed,the camera is covered in a layer of ablative coating as to not be damaged during reentry which is the soot that you see covering it
space,not_removed,someone should start an everymans xprize for that sort of thing
space,not_removed,thats the name of one of their drone ships named after one of iain bankss culture novels
space,not_removed,oh i didnt realize it was intentional cool
space,not_removed,heres a really stupid question ive had for a while is it read like reed or read like red
space,not_removed,just one easy down payment of million
space,not_removed,dont forget that until very recently jumping was the best form of airbased transport
space,not_removed,since when the first train was invented think about that in years weve gone from riding horses to sending rockets to the far corners of the solar system thats absolutely mindboggling
space,not_removed,the factorio method
space,not_removed,hours actually
space,not_removed,good to know thanks
space,not_removed,more like the rocket shakes the shit out of the dish but yes
space,not_removed,i know the next name so much for subtlety
space,not_removed,foretold this reminds me how the word caesar was originally a family name as his companies successes continue to accumulate elon musks name is definitely on the right track to receive such an honor
space,not_removed,all right very interesting im also assuming the payload is much simpler for blue origin as its smaller and the same payload every time whereas spacex will contract with a variety of items
space,not_removed,i dont know i just want it to be true
space,not_removed,there can only be one
space,not_removed,quit bugging me and go clean your room
space,not_removed,it does and thats completely unironic
space,not_removed,the problem with a museum is that the first stage is something like stories high something like you need a pretty big museum to display it heres a httpsistackimgurcomfyvrcjpg of a landed booster with people next to it
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,i found the ezreal main
space,not_removed,or their new boardroom will be inside the booster
space,not_removed,they should get the grid finds or maybe a landing leg without the pistons
space,not_removed,can you think of any parts that might make a good board room table
space,not_removed,bm at its finest
space,not_removed,and i imagine it actually took less than that a lot of the time was spent getting insurance companies to certify it finding a customer and agreeing on a cost for a reused rocket all of that took months
space,not_removed,you can have a birth rate of baby per month tho
space,not_removed,you can make baby per month by using women
space,not_removed,you can assemble a rocket faster with more people though
space,not_removed,that would be awesome but i suspect this one will undergo destructive testing
space,not_removed,if they try a third time its gonna blow up seeing as how some of the pieces will be in the ses board room
space,not_removed,while this is true cheaper launches open the door to manufacture and launch cheaper satellites and have it still be worth it
space,not_removed,to beam out internet so they can expand their user base to remote places with no internet or low income areas which may not be able to afford it partly explained in the link below
space,not_removed,crap million was facebooks portion so adjust for that but the idea is stil the same a launch for spacex instead of for competitors spacex launches costs the same as competitor launches drop to a launch and spacex launches costs the same as competitor launches spacexs pricing is going to be nearly a for difference in the amount of satellites you launch for the same amount of money
space,not_removed,yeah they actually said the spacex gave them an incredible discount
space,not_removed,the real holy shit fact is one of the wright brothers was alive at the same time as neil armstrong now thats some hoty shit
space,not_removed,my favourite is that it took years to go from hey sometimes we get the same sickness when we touch each other to oh we need to wash our hands because of germs
space,not_removed,my favourite is that it took years to get from the iphone to the iphone
space,not_removed,i remember reading that in one of the animorphs books back in like or grade and it blew my fucking mind its one of those little factoids i keep a little bit forward of the back of my mind for when i need a remind yourself how awesome the time youre in is moment
space,not_removed,whoa thats really cool humans are hella industrious its too bad the moon landing has been the peak of that curve since then
space,not_removed,my favorite is that there are people alive in the us today who were teenagers when hawaii and alaska werent states yet they were only added as states in they learned in grade school that there were only states and their flags only had stars its crazy to think that that was only a generation ago the concept of adding new states seems like such an old thing
space,not_removed,yes i can see how crazy this is from not airborne to actually stepping on the moon however those are two different technologies
space,not_removed,imagine experiencing both in your lifetime mind blowing
space,not_removed,and it only took a couple wars and a cold war to progress things along
space,not_removed,i like the fact that one of the wright brothers orville lived through wwii and got to see the evolution of aircraft from gliders all the way to the beginning of rocketry
space,not_removed,they actually started from fire and worked their way up the tech tree
space,not_removed,speed up lion they still had to build everything themselves
space,not_removed,reaching the stars standing on the shoulders of pioneering giants
space,not_removed,because nasa is busy with programs like cassini juno new horizions curiosity jwst mars europa clipper and of course the sls launch platform and the new opportunities such a heavy lifter will provide such as trying to put humans on another planet and return them to earth make no mistake although the ambitions of spacex to put men on mars are admirable the first humans will likely be there as a result of public not private initiative the current goals of nasa and spacex are very different the former being explorational and the latter being necessarily more commercial
space,not_removed,well the millenium falcon break pretty much every laws of physics so it might not be a good reference
space,not_removed,i bet that exact phrase was used to describe the space shuttle at some point
space,not_removed,na everything came down to this no point landing them if they cant be reflown
space,not_removed,i know youre correct but enormousness such an ugly word that i vote we pretend it doesnt exist pedantry be damned
space,not_removed,enormity is for things which are both enormous and terrible primarily yes but not exclusively httpswwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryenormity the quality or state of being huge immensity the inconceivable enormity of the universe a quality of momentous importance or impact the enormity of the decision
space,not_removed,you mam or sir are entirely correct thanks
space,not_removed,too be fair this is personal not normal private no private company would ever fund rd like this musk had to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in his own money to get here he invests spacex money back into rd and doesnt just pay it out as profit to investors anyone invested in spacex is in for the long haul they wont expect returns until after we have a mars base but the returns will be crazy because spacex will be launching satellites daily and have its which will sweep up every nasa spaceflight contract
space,not_removed,i wanna see my turd in the orbit
space,not_removed,me ill gladly go into space
space,not_removed,or change design if possible but yes
space,not_removed,even on terrestrial equipment threaded fasteners are generally considered onetimeuse when you torque a bolt correctly it actually stretches slightly now in practical usage people will reuse hardware but you can pretty much guarantee that any nut or bolt that got removed from this rocket went straight in the dumpster ok maybe an inspection lab first but definitely ended in the dumpster this is especially true of any critical fasteners
space,not_removed,the millennium falcon is another falcon spaceship that looks better dirty
space,not_removed,definitely if they had completely refurbished the booster misinformed folks would dismiss the achievement by saying oh it looks brand new so i guess they just replaced everything so much for reusable the decision not to repaint the rocket was a great way to cement the idea of reusable rocketry to all observers come to think of it this happens in other industries for example recycled paper products are often easily refurbished into likenew condition but the customer wont perceive it as recycled they purposefully drop some of the cosmetic portion of refurbishment so that you can still see tiny bits of colored paper in the recycled product
space,not_removed,well i wouldnt mind spending a week on a space station hotel
space,not_removed,its crazy when you think about it ideally they will be able to put stuff in orbit or farther for just the price of fuel that is so much cheaper than it is currently its ridiculous giant colony ships mining frigates asteroid capture you name it its getting more possible
space,not_removed,space mining seems like musks next industry just to keep the supply chain going for critical materials less than years to fist asteroid landing i bet
space,not_removed,and if there ever are were in big trouble
space,not_removed,make no mistake spacexs plans are about making a colony on mars everything they do is to advance closer to this goal
space,not_removed,single planet multiplanet i damned well hope youre right i hope youre right more than ive hoped for anything else weve been burned too many times before by this kind of prediction remember when we were supposed to have a moon base by now
space,not_removed,id say were approaching a pivotal moment the falcon isnt carrying passengers yet as far as i know but i think well probably be heading for other planets within a decade
space,not_removed,he was at a loss for words like a proud papa
space,not_removed,i just had to rewatch through the hosted webcast to see what you were talking about its pretty heartwarming to see a multibillionaire like elon getting choked up over an accomplishment like this
space,not_removed,good point the rockets are nothing like when i was out at the coast for a night shuttle launch and the sky lit up like day time that was beautiful to me its all still amazing though and going outside to watch a launch is just feels like a part of living here ive been doing it as long as i can remember
space,not_removed,take that romantic heartswelling feeling then watch the first episode of cooked on netflix i hadnt intended on it but having just watched that and read your comment the connection is fucking eerie humanity is because of combustion
space,not_removed,not yet the satellite feed cut out during the landing expected and pretty common but chances are theyll post the raw footage once ocisly has made it back to port and they can get their hands on the cameras themselves they dont always release much footage of these after the fact but id expect that the pr opportunity with this launch is too great to pass up
space,not_removed,i think the reason they dont understand it is that most of them grew up in that time period post so for them its not history it was a part of their lives i was discussing with a professor recently about how he subconsciously doesnt consider the gulf war to be history because he lived through it whereas i dont know much about it
space,not_removed,i hate that we viewteach history era by era anyway in my opinion the correct way to viewteach history is to pick a subject war technology crime medicine etc and do a comparative study of the different eras why teach people a load of disconnected facts and hope they put them in the right order to be able to compare them to other random facts learnt six months later
space,not_removed,vibrations mainly they can lose the data feed from the rocket same reason they lost the feed from the ship because the rockets engines were vibrating it as it was landing
space,not_removed,the vibration knocked out the satellite link they need to be pretty precise
space,not_removed,its absolutely both
space,not_removed,im pretty sure that it was the ablative paint due to the timing
space,not_removed,you simply need to attach a paper parachute to the tip of the pencil
space,not_removed,now i want to read culture i had never heard of it
space,not_removed,actually i think they probably do have payment plans over time for buying a rocket so something like easy payments of millon dollars could be a real thing
space,not_removed,in what way is a horse more advanced than say a trireme
space,not_removed,its more nuanced hour is the turnaround without refurbishing its basically inspect attach stage raise fuelup relaunch thatll be out of launches they plan on only needing to do a refurbishment once every flights
space,not_removed,blue origin hasnt actually flown anything real their flights have all been tests mostly successful tests mind you falcon landings have all been following launches of things into orbit
space,not_removed,elon is a huge dork and regularly puts stuff like that in his products the teslas have a ludicrous speed mode the model x has a biohazard defense mode and so on
space,not_removed,iirc its being disassembled for detailed scans of each part to determine the effects and stresses of a second flight on the materials hopefully they at least put the booster housing on display
space,not_removed,its so twitchy in videos its easy to underestimate how big it really is its just about thunderbird scale
space,not_removed,put it on its side there are comparable things in both the big air and space museums in the us
space,not_removed,for the gridfins they did an amazing job today d oc
space,not_removed,the grid fins are actually pretty damn big its really hard to get a scale of just how massive the falcon is without someone standing under it one grid fin is probably half or more the size of a standard board room table
space,not_removed,a grid fin is possible a landing leg would literally be bigger than any board room ive seen
space,not_removed,amortized baby production rate
space,not_removed,this was no regular launch they wanted to disassemble the rocket scan each part make sure they are in good operational form replace a few and redesign them so they dont need replacement in the future and then put it all back together test it thoroughly and only then launch the idea is to do continuous improvement so the next relaunch only needs minor maintenance and over time trend to do back to back launches with nothing more than a refuel and reload i would expect that to take them about five years which means in only five years a rocket will operate basically as an airline does today
space,not_removed,id expect spacex to only charge for the cost of the launch
space,not_removed,neil was when orville died
space,not_removed,onion classic headline deaths of confirm which mushrooms are okay to eat
space,not_removed,we werent us years ago we became us roughhhlllyyyy years ago
space,not_removed,we were still bloodletting at the turn of the century
space,not_removed,my favorite is actually that the first iphone was announced after shortly before president obama declared that he was running for president edit i was a bit off as some nice commenters below have mentioned the iphone was actually announced shortly before obama declared he would be running for president still crazy in my opinion though
space,not_removed,and still no new tool album
space,not_removed,or that were years away from the first ipod
space,not_removed,it should be more like how long it took to go from the apple newton to the iphone the newton was really amazing and a total market flop that could have sunk most companies completely the newton development started as a note in and the iphone launch was in thus took over years for apple to figure out how to do it right
space,not_removed,ha i remember that too i think its when they are talking about how the yeerks i think are afraid of humans because of how quickly we went from flying to going into space how i remember that random bit of knowledge and not my girlfriend of years birthday i dont know
space,not_removed,yea but they used britain and had an unfair naval advantage
space,not_removed,elon musk is actually the guy from the primitive technology youtube channel
space,not_removed,elon musk is playing factorio irl
space,not_removed,elon musk is actually playing real life civ on deity he is going for the science victory
space,not_removed,i heard elon musk had his memory wiped and didnt even know what a rocket was until he invented one
space,not_removed,which is both a true statement and a meaningless one since it was spacex who attempted the improbable and did it
space,not_removed,if you are going literal for sure but we are talking about explaining it to people with very little exposure
space,not_removed,yknow now that i think about it why didnt the shuttle count as reusable orbital rocket they got all of the engines back and reused them is it because the external tank wasnt recovered
space,not_removed,i like that he corrected you because he thought you were wrong you thanked him for the correction then somebody corrected him not your day today haha
space,not_removed,makes me wonder what those other independently wealthy ceos arent spending their hundreds of millions on its the effort and the vision here that sets him and his team apart
space,not_removed,too true spacexs very existence is due to musk and his vision and reach
space,not_removed,is that like the cyber
space,not_removed,hmmm in my lifetime i wonder what will cost more the ability to launch your turd into orbit or the tools necessary to actually see your turd in that orbit if you want to try to shift the balance best be figuring out how your system deals with passing glitter through
space,not_removed,we require more minerals
space,not_removed,this comment reminded me of rfactorio
space,not_removed,that is just not true for nut and bolt threaded fasteners common american torque specs for industrial use call for tightening to of the proof strength even though the bolt stretches it isnt permanent deformation unless you go further httpwwwrepairengineeringcombolttorquecharthtml
space,not_removed,or melted down somewhere id hope but yeah i dont see any reason not to replace them and a lot of reasons to
space,not_removed,hopefully the recycling dumpster
space,not_removed,you can pretty much guarantee that any nut or bolt that got removed from this rocket went straight in the dumpster if i were an engineer i would have fought to take one home
space,not_removed,they should have kept them and sold them as souvenirs i would love to have a bolt that has been to space and also help support the program
space,not_removed,musk actually named the falcon for the millennium falcon
space,not_removed,as long as they have bacon and eggs for breakfast im in
space,not_removed,it doesnt matter what they plan to do they have started the united states on a path to dominate access to low earth orbit thats not a bad thing at all but thats the reason they will be seeing growing competition nobody wants to be left behind and be stuck without access to orbit they couldnt care less about mars in the near term
space,not_removed,it seems so odd that nobody has been to the moon in years i reckon either they found aliens and were told to get off their lawn or the cold war up and moved on to a pissing match between two secret moon bases
space,not_removed,it starts carrying passengers next year
space,not_removed,he damn well deserves to be a proud rocketpapa
space,not_removed,this sort of thing is why many peoples first exposure to the irancontra affair was american dad
space,not_removed,will they be able to get the video out of the camera now that theyve recovered the rocket or is it gone forever
space,not_removed,actually they said that video from the rocket was lost because it had been using a lineofsight transmission back to the cape and the landing zone was over the horizon the barge used a satellite feed though and as you said the vibrations made it impossible to hold that signal during landing
space,not_removed,now try landing it on an rc boat in the middle of the hudson
space,not_removed,its very good start with the player of games or use of weapons the audiobook versions of them are good also
space,not_removed,such a gem of a universe that ian banks created if you love scifi youre in for a treat
space,not_removed,because a trireme needs rowers which puts it at horse power which is less than a horse checkmate spatheists
space,not_removed,thank you hearing stuff like that makes me smile
space,not_removed,well you gotta do what you gotta do for rd thoughi would love to see that booster on display in the smithsonian national air and space museum
space,not_removed,yeah but will they try dipping it in cold water
space,not_removed,lets reassemble it then after theyre done
space,not_removed,as an engineer this is what i assumed would happen there are also nondestructive methods that can be used but cutting it up and hitting it with an electron microscope is the most efficient way to locate stress fractures delam discontinuites etc
space,not_removed,they are upgrading them from press convo musk new design coming for grid fin will be largest titanium forging in the world current grid fin is aluminum and gets so hot it lights on fire which isnt good for reuse
space,not_removed,why would you expect that to take years seems like a shot in the dark
space,not_removed,nope they cut the price only elon said they still need to pay off the billion in reusability development costs for which was on their own dime well passed on to their customers so the price reduction has to be equal to the cost savings ive calculated they make about million in profit off a regular million falcon flight and off the million flight they charged for this one they also made about million in profit but a reused booster is only the cost of the fuel plus the upper stage about million plus payload fairing which is usually but as of today are now reusable since theyve added a parachute and small thrusters to it to splash it down in the ocean
space,not_removed,sounds like an opening of a story
space,not_removed,yeahthat seems about right i literally remember the moment i was contemplating buying a pda ipod and razr but then having a conversation with my coworker about how amazing it would be to have all three devices combined into one and i felt like someone surely was going to make that if i held out long enough a few months later we watched the iphone announcement keynote together during work and it was like fireworks in our office
space,not_removed,wait really like for real it doesnt feel like those happened together
space,not_removed,fucking elizabeth
space,not_removed,i think they were playing as greek and got a science boost and then went right for the great library
space,not_removed,more like ksp and factorio at the same time
space,not_removed,nasa did what was considered impossible many many times just because you cut the legs off a giant doesnt make you taller both entities are fucking amazing we dont need to downplay either both are insanely amazing
space,not_removed,because shuttles where technically the payload were talking reusable boosters now with what spacex is doing
space,not_removed,musk is defnitely key to moving as fast as they are but i dont think jeff bezos has become a rocket engineer he purely just funds blue origin so the rich people can still accomplish things without having to throw themselves into the deep end money can do a lot although in the us it seems rich people either donate to charity to deal with short term humanity problems or waste it in politics i hope musk and bezos do inspire obscenely rich people to invest in future technologies to make them happen decades sooner than they otherwise would have
space,not_removed,say spacex fast enough and it sounds like space sex
space,not_removed,just put it in geostationary orbit right above you then just look up and its there
space,not_removed,luckily we can mine asteroids with reusable rockets
space,not_removed,you must land additional pylons
space,not_removed,what about vespene gas where are we going to get those
space,not_removed,i hear asteroids have plenty of them
space,not_removed,wouldnt that mean you only have of proof strength as workable strain that you can apply to the bolt in that direction
space,not_removed,one mans dumpster is another mans spare parts bin
space,not_removed,it matters a lot getting companies to pay for them to learn how to make reusable rockets allows them to then do phase which is not about dominating launching although that will happen too it is about the internet satellite array it is the real way space x is going to pay for the its
space,not_removed,we have been focusing on landing and operating robots on mars for the past years way cooler
space,not_removed,they should have the footage they usually release some sort of landing video afterwards once they get their hands on the equipment
space,not_removed,i knew that the names were refrences but i never realized until now thanks i am going to get the audio book now you recommend starting with the book
space,not_removed,hey consider phlebus isnt bad
space,not_removed,oh god player of games first maybe even matter or look to windward before use of weapons anachronic plots are serious business
space,not_removed,they can always put it back together for display i imagine that they would have to take it apart to clean out any toxic chemicals before it could be displayed anyway
space,not_removed,supposedly elon offered the smithsonian the first landed booster thats sitting outside hawthorne now but the smithsonian wouldnt accept it unless spacex paid for the hall it would hangstand in and they didnt want to do that
space,not_removed,get outta here feynman and go back to eating brains
space,not_removed,i noticed that one of the fins was glowing during reentry just today i hadnt noticed that before this flight but thats maybe because they dont usually have video feed during that part of the mission
space,not_removed,i thought they were aluminum but couldnt find any citation oh well now i know
space,not_removed,youre assuming there are no costs other than the launch vehicle itself we dont know how the cost breakup for looks but for a lot of older launch systems the launch vehicle itself was only of the launch cost with significant amounts flowing into range costs operating costs etc
space,not_removed,orville you cant die theres still much to be invented youre our only hope no there is another dies in a dramatically and needlessly long dying scene over epic music
space,not_removed,and nobody remembers that there was already a windows phone available kind of like today
space,not_removed,i remember everyone changed their status on msn messenger when he won
space,not_removed,the first gen iphone was announced january barack obama announced his presidential candidacy on february he has it backwards edit but still time flys
space,not_removed,yup and the so it was pretty close in the grand scheme of things plus the obama campaign probably doesnt really gain steam until later than the iphone was out
space,not_removed,would you be interested in a trade agreement with england
space,not_removed,would you be interested in a trade agreement with england
space,not_removed,nephew delet this
space,not_removed,would you be interested in a trade agreement with england
space,not_removed,that would make an amazing game
space,not_removed,hes playing human space program on hard mode no reverting to the vab
space,not_removed,you can get compounded returns if you save enough lives though i mean look at the work that bill gates has done in it was estimated that he saved million lives i wonder what kind of innovation would come out of those million people i mean youll never know for sure because its not like they know exactly which people would have died but you can imagine that the positive effect here is pretty enormous not to detract what what musk is doing im just arguing that the short term humanitarian stuff is important too
space,not_removed,speaking of which did pornhub ever actually do that
space,not_removed,considering that and the tesla naming scheme id guess that it was intentional
space,not_removed,we require more rocket fuel
space,not_removed,elon has shot this idea down before now he can shoot it down with reusable rockets
space,not_removed,the first book is really different from the other ones so a lot of people recommend starting with the second for the most part each story is independent with small references to previous books
space,not_removed,i would recommend player of games before use of weapons since it makes it helps you understand the cultures motivations and beliefs a bit better
space,not_removed,theyre heavy dense scifi dont get me wrongl theyre amazing and full of wonderful ideas but they are dense
space,not_removed,its an odd start to a series because of the pov of the main characters its great just an unconventional start to the universe if were going for unconventional starts id do inversions
space,not_removed,other than the teateb igniter fluid the bulk liquids on the rocket are annoying at worst you could shower in and the lox leaves by itself
space,not_removed,so now spacex will build the next more important space museum that will house the first modern rockets and the first interplanetary spacecraft
space,not_removed,dont be too hard on the smithsonian though im sure the endless republican drive to do away with anything uplifting that our government previously excelled at has left another once great institution with barely enough resources to function let alone expand so under the current political climate where government is supposed to be weak and business strong its totally appropriate to ask spacex to foot the bill
space,not_removed,surely you must be joking
space,not_removed,this mission was to gto so it was the fasted speed their stages will ever go for a launch it might not have caught fire for lower orbit trajectories where the rocket wasnt travelling as fast
space,not_removed,and inspecting that thing and makign sure it can fly again in an extremely thorough way since its the first time was not cheap this whole thing was probably way more expensive than flying a new rocket for spacex because its the first of its kind
space,not_removed,zoom in of the car reveals a black camaro
space,not_removed,except youre talking about the days of which was a steaming pile of shit compared to even early versions of ios yeah feature for feature it had more features than ios but ios didnt make you hate using your phone every time you used it
space,not_removed,yep i had a htc in and that was a real smartphone the iphone wasnt even haha
space,not_removed,doom rpg on windows mobile was amazing
space,not_removed,i remember my samsung still the second best phone i ever had
space,not_removed,but europeans probably remember nokia at the time that thing wasis amazing hook up your keyboard mouse and monitor and you had a mobile workstation
space,not_removed,man that press release wasnt kidding when they said it was revolutionary i never imagined how ingrained our phones would become as a part of society
space,not_removed,found the canadian
space,not_removed,no i dont want a trade deal you took one of my cities in the classic era jerk and i have you boxed in right after montezuma oh sorry flashbacks
space,not_removed,not until after brexit thanks
space,not_removed,maybe thats where all the ksp devs went
space,not_removed,or a better example the green revolution let india refocus a lot of their attention away from keeping their citizens alive and they now have a successful space flight program
space,not_removed,sadly they werent able to receive the required funding theres always hope for the future though maybe pornhub could start their own rocket company and in years well get our first space porno
space,not_removed,no they didnt they didnt raise the money on kickstarter
space,not_removed,no the logistics were all fucked without gravity turns out jizz does not work well in g
space,not_removed,thats what water is for

space,not_removed,see you in another shuttle brotha
space,not_removed,thats what i was thinking too wanted to see if someone with more knowledge of such things than me could enlighten
space,not_removed,its not for docking there was no docking port there on mir its some sort of attachment they put on the outside of a window you can see the symmetric window covered by a shutter to the right and a similar window with its shutter open on the centerline below them being on a window id guess that thing was used for observation somehow
space,not_removed,its a diffuser for the urine vent system judging by its location and the look on comrade polyakovs face
space,not_removed,when i said docking i didnt mean like for transferring people maybe docking for transferring some supplies or something else smaller than human size
space,not_removed,how the fuck did they get in and out
space,not_removed,mir had docking ports the poster is saying there wasnt one there
space,not_removed,he was saying that we didnt discover the first exoplanets until the how is it we didnt see other planets with hubble and other scopes well hubble wasnt launched until the but hubble isnt the best instrument for detecting exoplanets the easiest method and the one that was used to detect the first exoplanet around a normal star pegasi b in is the radial velocity method this method involves measuring the speed of the star toward or away from us very precisely with a spectrograph as a planet orbits its star its gravity tugs the star back and forth very slightly and the doppler shift of the starlight can tell us the planet is there the spectrograph that detected this first exoplanet was elodie and it became operational in before then we just didnt have the technology to measure radial velocity precisely enough to detect a planet
space,not_removed,holy reddit not a single comment is correct and they are all repeating the status years ago there have been exoplanets directly imaged in prior to that in the there was wobble in the local star and dimmingbrightening that were indications of exoplanets look at that image what is the almost overwhelming feature the local star you have to be kind of out of it to not have seen the news a few weeks ago of the vortex coronagraph and adaptive optics mask methods to blank out the local star and be able to do long exposure on just the reflected light from the planets these are huge developments and makes direct imaging of exoplanets now that was predicted a few years ago as years from now the ability to mask out the local star also allows for detailed spectrograph analysis of the reflected light from the exoplanet meaning starting to detect water and atmosphere exoplanet search and imaging had a step jump in development a few weeks ago
space,not_removed,hubble is very good at viewing long distances but its actually resolution is low meaning it doesnt pick up the minimal light changes that a planet passing between its star and the earth produces well at all we cant and dont directly observe exoplanets we observe their effects on their local star
space,not_removed,it is very very difficult to see planets directly instead we find them by closely monitoring stars for wobble or periodic dimming caused by planets this takes a lot more time
space,not_removed,i was under the impression we didnt know precisely where to point it as in the ballpark rarely works for astronomical distance zoom and that the light reflecting from the planets was too faint to pick up in comparison to starlight thats why we used techniques like looking for slight wobbles in the appearance of stars or occlusion that made the light periodically dimmer as the planet passed in front as for why that all came about in the i cant say as im not an expert but the rest should be accurate
space,not_removed,we dont discover exoplanets by seeing them optically with telescopes we detect them indirectly by measuring very fine periodic oscillations in the brightness of nearby stars and for that you need some very sensitive equipment also by detecting very subtle wiggles in the stars spectrum caused by gravitational effects of the planets its like a lot of other things we couldnt find them until we had good enough equipment
space,not_removed,the fact that a handful of planetary systems have now been directly imaged does not change the fact that today the vast majority of exoplanets are not detected via direct imaging was discovered via transits aka the status quo years ago as almost always youre very good at reciting buzzwords but you have no idea what they mean
space,not_removed,thats a bit of misleading article the first imaged exoplanets were around hr in
space,not_removed,what would cause the slight wobbles in the appearance of stars to occur
space,not_removed,planets dont orbit a perfectly stationary star the star and the planet both orbit the common center of mass since a star is ridiculously huge and a planet relatively small the center of mass is close to the stars center but its enough of a difference for us to see the star moving while the planet revolves thats how a few exoplanets were discovered
space,not_removed,all information and images were taken off vadim lukashevichs website httpwwwburanruhtmhomepagehtm and translated by me these are the very early variants of buran created in theres not much information on the early development of the soviet shuttle in western media leading to generalizations like httpimgurcomahzvxd actually the development was something like this after the order to begin development was given original spaceplane orbitalny samolyot tons was created it was a very rough mockup that copied the shuttles engine configuration however it had serious flaws and the engineers found out copying the shuttle in its entirety would be very difficult for the soviet industry because they didnt have the same technological base the usa did npo energia took over the project had a look at discarded it and proposed their own spaceplane project it was approved and energia started refining it unlike they didnt copy the shuttle they would look similar however because the technical demands were absolutely the same and the soviet higherups wanted to see an equivalent spacecraft after years of work the final version of buran was born
space,not_removed,this article makes it sound like a cheap knockoff but really it had way better features could fly autonomously had an actual launch escape system why does every article about russia have to talk so much shit
space,not_removed,i still dont understand why the space shuttle isnt a thing anymore isnt it cheaper to refly rockets
space,not_removed,copied there and copy of that you guys dont sound as engineering folk similar problems give birth to similar solutions in case of any kind of engineering the efficiency is an absolute goal so here you have it buran class spaceplane which looks like space shuttle both vehicles have similar goals to achieve and similar purpose no wonder that they look alike for instance take a look at jet fighters try to compare several vehicles of similar class and youll find them look alike both in technical way and aesthetical
space,not_removed,thanks for posting this was a good lookread i really need to get myself to technik speyer in germany to see the buran prototype okgli seeing all the space shuttles is the top of my bucket list

space,not_removed,looks like a bluff lets make the same design and add more rockets to it thatll get em spending more money
space,not_removed,could they have at least attempted a slightly original design reminds me of the concordski
space,not_removed,oh so they didnt copy the space shuttle my favorite part nasa creating blueprints with red herrings which the soviets adopted in an august technical analysis of the similarities between the two shuttles were hints of the programs success particularly in the development of heatresistant tiles that protected the shuttle as it reentered the earths atmosphere with regard to the use of ablative or adhesive material in gaps between tiles on some surfaces a johnson spaceflight center engineer noted soviets have ablative material in their elevon gaps just like we did we fooled them and now use tiles in the gaps on another page of the analysis the anonymous engineer noted another disparity was probably due to their stolen technology freeze in the early the entire buran program was based on technology transfer through spying or gathering freely available documents the key in terms of the shuttle program was overt collection and specifically the use of commercial databases in effect the massive effort directed at the us space shuttle program was among the first cases of internet espionage if not the first case documents acquired dealt with airframe designs including the computer programs on design analysis materials flight computer systems and propulsion systems this information allowed soviet military industries to save years of scientific research and testing time as well as millions of rubles as they developed their own very similar space shuttle vehicle intelligence officials told nbc news that the soviets had saved billions on their shuttle program by using online spying they didnt have to put their orbiter through all the wind tunnel tests and computer simulations we did because our test data was available to them
space,not_removed,this was actually my takeaway as well wow the buran had a les the shuttle didnt really have any kind of les also its payload per launch must have been much better by losing all those huge main engines and keeping only the orbital thrusters it saved a ton of weight its actually a much more useful craft really our space shuttle was a bit of a frankensteins monster it never did its job particularly well and thats no surprise it was never supposed to be put into use the way that it was what we know as the shuttle is really half of the original vision a complete orbiter strapped onto a transitional test booster that booster was never meant to be used long term alas it worked well enough in that transitional configuration so it never made it to the reusability that was the original goal
space,not_removed,because we actually built and flew a fleet of shuttles for years and russia built and tested one shuttle on one unmanned flight they had a second nearly finished but at the end of the day the americans did and the soviets proposed
space,not_removed,was it truly autonomous or just remote control i dont see any distinction or other information on it on the wikipedia page autonomous is a much bigger achievement than remote control
space,not_removed,its not about russia its about the soviet union a lot of people forget that russia was the first country to fall to communism
space,not_removed,show us where anything you said was more than just vaporware ill settle for evidence of just one successful russian space shuttle mission on the other hand after the us space shuttle was retired with multiple documented missions we still have the that can orbit for years
space,not_removed,originally the idea was just to put the expensive crewsupport orbital mission parts in a gliding return craft which would have saved money and landed more gently however congress and the air force got involved and mandated all kinds of requirements like no separate booster vehicle heavy cargo capability long glide range etc the engineers did what they could with those constraints but ultimately the strain put on the engines made them timeconsuming to refurbish the tanks had to be built for every launch and the manufacturer turned out to be unable to keep up the pace of production and the srbs were more dangerous than liquid engines would have been so the shuttle became hugely expensive
space,not_removed,isnt it cheaper to refly rockets remains to be seen what is the cost of refurbishment vs building new it may have been less expensive to refurbish the orbiter each mission but you still had boosters and tankage that needed built flights per year were not enough to capture economy of scale especially in spaceflight i think i read that the shuttles needed a flight rate of one per week to make it economical
space,not_removed,the problem is that the shuttle wasnt really reusable but rather recyclable after landing the entire craft needed to be disassembled broken parts swapped out and then reassembled
space,not_removed,the shuttle is a large heavy payload that is unnecessary
space,not_removed,even if fails at reusability and that is highly unlikley one flight costs about the same as a single shuttle solid booster and payload of is simmilar to the shuttle and prices are for and for shuttle flight
space,not_removed,columbia was really what killed it off it was clear that there wasnt really a way to prevent what had happened to columbia from happening to the other shuttles in the fleet and so as long as we kept flying the shuttle wed keep putting our astronauts in quite a lot of risk the only way to mitigate this risk was to have another shuttle on standby to serve as a rescue craft but obviously that one could also be damaged having to plan each mission in such a way that there was an another orbiter on standby made everything even more expensive and time consuming the decision was made to wind the program down in a deliberate fashion rather than to continue to fly them indefinitely and although this left us without a way into space it was almost certainly the right choice
space,not_removed,the space shuttle was just designed very badly for its task and its humongous cost and poor reliability eventually resulted in termination of the project it also made other space agencies nervous about developing their own space planes however there are multiple space plane designs being tested currently the us air force is doing experiments with the and the esa is working on the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiintermediateexperimentalvehicle there are several other space plane projects currently in their design stages including the brittish httpsenwikipediaorgwikiskylonspacecraft and the indian httpsenwikipediaorgwikiavatarspacecraft space planes
space,not_removed,and espionage has a large role in that as well
space,not_removed,that is so naive its almost cute
space,not_removed,the rockwell international shuttle engineers put red herrings inside their blueprints to see if the soviets were copying and it seems the soviets copied the red herrings
space,not_removed,it was probably a little about that but more about being able to not only lift heavy military satellites into orbit but also bring them back safely that was the big military advantage the american space shuttle had before the buran
space,not_removed,its a bit hard to make an original design when the required specifications are the same as the shuttles besides soviet design firms also proposed at least other projects of a reusable orbital spaceplane that were all rejected in favour of buran
space,not_removed,the russians did have an original spaceplane project in the form of the but when the space shuttle was unveiled the russians quickly figured out that a it was a bad design and b it was apparently designed to fly missions that would allow it to reach the soviet union this made them paranoid that the space shuttle would have some military goal that they couldnt figure out and thats why they coppied it
space,not_removed,even though youre joking or something you may be interested in knowing samsung developed its own launch vehicles in the for korean satellites
space,not_removed,no they never end up working
space,not_removed,i took from ops post that they did copy the space shuttle at least in the beginning after they discovered they simply couldnt copy and paste the design the slowly redesigned it into the buran
space,not_removed,at the same time dream chaser copied which you can find on the same website
space,not_removed,they didnt have to put their orbiter through all the wind tunnel tests and computer simulations we did because our test data was available to them except that and later on spend lots of money on launching into suborbital trajectory why if you have readymade american data on your hands it doesnt quite add up id say the soviet intelligence was stealing data for estimating the exact specifications and purposes of the shuttle it was a big source of anxiety among the top brass of the soviet military who demanded an equivalent spacecraft they didnt want to end up with an inferior spacecraft in a space war after all the wise guys developing back in also thought they could simply copy the shuttle until they found out that it was simply infeasible because the ussr lagged behind the us in certain technologies used by the shuttle like solid rocket boosters cryogenic fuel lines and the reusable main engines for the orbiter httpwwwburanruhtmsadovskyhtm so the soviet design firms had to go the hard way using the shuttles specifications as a target
space,not_removed,in the us obviously copied the soviet designs time travel
space,not_removed,because the soviets realized how bad of an idea it was more expensive more dangerous less payload and more maintenance the only thing going for it is that it looks impressive during launch and the soviets have never been in it for looks just send cargo up on unmanned rockets and send crew up in dedicated vehicles safer and easier you dont need a shuttle to build a large space station mir was tons and launched across launches of expendable launch vehicles not counting the shuttle launch which only delivered the shuttle docking adapter the only reason the shuttle was used to build the iss is that the shuttle is what was available we could have done it differently and better using traditional rockets a saturn vclass rocket could have done it in launches and would have been much cheaper to fly you dont need a shuttle to have an onorbit lab you can build yourself a space station or build and launch a dedicated lab for the cost of shuttle flight satellite repair is a nonstarter even back when the shuttle was being designed and shopped around and retrieval is even worse the only moderate success of the shuttle is hubble but the for the cost of storing it for years delayed because of challenger and flying repair missions a whole new telescope could have been built and launched finally dont even think about mentioning ldef theres no reason why it had to be done the way it was again it was a matter of every problem looking like nail it could have been put into a deployable bay and reentered behind a heatshield and aeroshell its not a mark of pride that nasa flew the shuttle for all those years even former nasa administrator griffin said the shuttle was a mistake and the wrong path the soviets figured that out real quick so did nasa but they didnt tell anybody
space,not_removed,on one unmanned flight well the shuttle couldnt fly unmanned also it had no les the soviets abandoned the buran because the shuttle is not an economically viable alternative to rockets
space,not_removed,it was truly autonomous when i was in moscow i went to go see one of the only burans left the short video in the exhibit explained that during decent the buran made a series of unexpected turns apparently it detected strong winds and corrected for that automatically it was quite the machine
space,not_removed,the shuttle itself is completely fly by wire and the only thing keeping it from being able to fly a mission entirely autonomously were that you had to change the data tapes out on orbit and there were a couple of switches that the astronauts had to throw manually postcolumbia the shuttle carried a cable that would allow the computer system to interface with the couple of things that it couldnt normally operate in order to allow it to reenter autonomously the plan was to dump it into the pacific ocean if this had ever been necessary but theres no real reason it couldnt have been landed this way once you develop the expertise needed to design a fly by wire system that will enable an aircraft to be flyable anywhere from mph miles up through to like feet up an autopilot system is pretty laughable by comparison
space,not_removed,fall to communism thats not how history works communism is a successor stage following the overthrow of capitalism
space,not_removed,show us where anything you said was more than just vaporware buran demonstrated the the autonomous flight when it underwent its first spaceflight test which was successful albeit unmanned not sure about the launch escape system the space shuttle had similar capabilities but they were disabled iirc shuttle pilots werent comfortable with not having direct control over the craft either way burans failure had nothing to do with buran itself at least that we know of today it was mothballed as a result of the collapse of the ussr had that collapse not taken place or done so a bit later we mightve actually seen buran in some semblance of active use
space,not_removed,well they did have one successful mission but that was all they had
space,not_removed,show us where anything you said was more than just vaporware anything well how about this could fly autonomously of buran performing an autonomous landing after autonomous flight
space,not_removed,also after years things werent as young as they used to be
space,not_removed,it does not remain to be seen it most certainly is cheaper the shuttle was the most expensive vehicle ever to fly in terms of usable payload i think i read that the shuttles needed a flight rate of one per week to make it economical former shuttle program director robert thompson said it best in at the time we were selling the program at the start of phase b the people in washington charlie donlan some of them got a company called mathematica to come in and do an analysis of operating costs mathematica sat down and attempted to do some work on operating costs and they discovered something they discovered the more you flew the cheaper it got per flight fabulous so they added as many flights as they could they got up to to flights a year hell anyone reasonably knew you werent going to fly times a year the most capability we ever put in the program is when we built the facilities for the tank at michoud we left growth capability to where you could get up to flights a year by producing tanks if you really wanted to get that high we never thought youd ever get above or flights a year so when you want to say could you fly it for x million dollars some of the charts of the document i sent you last night look ridiculous in todays world go back years to purchasing power of the dollar and those costs per flight were not the cost of ownership they were only the costs between vehicle design that were critical to the design because thats what we were trying to make a decision on if they didnt matter you have to have a control center over here whether youve got a twostage fullyreusable vehicle or a stageandahalf vehicle so we didnt try to throw the cost of ownership into that it would have made it look much bigger so thats where those very low costperflight numbers came from they were never real
space,not_removed,you only get figures like to billion per flight if youre rolling all of the program costs up and then dividing by flights this isnt really the correct way to figure out should we keep flying the shuttle since canceling the shuttle doesnt get us the money we spent building the orbiters or developing the ssme back
space,not_removed,the only way to mitigate this risk was to have another shuttle on standby to serve as a rescue craft but obviously that one could also be damaged having to plan each mission in such a way that there was an another orbiter on standby made everything even more expensive and time consuming the soviets tried to mitigate some of the risk by refitting several soyuz ships with burancompatible apas ports in theory a pair of could be stored at baikonur ready for rollout
space,not_removed,and rumours from a friend of a friend of an acquaintance say the made the russians pull the from the junkyard
space,not_removed,the shuttle is the stupidest space program ever and there was no advantage you can send satellites to orbit using normal rockets like today also whats the point of brining back a satellite you could build a new satellite and lunch it in orbit for less than lunching the shuttle to retrieve an outdated satellite thats would have needed to be refurbished the whole reason why the shuttle was designed so big was because the air force was planning on lunching nukes from the bay while also capturing enemy satellites after the space treaty that banned nukes in space the air force abandoned the project leaving nasa with this wasteful shuttle design nasa had no choice but to continue with the project because anymore delays would have forced congress defund it nasa wasted so much valuable funding during those years operating the shuttle if the shuttle was canceled nasa today would have had a dozen more rovers in different planets and many more space telescopes
space,not_removed,tell that to boeing and airbus amazing how this culture permeated throughout the technological development in the ussr at that time
space,not_removed,hrm i had read somewhere that rather than being a blatant copy the soviet engineers concluded that nasa developed the ideal design for the mission set and so went with it or i am thinking of the concordeski
space,not_removed,reusable main engines for the orbiter was this really an issue that is tons literally of mass that needed to be boosted that could have gone to payload the were then ripped apart after each mission and refurbished i am not sure the soviets didnt come out on the better end of the equation on this one
space,not_removed,why if you have readymade american data on your hands it doesnt quite add up id say so youre saying if they stole the blueprints there was no need for tests anymore have you ever tried to build something yourself experienced that things dont go as planned you know luckily we today know a lot about httpsenwikipediaorgwikivladimirvetrov or the and well id think the red herrings like the elevon gaps are pretty good proof too
space,not_removed,the soviets knew from the start that the final design shuttle was a bad idea but they didnt know why the americans settled on that design the idea of a spaceplane was not alien to the russians they had their own space plane project in the from that project they knew that the optimal design was a fairly small spaceplane used for carrying light loads into equatorial orbits the spaceshuttle was far bigger and designed to reach polar orbits and the russians couldnt figgure out why the americans went with this design therefor they assumed the americans knew something they didnt and they feared that the space shuttle would have military uses thats why they followed the american design had the russians known the real reason for the shuttles weird design they would have either continued with their moon base project or designed a completely different space plane
space,not_removed,this is my opinion as well the iss could have been designed with fewer larger modules lifted by only a few heavy lift vehicles even the shuttlec derivative of the stack would have been a better way to get heavy cargo on orbit space station freedom later the iss was designed entirely to give the shuttle something to do and a place to go especially after the dod backed off and eelv and foreign competition was a better option for government and commercial satellite launch
space,not_removed,before you make assumptions the idea of their shuttle was better communism is also better theoretically but both lacked execution on russias part so here we are talking shit about russia
space,not_removed,that and the cold war ended a year after its first flight and the soviet union collapsed two years after that the russians cancelled it because they were broke and had bigger things to worry about
space,not_removed,because we all know one of the main goals of the soviet union was economical optimization fuck me dude that is some clever comedy
space,not_removed,the original shuttle designs were economically viable alternatives for rocket launches thats the whole reason the project was started up in the first place but nasa didnt have the money to fund the shuttle project especially after the rounds of defunding that followed the end of the apollo project so they had to get the air force involved and the air force demanded a shuttle that was far bigger than the original plans and that could reach polar orbits this all lead to a significant redesign which drove the price up and the reliability down
space,not_removed,comrade its time for your medicine and then its down for a nap you dont want to be cranky when judge judy comes on at
space,not_removed,imperial russia was anything but capitalist in fact i cant name a single capitalist country that got overthrown and turned into a communist state
space,not_removed,this just boils down to a different philosophy between the two flight cultures analysis of both programs highlights american distrust of soviet automated systems and soviet distrust of american manned systems specifically the apollosoyuz test project was where this came up another example comes from reports by american astronauts training in russia that their cosmonaut counterparts werent respected by ground control and engineers in comparison american astronauts are frequently brought into the design process just cultural differences man
space,not_removed,either way burans failure had nothing to do with buran itself yes and no while the buran was probably better than the shuttle i dont see any indication that it was cost effective there were other soviet rockets that survived the collapse of the soviet union
space,not_removed,the heat shields look brand new so it didnt reenter the earths atmosphere not much of a space shuttle
space,not_removed,not sure this quote says what you want it to say the shuttle could never reach flight economies of scale and we may have been better served making saturn systems for heavy lift instead of trying the space truck route spacexs experiment in reusability is still in the tbd phase considering that musk only needs revenue not profit i am not sure it is an apples to apples comparison against other carriers
space,not_removed,fixed cost of shuttle infrastructure was around and with just orbiters after there was no way for increasing the filght rate without increasing the fixed costs of infrastructure even moreeven the et alone was mil and each srm around
space,not_removed,technically correct however the shuttle had a design lifetime of about years had you wanted to continue flying the shuttle you may have needed to build new ones or deal with rapidly escalating maintenance costs
space,not_removed,the treaty that banned nukes in space happened long before the shuttle was designed
space,not_removed,its an issue if you want to make a copy of the spaceshuttle which they didnt buran does not have any main engines all power comes from energia
space,not_removed,even the shuttlec derivative of the stack would have been a better way to get heavy cargo on orbit just thinking about it makes my hair stand on end how much more useful payload it could put up and how much less it would have cost without the orbiter edit also safety
space,not_removed,uhm did you read that article it has nothing in common with the space shuttle except for the name its a design for a spacecraft that will stay in space permanently rather than returning to earth it has no wings no reentry tiles nothing
space,not_removed,yes but to say that the american shuttle was better is dishonest the buran was a far better shuttle the ability to fly autonomously and a launch escape system both of which the shuttle lacked made the buran a safer vehicle however it was not economically viable and neither was the shuttle yes the shuttle was operational but that doesnt make it better the shuttle programme killed people partly because an inability to fly unmanned and a lack of a les and cost a total of billion dollars
space,not_removed,judge judy is a bourgeois construct concocted by the western oligarchy to oppress and marginalize the voices of the proletariat real communists watch the peoples court
space,not_removed,youre right it had a budding capitalist industry but was predominantly a serfdom
space,not_removed,cultural differences that killed people because they had to be present on a cargo launch
space,not_removed,the ones that did survive were better tested at the time between something experimental like buran and something triedandtrue like soyuz it shouldnt be surprising that the latter survived an economic and political collapse while the former rotted away
space,not_removed,i dont see any indication that it was cost effective it was very costeffective when you threw out the spaceplane and flew just the energiya with an payload blister
space,not_removed,well youre wrong buran made an unmanned orbital flight followed by an autonomous landing httpsenwikipediaorgwikiburanspacecraftorbitalflight
space,not_removed,im terribly embarrassed for you burans orbital test flight in the waning days of soviet empire are well documented for the sake of your credibility i hope you acknowledge your error and move on instead of moving the goalposts now
space,not_removed,not sure this quote says what you want it to say i wanted it to say that it wasnt possible for it to fly once per week and even if it was the economical price was never real
space,not_removed,total program cost of the shuttle was around billion a year in dollars figuring launches a year this works out to million a flight this is still obviously a lot of money but is off from even your low estimate by a factor of
space,not_removed,both vehicles were stupid designs pushed that way because of dod pressures for the us and cold war pressures for the russians the russians were just lucky and smart enough to not have wasted years on it
space,not_removed,it doesnt matter if their shuttle was better and thats not what i was implying this is the most infuriating thing about engineers they think that technologically superior superior product not true at all in fact the opposite is often true the american shuttle was just good enough it used srbs because they were cheaper and less complex flew in dead stick because jets just add more complexity and more room for failure there were plans to upgrade the thing with lrbs and better engines once they got enough flights to work the bugs out of the system but challenger basically torpedoed that at the end of the day we built a shuttle you could fly and maintain and they built something they could never afford in the first place do you know what is objectively the greatest space vehicle ever made the soyuz same basic design for the last years with incremental improvements to the whole system really nothing sophisticated about it it just gets humans off planet on to the station it does this reliably cheaply and routinely and considering the history of human spaceflight that it something to be proud of
space,not_removed,yes the shuttle was operational but that doesnt make it better from an engineering point of view it certainly does
space,not_removed,молодец well done tovarish have your order of lenin
space,not_removed,one unmanned launch i stand corrected their space program was a success and their space shuttle is better than what the us space shuttle accomplished in all its missions
space,not_removed,the only embarrassment is this propaganda about space junk
space,not_removed,i can agree to that which is why reusing rockets is still tbd for cost savings spacex has a good path forward and i am hopeful but i am also waiting for data and a good comparison against other launch systems stupid autocorrect
space,not_removed,two of the programs flights have ended in tragedy killing astronauts in all recent nasa estimates peg the shuttle programs cost through the end of last year at billion in dollars yielding a perflight cost of nearly billion and the orbiter fleet never flew more than nine missions in a single year
space,not_removed,i think that the apollo stack was also better but nasa couldnt afford to keep it as a fallback
space,not_removed,youre implying that the soviet space shuttle was more expensive than the nasas shuttle that may not be the case i dont think we have the data to say it honestly the american space shuttle was not good enough its just that nasa had more than enough money to waste on the project
space,not_removed,not really the reasons for the burans cancellation were not related to the design but to economical and political issues within the soviet union
space,not_removed,actually from an engineering point of view killing people would be considered a failure
space,not_removed,whoa there big guy maybe its time for a nap
space,not_removed,yikes i hope you can grow out of whatever convinced you to double down on ignorance its one thing to be mistaken and take correction its another thing to this
space,not_removed,yes like i said back in my first post you get numbers like that if you roll up all the costs and divide by the number of flights however many of those costs are sunk costs the kind where you dont get your money back if you stop doing whatever it is youre doing if youre trying to figure out if you want to keep flying the shuttle it doesnt make sense to act like rocketdyne is going to pay back the money that nasa gave them to develop the ssme back in the if you stop the program now
space,not_removed,its a shame if we werent grounded for years thanks nixon after apollo soyuz we could have built a block iii csm that would have been lighter and cheaper and easily could have kept flying on either an upgraded saturn or titan series of rockets today the modern cms would have been one of the most reliable spacecraft ever built and northrup probably would have been selling rides on them for private companies
space,not_removed,i didnt say otherwise but why make a shuttle for one trip the word implies a craft that makes multiple flights one flight does not make an operational shuttle
space,not_removed,yes this includes development costs but that is true for every system sadly sts outside of downmass capability had little to offer for the insane price point and low flight ratewould flying the sts for few more years decrease average cost yes but every flight would still be nearly an order of magnitude more expensive than comparable expendable launchers like atlasv and deltaiv
space,not_removed,the plan was to use the shuttle for mir too but the collapse of the ussr forced them to ground the project i believe the buran they used was not the complete thing i think it was probably baikal the one that was planned to be manned
space,not_removed,financing cuts do you speak em
space,not_removed,the deltaiv heavy runs something like million per lauch which is significantly cheaper than million but not anywhere near an order of magnitude the cost of the spacecraft that would be carrying your astronauts is also not included in this million cost i dont think theres really anyone who who thinks the space shuttle was some kind of raging success theres no reason to pad the numbers
space,not_removed,buran was a full scale model there was nothing missing or not present
space,not_removed,thats why they built a shuttle that only flew once and carried nobody i thought it was because the country fell apart
space,not_removed,delta ivh is an extreme example and provides to gto vs for the shuttlethere are very few missions that require humans on board and launch vehicle can do without them and things like hubble would be cheaper to send a new telescope instead of repair tripsshame that cargo variant of the shuttle was never realised because it could be interesting to have to leo for lower price than sts launch also is when expendable and has of gto capability and yet again without shuttle centaur there was little capability beyond leo for sts and that can be done in a much cheaper way by the lifters like deltaivh or back then by titaniv and soon fh will be as powerfull while retaining landing capability to the range of to leo
space,not_removed,wasnt life support and other things not present
space,not_removed,as far as i know everything was present
space,not_removed,live rosetta conference end of mission from paris now sept
space,not_removed,to me it looks like the paint is igniting it happened so fast if the metal itself was overheating you would see a more uniform glow across the surface of the fin right
space,not_removed,the kerbal way use the engines as the heatshield
space,not_removed,i was sure he was not the only one who had noticed that
space,not_removed,damn didnt even notice that can it cause a major failure
space,not_removed,in the same talk where he described casting a titanium replacement he said that the aluminum was burning sounds as if it was more than just the paint and we have seen melted off fins on previous grid fins
space,not_removed,probably not its likely just paint burning off which is meant to be able to since its ablation paint
space,not_removed,image credit jay anderson data modis satellite nasas gsfc explanation are you planning to see the american eclipse on august a few hours after sunrise a rare total eclipse of the sun will be visible along a narrow path across the usa those only near the path will see a partial eclipse although some americans live right in path of totality surely many more will be able to get there after a wellplanned drive one problem with eclipses though is that clouds sometimes get in the way to increase your clearviewing odds you might consult the featured map and find a convenient destination with a historically low chance more blue of thick clouds overhead during totality given the large fraction of americans carrying cameraequipped smartphones this american eclipse may turn out to be the most photographed event in the history of the world
space,not_removed,so the scale is for the average cloud amount in the given month is better or i ask this because i feel like the blue parts should have more clouds and vice versa for the red but i also feel like should mean no clouds
space,not_removed,very neat representation i live in minnesota and my plan for the eclipse is to go to lincoln ne plenty of hotel rooms and other things to do and hopefully go down to st josephs mo they are having what is considered the largest eclipse party in the country for this event httpwwwstjosepheclipsecom hope to see you there if the weather doesnt work for st joseph we are heading west down to good weather
space,not_removed,the western regions are generally more cloudless than the east so just as the map shows the blue regions mostly do have less cloud cover on any given day the scale is clear enough i think zero is no clouds and one takes us to greater cloud cover which is shown as orangered no matter what your feelings of what should be blue in this illustration is cloudlessness and orange is cloudier and despite your feelings the west is as i have said generally more sunny than the eastern united states
space,not_removed,ok awesome perfect explanation thank you man
space,not_removed,the black hole moves too
space,not_removed,it doesnt rip it however it distorts it as long as it is there imagine a tornado moving into a particular direction everything in its path gets either destroyed sucked in hurled away ripped apart etc etc but the air isnt affected anymore once its gone okay maybe a bad comparison in this particular case but you get my drift a black hole is just a very dense and heavy object nothing more but there are gravitational waves that a black hole can send out when there is a really violent event such as a merger of two black holes we just dont understand them well enough yet to be able to perfectly define them
space,not_removed,i think that is what he means if it moves does it not tears space as it moves if so why no telltale signs
space,not_removed,so will a black hole suck in light from both sides they always tell us how big it is but never say how deep it is is the thinness or light years
space,not_removed,because thats not how it works black holes distort the space around them the space goes back to normal after they move
space,not_removed,because thats not how any of this works
space,not_removed,both sides deep thinness a black hole is not imagine it like being a star except that its surface is the event horizon at that barrier gravity is so strong that light cant escape anymore
space,not_removed,but black holes are fundamentally different then stars are they not a star or any object for that matter curves space like you describe as it moves a black hole has an even bigger gravity well but at the center its called a singularity because we dont know what happens with space time there its undefined its a hole in space time hence the name black hole a black hole is not just a denser mass its inside is by definition not part of our spacetime so its basically a tearhole in the fabric of space therefore the question is quite valid i would love to hear an answer from a astrophysiscist or any physicist with the needed knowledge p
space,not_removed,a black hole is not a hole in space time and the singularity means that we dont have data on whats inside them so its easier to think of them as a single point for the math they are not any different really than any other object they just have gravity that is so high that the escape velocity from beneith the event horizon is faster than the speed of light so even light can not escape thus the appear as a hole there is no trail of ripped space time left behind a moving rock any more than there is a star or black hole there doesnt seem to be too much that is special about the speed of light its just a constant space time isnt a fabric that can be ripped persay as far as we know but it can be highly bent and distorted however the only thing that can distort it is energymatter mass if there are neither of those then no distortion you can still get gravitational waves but since they propogate out at the speed of light and since a black hole couldnt move away from them faster than the speed of light there still wouldnt be much of a trail just an area that was once affected by the black holes gravity and now is no longer
space,not_removed,you are misunderstanding what a singularity is pbs spacetime channel on youtube has a great video on it essentially a singularity is simply a point of discontinuity for example the north pole is a singularity as all lines of longitude meet there and longitude is not uniquely defined there in fact it doesnt need to physically exist at all in the latest edition of a brief history of time stephen hawking suggests that there may not be a singularity at the centre of a blackhole at all there are plenty of singularities in mathematics and almost none of them cause a rip in the fabric of spacetime
space,not_removed,not quite the inside isnt observable but as far as gravitational effects on the outside world goes a black holes affects everything around it the same as any massive object so no tears in spacetime trailing behind it
space,not_removed,did hawking not say that theoretically that going into a black hole could propel you to another universe thus physics laws would not be broke with matter being destroyed if this was the case you would most certainly create a ripple in space time picture a piece of paper place a pencil through it and move the pencil you get a rip
space,not_removed,no he never said that at least not seriously suggesting that it were the case in the universe that blackholes were wormholes at the most he speculated that wormholes could be possible if time space was curved and not flat or saddle shaped and that hypothetically you could bend time space enough to touch the other side of the bend this would link both sides the issue is that this would likely just be two black holes not a black hole and a hypothetical wormhole in other words you go in the black hole it links to parts of the universe but guess what youre still stuck in a black hole and there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that this would be possible or exists in any form hawking may have referenced it as a neat idea in one of his public tv appearances because its a fun idea but he would have never mentioned that in his actual work it would get him ridiculed by the scientific community also what about blackholes makes you think they break the laws of physics
space,not_removed,in all seriousness this will end up being like the x prizes where the prize received is largely ceremonial compared to the money spent developing something this is a complicated problem getting solid waste away from someones body without the use of their own hands and in a zerog environment inside a suit that is super complicated
space,not_removed,heres my idea would love feedback now that competition is over
space,not_removed,how about using centrifugal force to just spin the poop to space
space,not_removed,is there a problem with them blurring out their sensitive equipment they arent the only ones to do it
space,not_removed,that is the base of the payload section this maiden launch of the long march is carrying some kind of electric propulsion system for satellites it seems to be more than an ion drive and the payload is several tons later in november they are going to launch some kind of pulsar telescope navigation system this is realizing they also have their quantum entanglement satellite in orbit after that is a supply ship to the space station
space,not_removed,i have to admit this doesnt really bother me much theres no particular reason why china should be comfortable with revealing information that other countries could use to reverse engineer a high tech machine that theyve spent years developing selling launches on a rocket like this one can earn money for the country that builds it theres nothing wrong with protecting your investment
space,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters last usageflight termination system last usagelaunch escape system im a bot and i first saw this thread at nov utc httpdecronymxyz httpsredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
space,not_removed,does anyone else have a low imageviewpoint of the chinese space program based on their history with the long march program it seems like safety isnt a primary concern and that doesnt sit well with me
space,not_removed,the first apolitical and useful comment up until now thanks
space,not_removed,no if safety was the primary concern wed all curl up in our safe space exploration means taking chances
space,not_removed,china is one of the only two nations right now with human orbital launch capability operational and proven the other being russia china has had some reliability problems with the long march which is being phased out by the long march the long march has been the crew capsule to orbit with no problems but long march is replacing it anyway both show multiple advances in fabrication and quality hainan now has spaceports and the chinese seem to be indicating they plan to be the first with orbital space tourism they dont have all the advantages of democracy and politics in their favor
space,not_removed,i dont know how you can say safety isnt a concern when they have an obvious les you can miss the gridfins
space,not_removed,believe that it or not rocket technology is very political it gives a country the capability to reach out and touch anywhere in the world every countrys primary concern is preventing others from touching them
space,not_removed,this is why they had it on their minds its probably the reason its blurred out in the first place
space,not_removed,well theyre the experts after all theyd know how a single photo could be used against them
space,not_removed,i agree however there are precautions a space agency should take to minimize killinginjuring civilians you know such as range safetyfts which is something that the long march program does not employ they just let the rocket go wherever its going to go whether its in an open expanse or whether its a village full of civilians
space,not_removed,they just let the rocket go wherever its going to go whether its in an open expanse or whether its a village full of civilians do you have any source for that because the httpsenwikipediaorgwikihainanwenchangspacecraftlaunchsite is located on a island with nothing but sea to the east which is exactly where the rocket is going after launch
space,not_removed,i presume ulucioghosty is referring to
space,not_removed,i do rescind my previous statement about not using fts apparently thatve finally added that to the rockets the article below reports that they installed a flight termination system about halfway down the page which is exactly where the rocket is going after launch nominally
space,not_removed,yes there were a lot of things that came to light because of that launch disaster their lack of safety features on the rocketsuch as fts but also the poor engineering jobs done and the way they treated their engineers this is all included in the link i included which is also the same link you included
space,not_removed,pretty shitty the way they handled the disaster indeed but i dont believe our western nations really have their hands clean with these types of highlysensitive programmes either although not necessarily in rocketry such as here so they learned from the accident and are now playing by the rules despite their space programme being much younger than many others theyre pretty okay in my book to answer you initial question i have a pretty high opinion of the chinese space programme they are making big strides have determination and the financial means to achieve their goals this is something that often lacks elsewhere infinite money and are ultimately quite open to collaboration sometimes more so than americans see the iss
space,not_removed,what link edit ahh ninjad
space,not_removed,oh ffs you cant be serious you have got to be kidding us with this whenever anybody thinks of terms like safety and openess in space matters or anything else china is basically the polar opposite of that those blurred photos are a prime example
space,not_removed,find an open source project on github and get involved focus on projects that are active been around for more than months and has multiple people committing to the repo if you cant find one that interests you start your own and welcome anyone wanting to contribute
space,not_removed,learn about real time systems theres going to be hundreds of you graduating with web experience be the guy that gets a career not a job learn how to write and document what you do learn about development processes like agile and why theyre important act as if your hobby work is your lifes mission and document it study up on information assurance cybesecurity so youre at least conversant in the topic also from what ive heard about spacex learn to live without sleep just kidding
space,not_removed,try to get an internship at a nasa center next summer i think the application deadlines are typically early in the calendar year so now would be the time to start filling out an application i think the application process is different at each center but heres a link to the one i know of httpswwwnasagovlangleyinternships they do hire on computer engineers in addition to other types of engineers and scientists if youre going to be a rising senior next summer then that is the perfect time for an internship ive known a lot of interns who have later been hired as regular employees i was a supervisor for one this past summer who was hired on at a different nasa center though feel fee to pm me if you have questions source nasa engineer for years
space,not_removed,thank you does it have to be a specific type of project or will any work
space,not_removed,thanks for the advice and when you say document it do you mean publicly like on github
space,not_removed,thank you ill definitely apply once finals are over and ill definitely be in touch regarding any questions i may have
space,not_removed,the biggest thing that an interviewer or recruiter is going to look for is passion and abilityyea it helps if you choose to work on a technology similar to what they are involved in but thats really secondary to passion and drive the most important thing is find something that you will enjoy working on and will help strengthen the skills you want to develop
space,not_removed,if you work on a project write the requirements design and test procedures down and include it with your code to make a complete package people that need to reuse or fix your code will really appreciate it another thought every cs major wants to write code and are reluctant to do the heavy lifting of documenting things one thing ive learned in decades of work is that the sure way to job security is to be willing to do the work others dont want to do good luck
space,not_removed,just wondering is this an actual minute exposure or a series of shorter ones stacked
space,not_removed,its amazing how much everything is moving yet we rarely even notice
space,not_removed,i noticed theres a straight line streaking across diagonally across the top third of the picture is that a plane or a satellite
space,not_removed,the upper part of the image is a minute exposure yes the bottom half is another shot that was like a second exposure with a flashlight pointing back at the camera giving the railing the light it has
space,not_removed,in my experience its typically a plane noticed its dotted because plane lights flash on and off im not sure if satellites do that
space,not_removed,satellites move across the sky so fast you wouldnt notice it in a long exposure picture the reason the stars are so visible is because they stand in one place long enough and planes although they are fast are still slow enough to get some good exposure times not to mention their lights are also significantly brighter for us to see you have the difference between an object moving at give or take and mph give or take i know its about mach vs not even mach a satellite would streak across this picture in about seconds while a plane would take a few minutes
space,not_removed,i want to comment on the dress but all i can think is the backgrond makes it look like your imprisoned somewhere and have made tally marks of how long youve been inside
space,not_removed,i think has the same dress
space,not_removed,this is awesome did you get the fabric specially printed and make it yourself how did you do this i want one d
space,not_removed,sweet thats a really good choice of pattern for a dress you might want to post it also over to httpwwwstartorialistcom blog its run by two astronomers and they collect spacethemed fashion there including photos of real scientists being all cool in their sciencethemed clothes d
space,not_removed,ok since no one else is gonna say it ill be that guy that dress is outta this world
space,not_removed,what has two thumbs and an aweinspiring perspective of the universe
space,not_removed,i thoroughly enjoy how youre immediately recognizable by your astronomer here intro
space,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmwpmqmnngrk
space,not_removed,that dress went out of style about billion light years ago what a faux pas
space,not_removed,ive gotten accustomed to seeing astronomer here and i always get a smile on my face when i spot you on a thread i didnt even realize you were a woman or if id known id forgotten but now every time i read your twoword intro im going to see this dress in my mind godspeed
space,not_removed,nerds havent upvoted an astronomy post this high since black science man made his big bang entrance
space,not_removed,living my dream you go girl im older my folks were very conservative and so even though i was very good at math i was forbidden from pursuing my deep interest in astronomy so armchairing it here and cheering you on
space,not_removed,i really wish astronomers would stop objectifying galaxies on their clothing
space,not_removed,very geek chic i have a question a little out of the fashion field how many full time make enough to eat every day astronomer jobs are there globally i only ask cuz there are a very limited amount of telescopes and only so many customers to require the data
space,not_removed,why is this the top post on rall i dont get why this certain post in hours got points dress is cool but damn
space,not_removed,that looks pretty good id get a tshirt with that pattern if it were reasonably priced i would have to get size xxxxxxl to get so much of the universe on it though hahaha
space,not_removed,those shoes are the shoes i imagined a female astronomer would wear
space,not_removed,thats at the university of amsterdam nederlandse karmatrein naar de voorpagina
space,not_removed,look at my pants with the eyes in your face my legs are covered in outer space space pants
space,not_removed,ah i envy people like you you have found something that you love it must be nice having something thats more than just a job oh and that dress too its awesome
space,not_removed,i have a shirt with tabbys star on it
space,not_removed,nice one ive got a tapestry on my wall with this print now im considering stealing your dress idea
space,not_removed,as much as i am okay with this being here it really shows off the double standard the rules against amateur photography in this sub its basically if the mods dont like your pic and youre not working for nasa then you can f off
space,not_removed,so whats the over under on the number of reddit lonely hearts destroying her inbox confessing their love for her
space,not_removed,the good thing is that you dont have to get too fine a thread count to be accurate to the image due to the hubble fuzz
space,not_removed,why is this on the front page i install elevators for a living im pretty sure if i posted a picture of me in a tux with elevators all over it nobody would give a shit
space,not_removed,that is awesome one of my daughters is very into astronomy science do they and who have kids sizes
space,not_removed,from the hash marks on the wall you appear to have been confined to that room for months give us a signal if you need to be rescued
space,not_removed,am i the only one who cant get why this is on the front page nice dress sure but why so many upvotes
space,not_removed,go to rpics pls if we cant submit our own amatuer work why the hell do you have the right
space,not_removed,what differences would one expect to see in that dress if the deep field wss taken with the yet to be launched jwst
space,not_removed,thats a pretty awesome pattern for some reason my inner nerd makes me think of the eternity character from marvel comics when she appeared at times
space,not_removed,i always wanted to be an astronomer when i was younger but now im going to college for supply chain management
space,not_removed,looks heavenly now but as an astronomer of course youre already aware that the universe is expanding
space,not_removed,what resolution can you get with cotton or whatever the material is
space,not_removed,would make a cool shower curtain for me to poop on nah its pretty cool
space,not_removed,do you see my dress no wait you missed them my dress is a tour of the solar system i know it doesnt entirely work but go with me here
space,not_removed,awesome i start my astronomy class tomorrow in highschool and im very excited about it
space,not_removed,kinda humbling to think were just a speck on someones designer exoskeleton out there somewhere
space,not_removed,just so you can tell all your astronomer friends that its the hubble deep field when they ask about the dress
space,not_removed,oh wow just yesterday i was talking about how awesome a dress with space on it would be i was thinking of a dress with sparkles and one of those overly edited beautiful space shots on it but this looks pretty awesome as well
space,not_removed,omg that is amazing ive loved the ultra deep field since i was a kid where did you get this
space,not_removed,in love with the dress two galaxies to the right and straight on til morning
space,not_removed,billion years later and astronomy girls dress is mostly black with a few speckles
space,not_removed,i like it maybe i can find some of that fabric and make one of my own but with sleeves
space,not_removed,this is awesome did you get the fabric specially printed and make it yourself how did you do this i want one d
space,not_removed,really cool although im a bit curious about what i assume is the radio survey in the background do you have a link to the paper
space,not_removed,the best part is if you ever accidently stain it you can just pretend its a newly discovered nebula
space,not_removed,so awesome my wife high school science teacher has a similar dress with planets that glow in the dark 🤓
space,not_removed,i love the dress the star pattern has a cool random and yet organic pattern to it you look great and kudos to being able to mix work with some fun
space,not_removed,hey buddy eyes up here i was just inspecting your alpha quadrant
space,not_removed,cool svahacom also has a glow in the dark constellation dress with pockets
space,not_removed,post isnt named space dress top comment isnt space dress i am disappoint
space,not_removed,i just took a small trip to baker nevada they have just gotten some sort of international dark sky park certificate or something long story short the sky is amazing there no telescope needed but of course they had a few out if anyone can get to an httpdarkskyorgidspparks id highly recommend it cheap and fun
space,not_removed,thats so cool it looks like i can jump into it like neo did into agent smith
space,not_removed,saw a very similar dress at my favorite thrift store unfortunately it was too big for me
space,not_removed,considering this is my grad student office that is not reassuring
space,not_removed,day theyre still making me do space stuff when will the torture end
space,not_removed,the thumbnail isnt much better day captors have given me an umbrella as a cruel joke because im not allowed out
space,not_removed,from paramount pictures comes the sequel to the thrilling drama the room the space room starring a different brie larson releasing on crackle this october
space,not_removed,i was gonna guess shes inside a giant laundry hamper
space,not_removed,i think she may be trying to sign for help in each hand poor op
space,not_removed,all i can focus on are all those cords she can possibly trip on oh the horror
space,not_removed,i wanted to comment on this comment but all i can see to focus is on is backgrond
space,not_removed,day bored of tally marks moving to doing away with the cross mark you do what you can to stay occupied
space,not_removed,im just disappointed dress sizes are generally odd numbers lest it ring up at the checkout as deep space
space,not_removed,an accurate representation of what the universe looked like to everyone before hubble
space,not_removed,well its nice to know once i get that mobile crafted i have a kickass halloween costume in the works
space,not_removed,ms frizzle had the best fashion ever
space,not_removed,thats actually the fabric of space and time itself
space,not_removed,my mom and i picked it up at macys actually but she had the dress at her place for awhile and only just sent it over we live in different countries
space,not_removed,if it wasnt i would buy one
space,not_removed,wwwbelovedshirtscom make all over printed shirts in otherwords a picture takes up the entire shirt there are some really cool shirts there and you can also customize your own shirt i reckon you could use a picture of the hubble deep field to make one not sure if they have dresses but i own a few of their tshirts and theyre super comfy and durable
space,not_removed,this blog is really not what my budget needs right now
space,not_removed,one of the most niche things ive ever heard
space,not_removed,gahhbank account emptied
space,not_removed,im glad someone mentioned this blog theyre good folks
space,not_removed,i bought my astronomy buff son this beautiful httpwwwhapticlabcomcollectionsconstellationquilts
space,not_removed,damnit dad told you to get off reddit
space,not_removed,at least you didnt make a uranus joke
space,not_removed,id like to put my hubble in her deep field if you know what i mean
space,not_removed,i say space you say dress space dress look at my dress with your eyes that see my body is covered with distant galaxies
space,not_removed,probably the greatest song ever performed
space,not_removed,hahahahah was looking for this
space,not_removed,light years are not units of time i think you mean parsecs
space,not_removed,i havent seen such fashion sense since the beginning of time
space,not_removed,im actually going through a rough patch right now in my research so i do appreciate the kind words thanks
space,not_removed,your references are off the hook man everyone knows that
space,not_removed,yes its sexist and ostracising
space,not_removed,really not many at all ive heard anecdotally there are about of us globally including phd students the biggest general meeting for astronomers in the usa attracts about people annually to give you further context edit for those wondering how to become an astronomer is the post i wrote for my subreddit on the topic
space,not_removed,i am curious about this too space has always fascinated me and my cousin is going to school to be an astronomer but looking at it from a financial standpoint it just doesnt seem like a very logical thing to go to school for
space,not_removed,according to neil tyson there are about astronomers in the world or in a million
space,not_removed,and to add a bit more to the other reply you got not all astronomers need telescope time and of those that do the time spent analyzing the data is typically far more than the time spent collecting it in the field id say for most fields youre probably looking at a small group of people and months of analysis for an few night telescope run we collect a lot of data but then need to process for a while to understand it
space,not_removed,sure that would be the reason to get xxxxxxl
space,not_removed,voorpagina trying to picture this irl
space,not_removed,andromeda is amerikaanse maar woont en werkt in amsterdam
space,not_removed,that reminds me of the time sagan made that comet out of raw earth elements came up wth a little hunk of dirty ice
space,not_removed,ya but its a geek girl wearing a geek dress thats quality reddit posting right there
space,not_removed,the rule is against amateur astrophotography pretty sure this subject was firmly on earth only the dress was out of this world
space,not_removed,dude a tux with elevators all over it would be legit
space,not_removed,glad you found your calling but i think reddits general populace is more interested in space
space,not_removed,if the prime minister of malaysia posted a picture of themselves in an elevatorthemed tuxedo id give it an upvote dont sell yourself short najib
space,not_removed,what if i told you some jobs are cooler than others
space,not_removed,did you try
space,not_removed,cause all due respect space is way cooler than elevators
space,not_removed,it could be that the hubble deep field is slightly prettier than elevators
space,not_removed,not op but its probably custom made
space,not_removed,for one thing the james webb operates purely in the infrared whereas hubble gathers wavelengths both longer and shorter than the visible spectrum
space,not_removed,also my wife has a little dress she wears on evenings out i believe it is a near field view of a black hole
space,not_removed,sorry not a time for jokes but it does look unique i must say please dont ban me
space,not_removed,also sizes bigger due to expansion
space,not_removed,sorry no link im writing the paper still
space,not_removed,ha my wifes office was in the basement of a psychology lab with cinder block walls this is the ritz comparatively it does look like you are in the back end of a big subwoofer cabinet though
space,not_removed,well i guess we know what that new seti signal is just aliens calling in to say you look fabulous dear
space,not_removed,have you seen httpphdcomicscomcomicsphp webcomics before as a masters student i have only experienced a tenth of this but i relate so much
space,not_removed,at least it looks like they got you a sweet chair
space,not_removed,hey its not always bad we have windows in ours
space,not_removed,wouldnt that just be a little black dress
space,not_removed,magic school bus really was a magnificent show educational science shows are the best im glad to see op is now actually becoming ms frizzle irl
space,not_removed,just repurpose httpwwwpotterybarnkidscomproductsplanetmobile
space,not_removed,now imagine the dress actually being the universe and the wearer a higherdimensional transcendent being and this picture being a reaaaaly big photo
space,not_removed,and scientists are saying theyre having a hard time folding the fabric of time and space
space,not_removed,i wonder if its cotton or polyester nylon
space,not_removed,this comment is funny on so many levels
space,not_removed,rosalina from smg confirmed
space,not_removed,haha wat hubble deep field at macys who makes this dress thats awesome
space,not_removed,i need to find this deep field material
space,not_removed,excellent now for homework zoom in and label all of those galaxies
space,not_removed,who is macy do she live near you
space,not_removed,do they have shirts like this as well
space,not_removed,omg do you think its still available at macys so cute
space,not_removed,its like those shirts emblazoned with a super majestic wolf standing in front of a giant moon with intensity color accented pupils heavy native tones possibly featuring a dream catcher you know the alpha dork nerd you went to high school with had like of them unapologetic tack in the shirt form
space,not_removed,you mean there isnt loads of money to be made in space research organizations and governments dont just give away money hand over fist to you p
space,not_removed,you could just send in the picture to post and not buy anything the blog seems too fitting for something like this and im sure lots of people would appreciate how cool if is
space,not_removed,no spacethemed fashion with cats being fucked by dragons and cars is niche
space,not_removed,no need to dress me down in public son thank you folks ill be here all week whether you like it or not goodnight everyone
space,not_removed,wheres uranus
space,not_removed,its the reason hearing is even a sense modality
space,not_removed,parsecs are not units of time i think you mean furlongs
space,not_removed,i know but it sounds good
space,not_removed,i once did the dressel run in under parsecs
space,not_removed,parsecs are also units of distance equal to lightyears
space,not_removed,i understand about rough patches i got my phd in rhetoric instead mainly worked on medieval and renaissance womens rhetorical practice if you ever need a cheering committee pm me i wont get the particulars youre dealing with but i will understand the frustration
space,not_removed,no phd student makes it out without hitting some sort of rough patch
space,not_removed,the harder the struggle the sweeter the victory
space,not_removed,can hobby astronomers help the work of full time astronomers
space,not_removed,total idiot layperson here so please take my dumb question with a grain of salt why do we still need glass and giant mechanics for telescopes isnt there a way to use electronic data to simulate optical magnification
space,not_removed,only thats a much lower number than i thought it would be
space,not_removed,so if i understand correctly there are astronomers that only crunch data and never look through an eyepiece is one position preferred over another does it work like an apprenticeship ie you spend years crunching numbers then you get telescope time thanks for the response
space,not_removed,in elevators no one can hear you scream
space,not_removed,what if i told you thats other jobs are cooler than some
space,not_removed,thats just your opinion man
space,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikispaceelevator
space,not_removed,cool i assume thats a lofar map
space,not_removed,yeah i was in a basement like that during my msc i am in the netherlands now though so there are actually laws about not allowing people to work in places without a window granted no one says the window has to face outside
space,not_removed,yes even have an autographed copy of one of the books which i got from the author when he visited my undergraduate university the one that i discovered this week and really enjoyed though were httplegogradstudenttumblrcom ones mainly because i really like lego
space,not_removed,yeah but thats like
space,not_removed,no excuses fold it mom voice
space,not_removed,its got a thread count thats all im aware of
space,not_removed,i know there is a brand sold on amazon called cowcow i know terrible name for a dress company but they have a dress with space patterns and one with star patterns i have one on order the dresses are nice
space,not_removed,be careful with it we wouldnt want a disruption in the fabric of spacetime
space,not_removed,could be joking but redditors are from all over macys is a big clothing store usually located in malls around america
space,not_removed,only if we say climate change is real

space,not_removed,i would guess somewhere round back but i dont see how thats relevant
space,not_removed,furlongs are not units of time i think you mean leagues
space,not_removed,you should write for hollywood
space,not_removed,yes check out httpswwwzooniverseorgprojects
space,not_removed,there are many ways amateur astronomers can contribute to research astronomy here are some off the top of my head ordered by technical skill the first two only require a computer and internet for the last you really get the opportunity to flex your telescope muscles crowdsourcing technical skill required just be interested mentioned by has a bunch of astronomy projects id like to plug especially httpswwwdiskdetectiveorg since i work with some of those folks they recently published their first paper and some of the amateur astronomers were listed as coauthors this includes the discovery of a new type of star system image processing of the solar system technical skill required photoshop theres a really active community of citizen scientists who have fun doing image processing of data from solar system robots think mars rovers cassini juno they have an awesome forum here httpunmannedspaceflightcom the scientist coordinating them is emily lakdawalla you should follow her on twitter shes great if you have some patience heres a video where she describes the how people on this forum make serious contributions to solar system exploration this is kind of a nice guide to how to get started binary star astrometry technical skill required telescope wizard the httpadusnonavymilwds is an extremely important database of binary stars that are used to calibrate distance measurements on research telescopes as in you know the orbit of the binary so when you look at the binary with your telescope you can measure if your telescope gives you the stars in the right position relative to each other or not and correct for the distortion they rely heavily on contributions from amateurs in their words financially uncompensated double star astronomers as you can see in the acknowledgments section here httpadusnonavymilwdswdstexthtml citizen astronomers contribute by hunting the binary stars and measuring the positions so that the orbits can be updated and made more accurate im pretty sure that hobby astronomers have even helped confirm kepler objects of interest especially now that kepler lost its pointing ability so it cant look at some parts of the sky anymore but i dont have information on that at the moment google is your friend though
space,not_removed,pretty much all of the size has to do not with the electronic data youre right its pretty much all electronic these days but maximizing light collecting area if you do not get enough photons from your faraway object no amount of cleaning the data later is going to get you the details you want
space,not_removed,not an astronomer really telescopes used for research are often not what the average person thinks of when they hear telescope many of them dont even record optical light and many are also not even on earth because as a planet we have a stupid amount of an example of this would be the fermi gamma ray space telescope fgst which has the large area telescope lat as indicated by its name the fgst detects gamma ray emissions from various extragalactic sources it uses a combination of various materials such that when a photon with a specific energy strikes the detector it produces an electronpositron pair that is measured by several layers to determine direction and other information and as you might guess the resulting data isnt really something that looks like typical optical data like some of hubbles data often data like that is viewed in light curves which are more like graphs than the pictures of space that we often see but im no expert so dont take my word for it
space,not_removed,basically what andromeda said but you might like this
space,not_removed,no one really looks through eyepieces in many fields the telescope are actually operated entirely by technicians and you just tell them what to point at and the data is streamed to you many astronomers get data but then spend a long time crunching it what you spend most of your time on is an overlap of what you want to do versus what funding is available
space,not_removed,hence the albert heijn grocery bag how do you like the country
space,not_removed,no outside facing windows become an astronomer they said youll see the vastity of the universe
space,not_removed,i was looking at the background and the chair and i had a feeling you were at the uva turns out i was right
space,not_removed,my entire working life has been in places without windows theyre overrated its really just a distraction mainly because i work in large buildings and the cubicles are internal but i suppose a stargazer would put more importance on being able to look outside its like a weatherman without windows sure most of his work is on computers but sometimes you have to just look outside
space,not_removed,i am in the netherlands now are you originally from spain i ask because more than half the astronomers i know are spanish
space,not_removed,thanks for the link im probably going to binge read through them when i have the time if lego webcomics what you like you probably have already try httpwwwirregularwebcomicnet
space,not_removed,lego grad student made me sort of sad though
space,not_removed,oh it was two years ago when i got it for my kid cuz yknow inflation and global warming and like the internet
space,not_removed,these are so cute and affordable thank you
space,not_removed,that woman looks like shes being forced to wear that dress at gunpoint very cute dress but her face is like please just dont shoot me
space,not_removed,this thread is tailored to suit reddit im sorry i took so many
space,not_removed,climate change is real wheres my dollars
space,not_removed,if you dont you get money from exxon instead
space,not_removed,leagues are not units of time i think you mean siriometers
space,not_removed,ive done quite a bit of galaxy zoo but its very hard to know whether its actually helping anyone or not have you ever used crowdsourced data in your research
space,not_removed,i like it but after five years its time to move on to the next adventure holland has become really normal to me might move back someday though
space,not_removed,you taught me that vastity is a word i will use it today in your honor
space,not_removed,the natural light has very positive mental health benefits that arent immediately obvious
space,not_removed,ive worked with and without windows and id say that working in an office with windows is so much better and definitely not a distraction fluorescent lighting gives damn ear everyone in my office a headache so its nice to shut those lights off and have the sun light the place up instead plus instead of stating at four walls all day i can turn my chair around and stare out at a nice park with some happy little trees the change in weather makes it interesting too long story short windows arent overrated at all but thats coming from someone whose office is basically made of glass
space,not_removed,the building i currently work in has no windows get it together nasa
space,not_removed,no hungarianamerican
space,not_removed,youre welcome im a huge fan they are very collectible
space,not_removed,you get more dollars if you say it isnt real
space,not_removed,siriometers are not units of time i think you mean daleks
space,not_removed,holland had become really normal to me so are you one of those people who moves around a lot
space,not_removed,winter is coming 😭 cant wait till theres a few hours of cloudy light a day s
space,not_removed,thats exactly what i was thinking
space,not_removed,climate change is not real give me that guys dollars
space,not_removed,daleks are not units of time i think you mean hectares
space,not_removed,i guess so i like to travel and moved abroad for my phd because i wanted to be europe based for a year granted i think next place i live will be closer to my family in the usa
space,not_removed,that is my favorite part of winter i burn easily and the sun hurts my eyes winter gives me nice peaceful quiet
space,not_removed,if i say im agnostic towards climate change will i get paid double
space,not_removed,hectares are not units of time i think you mean congii
space,not_removed,tejas the stars at night are big and bright
space,not_removed,go to vermont youll have overcast days from november to march and to top it all off it will be dark by and sunrise at am great for a vampire like yourself
space,not_removed,you only find out what your cheque says after you leave the industry
space,not_removed,congii are not units of time i thing you mean oxgang
space,not_removed,clap cl nope not doing it
space,not_removed,taken by japans akatsuki spacecraft which recently celebrated its first venusian year in orbit around venus
space,not_removed,none of that makes any sense even discounting the fact that nibiru is bullshit you couldnt stop earths rotation with a magnetic field but even if you could suddenly stopping earths rotation would release so much energy and be so violent that everything on its surface would be destroyed being exposed to vacuum doesnt cause things to flash freeze quite the opposite actually vacuum is an excellent insulator so a body would take much longer to cool down even in darkness space suits make use of fullbody liquid cooling systems and radiators to get rid of excess body heat
space,not_removed,theoretical id say more like fantastical theres no evidence that niburu exists simulations and analysis have shown that such an event could not have happened any time in the last several hundred thousand years if ever and if a body that large were close enough to be able to cause a large event within the next millennium it would already have been spotted otoh several cultures have recorded legends of an event similar to the narrative in the old testament of the earths rotation being slowed or stopped for day long enough fir joshuas army to finish off the enemy and we are still discovering things and the moon is probably the result of a collision back when the earth was still molten but that was several billion years ago separately the earths magnetic field has switched poles many times in the past as proved by the different orientation of magnetization of cooked lava rocks of different ages and it is both overdue for another such shift and showing signs of that event already
space,not_removed,thank you my mom just wont quit telling me about the dangers of the planet but i am not the person to be talking out of my ass about something i know nothing about thank you again
space,not_removed,ebullism occurs once your in space you are not insulated in space in space theres nothing to insulate you so eventually youll freeze to death but fortunately that loss of watts of heat isnt all that much compared to the sheer mass of your body you ever notice how long it takes to boil a pan of water or how long it takes for a pile of snow to melt in the vacuum of space youre not turning into a popsicle anytime soon theoretically you dont flash freeze but it is not a insulator fucking idiot
space,not_removed,youve just described an insulator and then declared that it isnt an insulator fucking idiot you know why vacuum insulated flasks use a vacuum right empty space is one of the best insulators you can get it completely shuts down all heat transfer except for radiation thats what an insulator does prevents the transfer of heat what exactly do you think an insulator is why do you think an insulator would prevent ebullism which occurs purely do to pressure and not temperature
space,not_removed,so does the money create a vortex in which the boat can traverse through spacetime
space,not_removed,she forgot the biggest challenge and the impossible one making sure that no earth microbes contaminate mars this is very difficult for robotic missions and basically impossible for manned missions heck there are bags of astronaut poo on the moonit will be much worse on mars
space,not_removed,your comment had me on the floor xd
space,not_removed,sorry but this image is a simulated perspective view of chasma boreale a canyon that reaches kilometers miles into the north polar cap it was created from image data taken by the themis instrument on nasas mars odyssey spacecraft canyon walls rise about meters feet above the floor of chasma boreale httpswwwnasagovimagefeaturechasmaborealeandthenorthpolaricecap
space,not_removed,too bad this isnt genuine but it still leaves me with one question is this simulating the colours we would see or is it enhanced
space,not_removed,heres a higher res version of the image
space,not_removed,this image is a simulated perspective view of chasma boreale a canyon that reaches kilometers miles into the north polar cap it was created from image data taken by the themis instrument on nasas mars odyssey spacecraft httpwwwnasagovimagefeaturechasmaborealeandthenorthpolaricecap
space,not_removed,possibly from what i understand and what im reading online it can be tricky im gonna check the link when i get back to my computer im currently on my phone and on vacation ill be back with an answer thanks regardless
space,not_removed,if it were up to me id send a first manned mission to an area like this certainly the frozen gases im assuming its not water ice probably carbon dioxide ice or sth would be useful in greenhouses or producing or whateveror just burrow into it and set up icecave habitatsyoud think itd be easier to drillablate than stone
space,not_removed,wow this is a real picture from another planet thats kind of mindboggling in itself
space,not_removed,its actually a rendering made from altitude data from the mars odyssey spacecraft
space,not_removed,did they use height maps i did a search for that and the strange terrain on mercury but my googlefu must not have been up to snuff i use height maps in unreal and wanted to get some truly alien terrain
space,not_removed,i dont know much about the details of this stuff but would be useful image its a very high resolution topographic map of mars googling mars bump map also turns some stuff up because link broke
space,not_removed,the gridded mola data is here httppdsgeoscienceswustledumissionsmgsmegdrhtml it is somewhat sparse do to the laser dying early in the mission
space,not_removed,im on my iphone currently but if its a bmp i think i should be able to convert it to a height map thanks sir have some karma
space,not_removed,its a jpg but it can be converted to a bmp right
space,not_removed,it very cpuld be its probably not though but reddit isnt a great place for spam
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,gravitation by misner thorne and wheeler specifically part vi the universe chapter evolution of the universe into its present state
space,not_removed,the holy bible all the answers youll ever need are in it its the only book you should read
space,not_removed,satire right youre being sarcastic
space,not_removed,you science types are all the same you aggressively push your narrow atheistic worldview onto others and dismiss anyone who disagrees with you the lord creating the earth and the whole universe is a whole lot more plausible than something as ridiculous as a big bang from something the size of a pinhead to answer your question yes i was dead serious
space,not_removed,savage troll or just stupid im not sure
space,not_removed,all he did was ask if you were being sarcastic there is nothing scientific about the bible i actually am a believer that there is some higher power but i think you can also believe in god and still be scientific and also still think the bible is a load of shit i dont think god is necessarily an earthlike entity or even an entity at all
space,not_removed,i dont know anything you know just about the same but if theres one thing i do believeno one should believe christianity but hear me out dont freak out or burn me at the stake or throw me in the lake itll be studied as a mythology i wish you would think like me we could make the whole world a better place but youre so hypocritical and all you bring is war i guarantee christianity will be in the futures universities itll be studied as a mythology i guarantee you should listen to me i cant believe that no one sees
space,not_removed,nice very nice thanks for denigrating someone defending the word of your creator and the religion of your ancestors ill pray for you
space,not_removed,im very disappointed to hear that and couldnt disagree more christianity teaches us love and caring the lord works in mysterious ways im sure hell show you the righteous path and youll return to him remember psalm regardless of where you go also know that even though we cant see him we know of his existence because we all feel his presence and are bathed in his light whereas no one has ever seen an atom even the hubble telescope an object of worship for many of you science types has given us proof of the lords existence perhaps you ought to be consulting john and
space,not_removed,the word of the lord is eternal it will still be here in thousands of years long after your bones turn to dust regardless of what you say just read john for proof i feel sorry for you for being so small minded and not understanding that
space,not_removed,i recommend you get space mission analysis and design by jamer r wertz et al they approximate it in the following way m is magentic moment of the earth used in the approximation where r is the radius from the dipoleearth centre in meters to the sc b is then the magnet field in tesla i highly recommend you to look it up in the source i mentioned
space,not_removed,noaa has multiple tools for the earths magnetic field strength at a location and altitude there are probably references to the general equations behind the measurements httpswwwngdcnoaagovgeomagmagfieldshtml
space,not_removed,i was just about to say that
space,not_removed,you cant raise the necessary money voluntarily its just too much nasas yearly budget is still more than all the money ever raised by all projects on kickstarter and indigogo combined for example
space,not_removed,i think we can all agree that nasa is extremely underfunded im going to stop you right there a lot of us think nasa is properly funded and is just wasting money on pork like sls
space,not_removed,spend that on the planetary society your money goes to research and lobbying for greater funds
space,not_removed,and more than other space agencies combinedwhere does that myth of underfunding nasa comes from why always compare it to military and not healthcare infrastructure or education spending
space,not_removed,im sure a lot of you think china is amazing what with launching their old soyuz capsules and old salyut stations you naysayers suck all you want is dinky probes every years and cheap chinese knockoffs of old soviet tech then you go muh taxes muh taxes as if not spending money on sls would get you more science missionswake up and smell the oh you guys clearly dont need these billion a year lets just remove it altogether from the budget it costs money to develop a new capability do you not want super heavy lift launch vehicles why whats your fucking issue and why are you always on this sub talking shit on nasa every fucking day youre just spewing shit left and right of course nothing to say except your little clicks button how cute
space,not_removed,what should it be compared to then
space,not_removed,because reddit is a left wing echo chamber and we will not bring up one and a half trillion dollars spent on healthcare every year
space,not_removed,how would you say that nasas current budget compares to nasas average budget in the in inflation adjusted dollars
space,not_removed,yes everybody who disagrees with you is a stupid commie what a coincidence you and i have httparchiveishibko and this conversation isnt going to change that it costs money to develop a new capability do you not want super heavy lift launch vehicles why the issue most people who dont like sls have is that they feel the capability can be developed for much cheaper they rightly see the billions of dollars in development as being congressional pork especially considering the legacy hardware whats your fucking issue and why are you always on this sub talking shit on nasa im not always but when i do its because i think they can do better and are deserving of the criticism every fucking day youre just spewing shit left and right thats not true
space,not_removed,can you please either raise the quality of your posts or stop commenting on rspace we do not need people who insult those who disagree and misrepresent their points when you disagree please state your disagreement in the form of a well reasoned argument or do not state it at all
space,not_removed,that depends on the part of nasa we are talking about because their divisions are doing vastly different thingsbut in many cases the flagship project of nasa at the moment the exploration missions that encompass the slsorion vehicles should be compared with other launch providersrecently nasa signed a contract for new engines at million a unit while simmilar engines are bought by lockheed martin from russia at mil per unit the current state of the art staged combustion engines in development like and raptor will cost below million per unit ofc is a hydrolox engine but its use is a sign of a deep problem within nasa with lack of risk taking and innovation because they are now left using a a design instead of developing a newer cheaper engine
space,not_removed,lmao ok ill try harder just for you next time
space,not_removed,video of some of the features of orbiter httpswwwyoutubecomwatchveqbcnasbwq
space,not_removed,what about system modeling in this sim are there a lot of switches to learn about like in hardcore flight sims or they are more or less simplified
space,not_removed,i can do all of that and more in kerbal space program not for free though
space,not_removed,theres definitely switches landing gear radiators et cetera but theyre not hard to figure out on the default vehicles theres actually an addon called space shuttle ultra that simulates several elements of the space shuttle cockpit functions apus gpus srms ops oms firings et cetera and is definitely like a flight sim in that regards
space,not_removed,no you cant ksp is significantly different than orbiter example lagrange points
space,not_removed,then dont download it i play kerbal and i love it i play orbiter and i love it too
space,not_removed,i believe harvester put it best when he introduced it to orbiterforumcom this game is not meant to compete with orbiter mind that wouldnt be a good idea anyway to compete with a freeware simulator with years of development on it this is meant to be a different take on space games its not a full blown space sim but its not your average space shooter either at best i hope this can be a stepping stone for people to get into orbiter at worst i hope its at least somewhat entertaining
space,not_removed,awesome technology crappy headline this story isnt about an imminent impact as the clickbait headline insinuates but our new ability to detect asteroids a week before a flyby thats the real newsworthy stuff there
space,not_removed,httpstwittercomminorplanetctr looks much more interesting than the one they reported there announced yesterday it has a diameter of meters potentially large enough to wipe out a city it will pass earth at lunar distances on december things get interesting if the ld estimate is consistent with zero and the diameter estimate is potentially larger than meters
space,not_removed,disappointing thought that meteor wed all been hoping for was finally here
space,not_removed,a week before is way too late though if its not a flyby at that point there will be nothing that we could do
space,not_removed,im not sure a meteor would do such a thing
space,not_removed,think of this advancement in the terms of the prospects of asteroid mining its a significant step forward to be able to detect asteroids of this size while they are a week away from passing rather than just a couple days this more than triples the preparation time we currently have to send a probe maybe even a crew to an asteroid a week might not seem like a lot of time even if you have a launch mission ready to go on standby but the cool thing about scientific advancement is that it keeps getting better were currently at one week but if we continue onward pursuing this technology well keep expanding that launch window to a month three months and eventually the time needed to make planning for a full mining operation on a passing asteroid a feasible opportunity
space,not_removed,true but you could stop working and spend more time with your loved ones that counts as something right
space,not_removed,nasa produced some estimates at a recent meeting which indicated that spacex is spending over million on its proposed mars mission completley inaccurate title for this article not ops fault this is what the heading says but its clickbait
space,not_removed,theres one thing nasa has never been and likely never will be good at and thats estimating costs
space,not_removed,still less than those damn new navy destroyers
space,not_removed,seems like they do something like this to estimate costs
space,not_removed,youre confusing being able to come up with an accurate estimate and knowing when to shove that estimate up your ass and pull another one out so the politicians dont pull the rug out from under you
space,not_removed,and far cheaper than any comparable mars landing
space,not_removed,to be fair nasa found its roots in rockets originally intended for warfare the fear was that if the soviets could send a man in space they could send nukes obviously the cold war is over but you never know what types of science might grow out of the military
space,not_removed,who gives a fuck let them hunt for reds
space,not_removed,sort of the reverse of gravity if youve seen the movie youll know what i mean
space,not_removed,oh you think you heard the iss not the person who originally uploaded the video to youtube back in april and discussed here reposting links to reddit is one thing ripping off someone elses video for youtube revenue is another
space,not_removed,by the way heres the this one is pretty blown out for my taste
space,not_removed,oh shit son its the moon thats flat and the world thats a sphere no way
space,not_removed,incredible imagine what someone living years ago or so would make of this i dont think theyd even be able to tell you what its a photograph of would they have even known the moon in the sky was a physical place that you could go to and stand on would they recognize the pale blue dot
space,not_removed,apollo that was the first time anybody ever left earth with a destination in mind yeah figureeighted around the moon photo of earth rising over the lunar landscape earthrise over the moon there was earth seen not as the mapmaker would have you identify it no the countries were not color coded with boundaries it was seen as nature intended it to be viewed oceans land clouds we went to the moon and we discovered earth i claim we discovered earth for the first time
space,not_removed,ive always wanted this in a wall print but cant find it in a high enough resolution to print
space,not_removed,just to think that this photo at the time contains every manwoman child animal that were alive or dead all creatures of earth had not left this small biome of a rock so they all remained on the planet its like the greatest group photo of all time due to it containing everyone except neil edwin and michael way to be left out
space,not_removed,this was my wallpaper as a kid my folks painted the ceiling dark blue and put glow in the dark star stickers up there it was pretty cool
space,not_removed,since earths diameter is around that of the moon would the earth in the moons sky take up four times as much space as the moon in the earths sky
space,not_removed,i think one of the coolest things about this photo is to imagine staying here for a full day the earth would slightly move position just as the moon does in our sky but the observer would watch the daynight shift across the earth like spinning google earth or any full earth real daytime app that part to me is pretty cool
space,not_removed,why didnt we send a probe like the one we sent to mars to get new pics
space,not_removed,this is better than most of the cctv you see on crimewatch
space,not_removed,the original i love it i remember it from my youth when putting people in space was a regular thing
space,not_removed,i cannot imagine the feelings that went through the astronauts when seeing this for the first time there should be an english word devoted to it like to specifically being the first person to ever see this view of the earth sure a few others got to see it after and maybe like niagara falls you know what youre gonna see because of pictures youve seen before but in person its still emotional but this is the fucking moon no one will ever feel what they got to feel aside from whoever gets to stand on mars first
space,not_removed,i know that dark void is always there but thank goodness we have stars for illumination
space,not_removed,here we are all commenting on a picture of ourselves like one huge group photo mad hi mum
space,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment heres what the earth and moon look like ever further out beyond the orbit of the moon thats actually a cool video i got it from his symposium speech source or theses wise words are from we stopped dreaming by the awesome neil tyson im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
space,not_removed,i had this pic as a mural in my bedroom growing up with grey carpet to match the moon it was awesome
space,not_removed,as astronauts who have been there have stated i wish everyone could grasp the reality of seeing earth this way you would instantly realize how petty and superficial most things are and how fragile life truly is and most importantly we should not be rapping the ever loving hell out of our planet for short sided monitory gains
space,not_removed,no one has mentioned that thats an amazing sight i remember that day as if it were yesterday i guess my generation appreciates that more because it was all so new
space,not_removed,everybody you knew or know is on this photograph i am amazed everytime i see this picture
space,not_removed,in a highway service station over the month of june was a photograph of the earth taken coming back from the moon and you couldnt see a city on that marbled bowling ball or a forest or a highway or me here least of all —joni mitchell refuge of the roads
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,this photo might have been shot with a wide angle lens which kind of makes earth look smaller than it should be
space,not_removed,seeing how the moon is a lot smaller than that of earthhow does the earth become the size of the moon while viewed from the moon
space,not_removed,another fake picture from nasa the earth is flat wake up sheeple slolthesepeoplereallyexist
space,not_removed,theres no way that jupiter will fit in between the earth and the moon along with the rest of the planets no way
space,not_removed,the real question is why when we see pictures of earth from the moon do we never see any stars we see sooooo many stars in the sky when we see the moon from earth
space,not_removed,httpscommonsmwikimediaorgwikifilenewhighresolutionearthriseimagejpgmwjumptolicense its amazing how much bigger our earth has gotten
space,not_removed,the reason it might look smaller is because im pretty sure the moon isnt a perfect circle so some images would look more upclose then others depending on the orbit
space,not_removed,if the air crafts landed on the moon in the center craters how did that manage to get a shot of the moon edge along with earth in it holding chin emoji the moon landing maps shows them landing all arounf inside the moon but non around the edges am i missing something
space,not_removed,if you turn up the saturation n shit you can see that its cropped in do it for yoruself put it in photoshop play around with the contrast
space,not_removed,proof that anyone who says the great wall of china is the only man made object which can be seen from the moon is talking bullcrap
space,not_removed,httpsimgurcomaqhiqg the image rotated degrees
space,not_removed,dumb question where are the stars
space,not_removed,is that australia visible
space,not_removed,udecdec is a complete idiot
space,not_removed,ive been telling these flat earthers its the other way around this photo proves it
space,not_removed,first they would commend the artist on such a realistic looking painting
space,not_removed,source or theses wise words are from httpsmyoutubecomwatchvpubojzwjtlu by the awesome neil tyson
space,not_removed,it really would be nice to have in a proper print
space,not_removed,no it doesnt stop with that meaningless nonsense its like if i took a picture of the ground directly below me and said it contains every person in china thats just now how it works
space,not_removed,had the same mural with grey carpet to match the moon can confirm pretty cool growing up
space,not_removed,it also depends on the focal length of the camera lens you are using ever take a cell phone picture of a beautiful moon and its barely more than a dot thats because youre using a wideangle lens mine has an focal length not sure what that is in equivalent length the lens in your eye has around a focal length equivalent so it may seem small in this photo but we dont know what gear they carried to the moon
space,not_removed,the moon is about half a degree across from earth and earth is about two degrees across from the moon
space,not_removed,lro isnt doing what you described but it is photographing the old lunar landing sites which is cool
space,not_removed,nasa and the us government decided that there wasnt much to gain from new missions to the moon not entirely accurate as the us government didnt see a point so nasa kind of said that there wasnt a point i guess also one of the only reasons nasa was funded to go to the moon was to beat russia there in essence im pretty sure if nasa had way more funding there would be a rover there
space,not_removed,we have just not for new pics there were other scientific priorities some recent lunar missions httpsenwikipediaorgwikilunaratmosphereanddustenvironmentexplorer httpsenwikipediaorgwikigravityrecoveryandinteriorlaboratory
space,not_removed,because its a film camera held by an astronaut who brought the film back to earth all unmanned missions from beyond earth orbit returned electronic images though early unmanned space cameras also shot film which was developed on board and then primitively scanned for electronic transmission back to earth resulting in images similar to sending a photo by fax
space,not_removed,im and it blows my mind that within a little over years we went from the first manned flight to sending people to the moon thats something i would have loved to witness
space,not_removed,no most of the people i know werent born in
space,not_removed,distance most of the photos weve seen recently are from low earth orbit which is between up and up the moon on the other hand is so this photo is taken from away while the photos from the iss are from away
space,not_removed,how in the world would you be able to tell the relative size of the earth from a cropped photograph taken with a zoom lens
space,not_removed,the earth looks far larger here than the moon does to us on earth with that being said its just perpesctive that makes you think its smaller
space,not_removed,when things are more farther they are more smaller too also
space,not_removed,i was just thinking about this then realized that if you look at a scaled version of the moon and earth you will see the vast distance between the two objects one can comprehend how those two objects would grow in size and distance once properly scaled however most people would forget that at such a scale they would not be visible to the naked eye thus if you were at that scale the earth would indeed look pretty large
space,not_removed,the earth should only appear about times as wide in diameter as viewed from the moon as the moon appears as viewed from the earth
space,not_removed,were we having a conversation about this
space,not_removed,its a question of relative brightness first off you see far fewer stars around a full moon than you would see in the same region of the sky when the moon isnt there because the light of the moon washes them out if you take a photograph of the moon unless you overexpose the photograph you wont see any stars there either google photographs of the moon and youll see what i mean additionally when this photograph was taken the sun was lighting up the lunar surface that means it was actually pretty bright when this photo was taken that seems pretty weird because we see the dark sky but the sky is only dark because theres no atmosphere to scatter the light the combination of the light reflecting off the earth and the bright surface of the moon means that if you wanted to take a picture where stars were visible youd have to do a longer exposure which would overexpose everything else in the image
space,not_removed,try taking a picture of the moon and tell me if you can see any stars
space,not_removed,go out and take a picture on your phone of the sky and see how many starts you see in the picture it is all about exposure time
space,not_removed,we see sooooo many stars in the sky when we see the moon from earth yes but thats with your eyes which have much better dynamic range than film take a picture of the moon with the exposure set to properly show details on the moon and you wont see stars if you set the exposure to see stars the moon will be a bright white blob
space,not_removed,theyre on the illuminated side of the moon so theyre being bombarded by light its like why you cant see stars on a sunny day but the sky obviously isnt blue on the moon
space,not_removed,the earth tends to become bigger the more zoom you use
space,not_removed,thats beacuse its fake all fake the earth is actually flat wake up sheep
space,not_removed,of course not its roughly spheroid
space,not_removed,this is taken from the apollo command module which did not land on the moon they are at an altitude of approximately km above the moons surface
space,not_removed,has anyone said that im pretty sure the factoid is that you can see the great wall from orbit
space,not_removed,this is more comfortable to look at but the image before rotation helped me realize the earths orientation after seeing this photo many times i have only just now realized you can see australia if you wanted to keep the north pole upright the original photo would be correct
space,not_removed,wrong degrees i suppose id prefer rolling my head
space,not_removed,in the sky what did you expect the stars to be on the moon real answer you cant see stars because of the light pollution on the moon during day time
space,not_removed,i reckon you forgot the link
space,not_removed,i agree i find it funny hes posting this shit on a platform that uses computers and satellites in space orbiting our spherical earth to achieve it and hes calling it bullshit its like calling gasoline a myth and telling people about it by driving from town to town in a car that uses gas
space,not_removed,but how do we explain to them that the sun is a spaceship with a light on the bottom of it thats the big picture
space,not_removed,respectfully it wouldnt look real to them at all
space,not_removed,thats actually a cool video i got it from his
space,not_removed,its sort of how it works everyone on earth is within the field of view of this camera why does it matter that most are obscured by opaque material were here to mind fuck
space,not_removed,fwiw unless youre in specific areas in chile or argentina china is not directly below you
space,not_removed,brofist or rather nerdfist
space,not_removed,sure we do this was taken on a with a zeiss sonnar mm lens
space,not_removed,i mean its also because the moon is actually relatively small you dont realize it because there arent many points of reference when looking at the sky to compare it to something else
space,not_removed,thats not really what he asked though is it
space,not_removed,this guy knows what hes talking about sarcasm
space,not_removed,poes law ladies and gentlemen
space,not_removed,sfere assuming youre not trolling learn to spell if you expect people to take you seriously
space,not_removed,the distance from point a to point b is the same as from point b to point a
space,not_removed,that doesnt make any sense does it
space,not_removed,youre right i considered the stationary face of the moon and still screwed that up
space,not_removed,the earth would definitely move perceptibly over the month though as it librates because of a slight inclination about degrees between the moons axis of rotation and the normal to the plane of its orbit around earth this causes to be seen from earth now imagine you were on a point on the moon that is only visible half the time you would see the earth repeatedly rise and set on the horizon
space,not_removed,this is probably correct they could send stuff to the moon but since weve been there and the budget is short theyd rather send crafts to new places instead
space,not_removed,oh man what a beautiful data stream i would love to have a recording of those fax sounds
space,not_removed,indeed heres a httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofhumanspaceflightstimeline of manned missions
space,not_removed,right you are i was inarticulate meant moon shots colonization seemed as if the momentum slowed as orbiting the earth was something we did to engage in the race though bruce mccandless is a bad ass imho
space,not_removed,sounds like witchcraft to me got a source on that
space,not_removed,please tell me youre a moonlanding truther d
space,not_removed,no ive just seen stories that say all the planets can fit between the earth and the moon and i think thats impossible
space,not_removed,people like you just wanna watch the spherical world burn
space,not_removed,baaaaa humbug if the earth is flat how can it be night where i live and day in australia when im talking to my internet friend over there i used to work with a guy who wintered at the south pole twice and he had pictures flatearthers say the south pole doesnt exist which stars are overhead and when they are overhead changes smoothly as you travel across the world the towers of the verrazano narrows bridge in new york city are slightly farther apart at the top to account for the curvature of the earth across the span
space,not_removed,good thing the world needs dumb people like you for the crappy jobs we thank you
space,not_removed,thanks for clearing i was getting confused for a second there
space,not_removed,i love getting a decent module never gotten to drive a descent model though
space,not_removed,you cant see it it is far too narrow unless you zoom with a camera then toy can see all kinds of stuff
space,not_removed,if i remember correctly the famous was rotated to fit our worldview of what up and down is the original actually looked httpimgurcomafvnkd
space,not_removed,it also has to do with exposure time think of it this way when you take a picture of the moon from earth so that the moon is exposed correctly do you ever notice stars in your picture the answer would be no here normally a snapshot of the moon for correct exposure would be taken at a shutter speed of of a second for reference when im taking pictures of the night sky and milky way i will usually leave my shutter open for around seconds or so basically the shutter is not open long enough to collect enough light to see any stars to begin with notice in the picture how the earth is exposed correctly and not completely blown out this means that the shutter speed they used was most likely fairly quick so that is why you dont see any stars but even if the astronauts had tried to expose the photo to see the stars they would most likely have just gotten a very blown out picture since the earth and light reflecting off the moon are so bright
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,last time i drove down the rabbit hole i could find no satisfying answer for the optical illusion that the moon looks larger to the human eye but not in pictures when near the horizon
space,not_removed,to be fair the distance between the moon and earth is dynamic it shifts in an elliptical orbit it ranges between km and km
space,not_removed,with budget concerns rapid tech growth and incoming privatization of launches it makes sense to keep current missions more exploratory and inexpensive in nature if we can send people to mars now we can send them safer and cheaper in a few years its frustrating at times but we do have really cool probes and stuff going right now i wish we had a group of people on mars a permanent moon base a few asteroid lasso missions and a europa tunneler going but realistically sadly the political situation wont allow it
space,not_removed,not the exact same set of data but this project is doing basically what youre describing and redigitizing the images httpsenwikipediaorgwikilunarorbiterimagerecoveryproject
space,not_removed,unless youre brazilian then its more like years if the olympics taught me anything is that the wright brothers were scheisters s
space,not_removed,i was kinda referring to now but i didnt make that clear
space,not_removed,my friend told me his name is albert einstein
space,not_removed,i am the truth is that they actually landed on the fuckin moon
space,not_removed,can you help me understand why you think that jupiter diameter miles earth to moon miles seems like a fit
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,actually the eye does have a very hard time seeing faint objects like stars when there is a bright light source nearby go out at night and try to see any stars when theres a street lamp in your field of view this is part of the reason that you cant see many or any stars in the middle of the city if youre lucky and you find a spot where theres no bright lights directly in your view you might be able to see a few of the brightest stars but even just the ambient scattering of the city lights in the atmosphere the light dome of the city is enough to wash out almost everything this is why astronomers preciously protect their night vision when they are doing observations turn the headlights of a car on a bunch of astronomers and you will have a lynch mob on your hands the apollo astronauts all landed on the sunward side of the moon so they could see well enough to work and didnt stay long enough for sunset daylight on the moon lasts for half a month but while orbiting the moon when the astronauts in the command module did spend some time on the night side of the moon they were treated to the darkest view of the night sky physically possible their eyes were fully adjusted to the dark and at their most sensetive and one astronaut described the view as a curtain of white
space,not_removed,they didnt see a huge blanket of stars even for their own eyes its still a problem of relative brightnesseven your bedside lamp is excruciatingly bright when you turn it on in the middle of the night to use the toilet but a better example is standing in your back garden at night when you go out at night you see some stars at first but the longer you stand out in the darknessthe more you see eyes adjusting to the darkness but in answer to did the astronauts see stars yes but not much the apollo astronauts reported being able to see the brighter stars if they stood in the shadows and raised the protective visor its similar to earth we see more stars when theres no full moon the brightness of the moon drowns out the starsand on the moon the earth is alot brighter than a full moon so alot of stars are drowned out in the relative brightness of it i believe the iss astronauts report seeing huge blankets of stars at the times there away from the sunearth etc
space,not_removed,this guy is probably trolling but the unironic flat earthers have some ridiculously complicated discandtinysun model they like to trot out it doesnt even adequately explain all of the phenomena that point to a spheroidal earth but theyll misunderstand the fundamentals of physics and argue with you for hours about it anyway hell its not even difficult to demonstrate that the earth is curved without any external tools go to the beach or the prairies or some other place where its flat all the way to the horizon lie down and watch the sun set as soon as it sets stand up and watch the sun set again now travel the world proving over and over that everywhere you go the earth is curved calculate the curvature with sticks if you want
space,not_removed,yes i know you cant see it a factoid is a commonly spread fact that is actually false in fact the one about the great wall is prominent on the wikipedia page for factoids
space,not_removed,ok thanks i was confused because i was thinking there is no atmosphere on the moon to even block the stars
space,not_removed,the only one that ever helped me try to understand it was just getting scale from the ground and trees ive heard some people say that when its closer to the horizon the light is passing through more atmosphere and it could act like a lens but im not buying that itd make that big of a difference im still curious though
space,not_removed,ive honestly never experienced that optical illusion so i couldnt help ya
space,not_removed,just tell them that we can get a ton of gold from the moon asteroids europa and wed get it just dont tell them that would drastically lower the price of gold with an alien influx its all good
space,not_removed,looking at the picture it does not look like miles
space,not_removed,i have a surveyors transit for engineering purposes and used to own acres of forest land i can measure the curvature of the earth just across that piece of property a transit very accurately tells you what is horizontal but horizontal isnt the same direction on a curved surface so i dont have to depend on any secondary sources ive measured it myself the problem with people like the flatearthers is they get their information online instead of going outside and checking for themselves
space,not_removed,i think the illusion does not show up in pictures so that means it would have to be within our visual system and rules out any atmospheric effects
space,not_removed,its a strange one usually for me i only notice when its very high in the sky and it looks tiny
space,not_removed,so uh what does it look like ballpark it
space,not_removed,that photo was taken with a long focallength zoom lens taken from a similar perspective see how much farther away the earth looks heres a httpiimgurcomxhkcndmhjpg also taken with a wider angle lens and heres the all the planets of our solar system
space,not_removed,yeah makes sense ive never bought into the atmosphere explanation i honestly think its just that when its up against trees and buildings there is something for our brains to compare it to when assigning a size we know its far away and we know how big it is in comparison to the trees next to us in the sky its all arbitrary though
space,not_removed,wow thanks for putting all the information there that really is amazing
space,not_removed,because the only system we ever built to do so had limited capabilities in terms of colonization or reducing ongoing costs or difficulties of lunar flights or lunar stays and yet it still had an enormous price tag of around one billion dollars per crew member that was obviously not sustainable so the system was abandoned and unfortunately all the core systems used for the flights especially the saturn boosters were also abandoned in favor of dumping development funds into the space shuttle moreover theres not much reason to go to the moon again other than just to say weve done it again lunar bases would be extremely challenging to build and operate due to the dearth of local resources and the extremely hostile local environment wild temperature swings extremely abrasive lunar dust lack of consistent solar power lack of sources of watercarbonnitrogen and other key components of human survival on most of the lunar surface etc at the end of apollo wed only modestly increased our capabilities in regards to surface stays on the moon up to a few days and we hadnt built any lasting infrastructure to make it any easier or cheaper to go back so we didnt landing on the moon with our current level of technology really only has relevance in so far as the moon happens to be the closest planetary body to earth otherwise the combination of difficulty cost and lack of justification would keep us away if the moon were more like mars with several local resources available for use by early explorerscolonizers such as water a near hr daynight cycle sand nitrogen iron etc etc etc then we almost certainly would have begun colonizing it back in the as it happens mars is much further away and still requires a significantly costly series of bootstrapping missions and rd to make it possible to bring ongoing colonization operations down to a costeffective level consider for example that they could probably be done today after the initial development efforts for an ongoing expense of perhaps billion a year or less maybe even half a billion a year versus a billion a ticket for a few days stay
space,not_removed,government shortsightedness is one reason i firmly believe albeit with absolutely no technical insight at all that if we had of continued with the moon missions we would already be on mars
space,not_removed,there are some signs of a moon renaissance approaching fortunately largely from esa but also nasa and the chinese space program are looking into a lunar return last i heard the russians cancelled their tentative plans due to economic woes rmoonbases has some links to articles about the various proposals
space,not_removed,what is the reason we should fly to the moon we didnt forget anything there
space,not_removed,i firmly believe that once space companies across the board start taking reusability seriously a la spacex then we will see an overall drop in the price of access to space and once that occurs far more frequent missions to the moon with unmanned probes and eventually with people once again spacex has made it clear that the reason they exist is to open up the feasibility of colonizing the planet mars as also stated by elon musk founder of spacex there is no reason that once the mars transport architecture is in place mission to the moon wont also be on the table for example if nasa wants to pay spacex to put astronauts on the moon for months and bring along with them the survey equipment science experiments supplies and machinery theyll need theres no reason spacex would refuse in fact i can see something similar to the commercial crew program where nasa awards spacex a contract to do say ten flights to the surface of the moon the first three being unmanned with cargo only and subsequent flights rotating out crew members and supplying additional cargo such a commercial moon base contract would be far cheaper than any moon base architecture currently on the table and would result in an actual facility on the moon with at least some isru capability for example printing large inhabitable structures from fused lunar regolith harvesting oxygen by electrolysis of alumina as well as affording a much more in depth and large scale survey of the resources on and under the surface of the moon for example what if we find out that ten meters under the surface there are actually vast amounts of hydrated minerals meaning water on the moon isnt as rare as we now think it would be a game changer maybe well find minerals containing carbon as well maybe we just confirm present theories that say the moon is a very dry place in any case im sure well find something we didnt expect and learn far more than we ever could by doing remote scans from orbit with probes
space,not_removed,simple answer is that it takes the biggest most powerful and most expensive rocket ever built to send humans to the moon and back to do what exactly pretty much the same thing theyve already done times before its much less expensive to send robotic craft to study things since robots dont need things like oxygen food water space toilets comfortable temperatures or a flight back home
space,not_removed,china is on the moon right now they will be back on earth in the second half of why does it say comments but i only see one
space,not_removed,there would be only one reason to go back natural resources and nasa isnt in that market for those that is going to the moon is a risky and expensive endeavour
space,not_removed,because our most recent extremely expensive attempt was a failure the committee judged the old constellation program to be so behind schedule underfunded and over budget that meeting any of its goals would not be possible president obama removed the program from the budget effectively canceling the program httpsenwikipediaorgwikireviewofunitedstateshumanspaceflightplanscommitteefindings
space,not_removed,anyone remember when bush was running for president in that he said he would put a man on mars in years well hes a big part of the reason
space,not_removed,ugh httpswwwnationalprioritiesorgcostof i wish wed have spent it on space hell even of it could have done so much james webb is what so by the figures on that link since we could have built james webb space telescopes using only a tenth of that money and thats just the united states cost sigh
space,not_removed,colonizers such as water well the moon does have water it is estimated to have something like billion us gallons of water locked up in craters in the northern polar region alone
space,not_removed,taking a chunk out of the defense budget and putting it towards the space program would be a good start we already hitch hike with the russians as it is
space,not_removed,studying reduced gravity on humans exploring construction techniques in reduced gravity exploring manufacturing techniques in reduced gravity far side of the moon would be great for radio telescopes identifying optimal plant species for both oxygen exchange and food in fractional gravity testing various construction methods and materials for optimal radiation shielding for colony modules explore processing native materials for use in colonies billions of gallons of water in the northern polar region on the moon etc all with earth days away and light seconds away for nearlyrealtime communication pulsed light could even be used for effective broadband with a really shitty ping speeds for data transmission
space,not_removed,pretty sure op means human manned missions not robotic ones
space,not_removed,why does it say comments but i only see one accounts below a certain threshold require approval to prevent spam could also be shadowbanned folks commenting
space,not_removed,also youd have to find something to do with those natural resources to be worth the expense even mining probably isnt feasible given that we can just make the stuff on earth
space,not_removed,yeah well legacy government contractors are suuuuper expensive to even have design an ashtray lockheed martin and its competitors for other stuff get away with murder when it comes to pricing theyll gouge on government projects then throw all the money at their own experimental stuff that isnt contracted out like their quantum computing program then theyll shut down an office and let all the people go or sell off a subdivision to a competitor at the drop of a hat like in september of they bought a company and two months later closed a plant and laid off people at another one of their divisions earlier that year theyd bought another company theyve also been investigated umpteen times and paid out settlements for lying on government bids and for corruption thats why i like these smaller newer companies like spacex getting in on it they arent run by former politicians and former military and arent expecting obscene amounts for what should be affordable projects like the legacy contractors lockheed martin space systems has had their hand in pocket book of the usaf nasa and several ogas since the doing satellites space shuttle tanks space probes missile defense networks and even the gps network you get stagnation and lack of innovation you get absurd inflation of price hopefully more companies like spacex get their own stuff operating without direct input from the government and the government either uses it or goes hey give us a proposal for something that meats a b c and z that we want
space,not_removed,to be fair its only a presidents fault when they say no to something nasa makes their own decisions congress gets to approve or deny programs they also get to approve or deny budgets and lets face it there arent a whole lot of lobbyists throwing around money for us to go to mars there are a lot of lobbyists throwing around money for weapons systems and armor systems medical tobacco agriculture firearms etc those industries are lucrative and can afford lobbyists space isnt very lucrative there are something like medical industry lobbyists for every senator for every senator and thats just the medical industry lobbists httpwwwfacethefactsusaorgfactspowernumberslobbyistshavecongresscovered for senators thats lobbyists per senator i imagine precisely zero of them were for space
space,not_removed,imagine if you connect all of them together
space,not_removed,billion us gallons or billion litres which is about litres for each of the billion people on earth who have no idea wtf a us gallon is
space,not_removed,taking a chunk out of the defense budget and putting it towards the space program would be a good start looking at httpswwwnationalprioritiesorg the dod budget annually could provide billion watts of pv panels assuming per watt split it between solar and wind and every household in the us could have renewable energy or we could fund james webb space telescopes a year at the current price tag sigh
space,not_removed,we already hitch hike with the russians as it is which is a tad embarrassing
space,not_removed,now its all fine and dandy but do you have the time the money and the technology to safely and reliably perform all that in say next years probably probably not there are many more important things to take care of
space,not_removed,out of those only the radio telescopes deliver a direct benefit studying stuff is all very well but what is it then going to deliver once its done that will justify the billions that would need to be spent if we learn to build stuff from lunar soil for example what would we then do with knowledge we could build a moon base but what would come out of that in the face of budgetary competition from everything else that places demands on the state those are the kind of questions that need to be answered so that a project like that can be sold if you can show people how they can make money by going to the moon youll have governments and corporations queuing up to do it
space,not_removed,they plan do send humans in which given their progress seem to be fairly realistic most likely the first human to land on the moon in xxi century will be chinese much like the first lunar lander and rover in xxi century were are chinese
space,not_removed,i hear ya but im afraid mr putin would want to dance with us if we gutted our budget
space,not_removed,if you look at the defence budget since youll see that its gone through a fairly sizeable reduction that money didnt end up paying for space stuff and actually without the huge military spending on rocketry during the there wouldnt have even been the technology to kick off the space race in the least of all go to the moon the cash would end up paying for social security healthcare infrastructure policing etc etc because those are much higher up the priorities list for most politicians and voters
space,not_removed,httpswwwnationalprioritiesorgchartspartialtaxes while cents of every dollar was spent on the pentagon the military was spent on general science research and space flight research and activities while nasas budget we very much have the money billion dollars landed men on the moon and returned them not using reusable craft using computers the size of buildings with terrible battery terchnologyno pv powermodest rtgs we have the technology to get to the moon we had it decades ago weve landed suvs on mars curiosity is almost feet long we are testing an inflatable habitat on iss right now in years we will know if its viable for use theres something like billion us gallons of water locked up in craters in the northern polar region alone which with pv powered electrolysis would provide plenty of hydrogen and oxygen for inflating the bits of the module that arent occupied the walls as well as provide plenty of water for hydroponics and consumptiontoiletries it could also be melted and poured into air tight compartments to act as radiation shielding material to place around the habitats all of this stuff is ready now we are working on better technologies and craft a reusable shuttle could easily be developed to transport personnel to and from the moon robotic craft could land everything that would be used for the habitats the beams the inflatable module mass is approximately pounds putting it at on the moon meaning a single man with a engine cherry picker hoist and modestly powered wheels could move the modules to where they need to go to be inflated
space,not_removed,out of those only the radio telescopes deliver a direct benefit all of them deliver a benefit we dont construct things outside of earths gravity if we ever become a space fairingcolonizing civilization its something we are going to need to learn how to do fractional gravity wont matter with some construction and fabrication methods but very much will change the way some happen
space,not_removed,we dont have to gut it reduce it throw that towards space most breakthroughs in space technology will have military applications improvements in satellites and things like james webb will also improve military satellites rocket advancements will allow the military to also put larger things in orbit improvements i orbital craft might translate to future military aircraft
space,not_removed,the cash would end up paying for social security social security is funded by its own tax
space,not_removed,a radio telescope is useful in itself whereas the others are about developing technologies that could be useful if we go on to build moon bases and the like i think there is value in knowledge of any kind even if we dont end up using it because it can often tell us the path we shouldnt take but getting other people to pay for it is a lot easier if you can point to a direct and valuable end result the way big rockets were developed came about because it meant that the us could nuke the ussr before any soviet bombers or missiles could take out the american deterrent there was a clear mission and payoff and politicians were willing to put up the money its harder to do something similar with civilian space research but there must be saleable ideas out there
space,not_removed,my mistake it would go into other welfare spending then i didnt know whether ss was hypothecated in the us
space,not_removed,if we go on to build moon bases and the like if we go on to build or mine anything in space other than a planet or body with less gravity than earth
space,not_removed,i didnt know whether ss was hypothecated in the us yeah the employer pays and the employee pays similarly the employer pays for medicare as does the employee self employed persons pay all they get to stop paying half of it after a certain income level its north of i believe but get to deduct the employer half
space,not_removed,dont you think that that headlines a little too bold for what info we have at the moment
space,not_removed,is slightly processed version to remove the small bright blemishes due to cosmic rays and charged particle radiation near the planet a more aesthetically pleasing image but with a slight softening of the finest details
space,not_removed,why wouldnt they use the atmosphere to deorbit if the probe could skim through the cloud tops at periapsis several times before slowing down to a suborbital trajectory wouldnt that give them more data
space,not_removed,httpswwwnasagovmissionpagesstationresearchresultscategory well that took about seconds in google
space,not_removed,i think it has been important to study the effects of longterm spaceflight on humans and also build up the technology needed for sustained human presence in space it may not have been done in the most costefficient way but we should make use of it while its still up there thanks to iss we now have companies like spacex and bigelow who could take over leo spaceflight within the next decade for tourism and scientific purposes meanwhile nasa can move on to planning their mars flights though im sure private companies will also play an important part in that as for probes vs humans both have their upsides robots are better at collecting data but space should eventually become a place where people go to work and live i think thats a more exciting future than only focusing on pure science its the only way to ensure our longterm survival because no matter what we do earth wont sustain us infinitely
space,not_removed,people always say that the iss has generated less important stuff than unmanned probes and it is less efficient but they always seem to be interested in human related breakthroughs which do not come from unmanned probes we learn much about how our bodied operate on earth when we taken them out of it and supporting them in space allows us to develop systems which if need be could be used to suppot us on the earth while funnelling money and jobs into the high end aerospace market creating thousands of jobs unmanned probes discover amazing things about the other planets and the galaxy and beyond and i think they are incredibuly important but they dont teach us anything about the human body
space,not_removed,many contractors have made a lot of money and many people have been distracted from the fact that nasa isnt anywhere near going to mars
space,not_removed,do you feel like any of the work done in your second link is meaningful my concern is we spent billion dollars on the iss and i cant name a breakthrough even with your handy list of studies my concern is we spent all this time and money when we should have been looking further out than low earth orbit with unmanned probes would you agree with the statement we should shut down the iss and focus on unmanned exploration or human to planet exploration or focus the next billion on more missions like the iss
space,not_removed,science isnt about chasing the next breakthrough its usually incremental improvements when it comes to unmanned exploration versus manned research or more generally pure vs applied research thats just a personal value judgement where everybody will differ i could make opinions like research on iss will be more imminently applicable to us than exploring the atmospheric composition of uranus yet you might feel otherwise and neither of us would be wrong personally id like to see us end our outrageously expensive foreign wars and reinvest that budget into all forms of science research our wars have been more expensive than iss if wishes were horses
space,not_removed,if you want useful scientific breakthroughs you want manned spaceflight apollo had many when we finally go to mars there will be many nasa should reprioritize not to probes but to long duration human exploration of space similar to scott kellys mission spacex gets it they may be overly ambitious but then again wasnt jfk when he promised the moon after minutes of american spaceflight
space,not_removed,im pretty sure most asteroids could collapse the world economy if you aimed them right
space,not_removed,so you forgot to mention that it could also solve any issues we have with mineral scarcity bunch of pessimists up in here
space,not_removed,why do they always insist that an asteroid would destroy the economy they cant dump the entire contents of the asteroid fast enough in the proper form to do that it will take years of mining shipping and refining to put the contents of the asteroid on the market then theres the silly notion that the worlds debts need to be paid off most sovereign debt is not like a credit card it is simply money owed in the future this isnt a bad thing
space,not_removed,could we also solve hunger and end world war and famine with this kind of wealth untold or would it be like the proverbial year old that comes into millions of inheritance and promptly becomes a heroin addict
space,not_removed,can we just divert the heading of it so it can come pay us a visit
space,not_removed,psyche tess jswt and atlast are doordie missions for us they must succeed if we want to stake a claim in the universe
space,not_removed,nope that is not how it worksjust sudden abundance of some materials and its price decrease would make solutions using them more popular simmilarly to how in early xix century aluminium was more expensive than gold but once more efficient production was invented its price dropped like a rock
space,not_removed,if nasa scientists were more accurate spitzer wouldve died years ago this line confused me do they mean accurate in their predictions of lifespan accurate in construction or accurate in where the craft flew vs where they aimed it to fly i dont see how any of these would result in an earlier end to the telescope if they were more accurate
space,not_removed,they estimated the lifespan of the craft due to nasas ingenuity in making the increasingly broken craft continue to function that estimation has turned out to be inaccurate
space,not_removed,ive just realised what it is the word more shouldnt be there
space,not_removed,the fact the op starts with a conclusion then proceeds to a question is only more evidence of this strange backwards dyslexic logic that so many kids have today those photos got spread and changed a thousand times the day they were released from nasa the images not photos were imaged on that day straight from the space probe wherever that image was downloaded from somebody hadnt checked their pc clock in awhile and the file got time stamped seriously this is as stupid as thinking the cd tray is a coffee coaster here is one from business insider check the time stamp on that
space,not_removed,well you arent seeing the raw files from the spacecraft lorri images at least are bit not bit at some point the files went through a computer that stamped a date on them why i dont offhand know could have had its date set wrong or there could have been an issue with the software
space,not_removed,wrong date on a computer opened an old file and added new data to it in the referenced video they are looking at xmp data of a psd as nasa doesnt send around psd or jpgtiffetc from spacecraft to earth this isnt a source file so the data has been run through some conversion utility that probably spits out tiffs or psds just a guess maybe that conversion utility was written or last updated years ago but nah im sure nasa and a whole slew of contractors are all in in a conspiracy to actively lie to us about our solar system also massive hour gap has this man never opened a file gone on to work on something else and then returned to finish working on it
space,not_removed,i dont have experience with photoshop but i think this is how it went down nasa releases a lot of images that come to them in crazy space formats but internet takes jpegs and pngs and so they have to convert them some pro active intern made himself a script or a template in ps to automate that process in and so every immage he processes is stamped with that date because he is using some old file as a template
space,not_removed,lets say it was the pc clock why wouldnt nasa check these images to make sure everything is technically correct with them including the metadata before release i mean its nasa they arent stupid something doesnt add up here
space,not_removed,somebody tampered with their computer clock to extend the trial period on a shareware picture editing software is my guess i know its nasa and they could just buy a license but people dont work that way
space,not_removed,because the earth is really flat and nasa is a bunch of liars that are trying to trick us
space,not_removed,i get what youre saying here which kinda checks out but to have a computers year set wrongly can you even set time manually anymore
space,not_removed,thats what ive been thinking too i dont see why theyd go to that bother
space,not_removed,yup new horizens was launched in expect a bunch of legacy systems and a fair amount of linux
space,not_removed,thanks post saved so i can check it out when i get home
space,not_removed,that image is from the iss not the space shuttle
space,not_removed,do you mean a grounding strap and yes static does still build up in space
space,not_removed,my bad i actually meant the iss before posting the question i did a google with the term iss i have no idea why i said space shuttle here
space,not_removed,static is actually a fairly dangerous thing to deal with in space and it builds up extremely quickly even the new ida installed on the station includes things like power data and a groundearth connector so there are no surprises
space,not_removed,earth straps grounding straps same difference in my years in the electronics industry ive never heard someone call them a grounding strap not that disputing that people dont call them grounding straps just earth strap is the terminology that we use where im from also im not asking if static builds up at all
space,not_removed,mhm sure source and i dont consider some esosite that wants to sell me an orgonaccumulator or a pyramid which sharpens my razorblades when put inside it a valid source btw real space sikness httpsenmwikipediaorgwikispaceadaptationsyndrome
space,not_removed,american here everyone in my tech related field calls em grounding or ground straps too
space,not_removed,im in canada and in my pc hobby ive always heard them referred to as grounding straps
space,not_removed,from the us never heard it called earth strap always ground
space,not_removed,good job
space,not_removed,where are you located
space,not_removed,i must say that in the next years exoplanets are going to be the most exciting field each year we are getting closer and closer with more detailed images and with james webb telescope the futures looking bright and filled with exoplanets
space,not_removed,this isnt a jab at you op but i really hate x things you didnt know about blank headlines they just irritate me
space,not_removed,fta when apollo lunar lander the eagle separated from the orbiter the cabin wasnt fully depressurized resulting in a burst of gas equivalent to popping a champagne cork it threw the modules landing four miles offtarget not entirely true while the apollo lm eagle did land almost miles away from the targeted touchdown point in the sea of tranquility this was not primarily due to the excess in the docking tunnel between the csm and lm hatches pushing the spacecraft off course at the time of separation in lunar orbit that landing site in the sea of tranquility neil and buzz actually touched down at was not even close to the predesignated landing site location at the center of the landing ellipse that they were supposed to touch down at which was a huge reason for the fuel concerns just prior to final touchdown the fuel concerns are briefly mentioned in point of this same article op posted in fact in terms of distance apollo landed much further off target than any of the other five apollo lunar landings combined nasas official name for the apollo landing site was given the preflight designation of landing site for mission g which was a landing ellipse target area in the sea of tranquility that was miles wide by miles long about kilometers long east by west and kilometers wide north by south at the time of pitchover when armstrong and aldrin got their first look at the landing site from the lm spacecraft windows they were very close to being right on target for their planned preflight initial approach and touchdown location however during the final descent phase of the landing as they got closer to the lunar surface armstrong was forced to take manual control of the lm slow the descent and then deliberately travel considerable cross and downrange distance and manually fly the spacecraft over the lunar surface in order to avoid a massive boulder field and several craters that were in their designated landing area obstacles that did not appear due to camera resolution issues in the preflight remote sensing landing site imagery shot by the prior lunar orbiter imaging probes or in the high altitude standoff frames of the landing site taken during the previous apollo landing dress rehearsal mission this manual maneuver forced neil and buzz to fly almost miles further downrange west and crossrange south from their original planned landing point until neil armstrong could finally find a surface area that was flat enough and devoid of boulders and craters so he could comfortably land the lm it was because of this extra required maneuvering during the final approach phase that the lm descent stage fuel load started dropping close to the critical range just before touchdown causing the crew to come somewhat close to forcing an abort declaration and escaping back to lunar orbit the fuel load of the lm at touchdown was not as low or severe as many in the public think it was or as the cockpit and mcc voice chatter audio recording of the landing makes it out to be but that extra maneuvering by armstrong during that final phase still caused a hefty amount of concern in mission control on earth as they watched their telemetry showing the fuel load quickly dwindling as the lm was still in flight above the moon while the slight pressurization that existed in the docking tunnel at the time of lmcsm separation slightly altered the velocity and initial approach timing and altitude numbers for the lm as it came down towards the sea of tranquility the primary reason the apollo lm landed so far away from the preplanned landing site and the reason they burned so much more fuel in the lm descent stage than expected was due to the extra surface obstacle avoidance maneuvering and added hover time that armstrong had to carry out in order to locate a safe obstacle free landing spot
space,not_removed,i suppose constipation is a small price to pay for going to the moon
space,not_removed,there was an article i read some years ago that mentioned that postflight the engineers concluded that the lowlevel propellant light came on seconds early and that obviously level of thrust has much to do with it also from memory i think that the countdown of fuel was to the abort point not the actual fuel remaining
space,not_removed,absolutely correct when nasa had a chance to really pour over the telemetery it was determined that the apollo crew definitely had significantly more fuel left aboard at touchdown in the descent stage than the callouts we heard during the landing seemed to show this was even appreciated as being the case during the final approach landing itself the apollo crew during the final approach and touchdown phase certainly did not have a lot of fuel to play around with but the truth is that because of builtin contingencies in the flightplan and known fuel slosh issues that would slightly mess with the realtime tank fuel level measurements and the illumination of the low quantity light they definitely had considerably more than to seconds remaining in the tanks which many in the public erroneously believed to be the case firstly the apollo missions had a safety margin built into their fuel loadout calls during landing requiring that the lm had at least six full seconds of thrust available in the dps descent propulsion system tanks left over after the zero fuel call what was known as bingo fuel was reached this six seconds of full throttle capability at the callout was there in order to allow the crew to perform a stabilization maneuver to nullify any forwardbackward andor lateral velocities and execute an aps ascent propulsion system abort six full seconds of thrust was certainly not required for an aps abort during the landing phase the lm did not hover or land on thrust the real throttle percentage figure was much lower than that closer to throttle and because the thrust percentage needed to successfully abort via the aps was considerably lower than the sixsecond margin provided the actual contingency flight time given for the abort maneuver or to continue powered descent at much less than full throttle using the dps engine was in reality greater than six seconds after the flight telemetry examination determined that due to fuel slosh issues fuel moving around in the dps tanks the low propellant light in the lm cockpit illuminated between and seconds earlier than it should have which erroneously signified that the fuel quantity was lower than it actually was internally nasa was well aware that the apollo lm landed with somewhere between to seconds of usable descent fuel left in the dps tanks the reason the public quickly latched onto the seconds of fuel left over claim was because of the radio calls from mission control coming in over the open loop during landing which by design did not take the well appreciated contingency load of fuel in the tanks and the fuel tank slosh issues into account had armstrong and aldrin been at bingo fuel with just a couple dozen feet to go before touchdown in a stable attitude nasa would not have ordered an aps abort and armstrong and aldrin most certainly would not have conducted an abort on their own because they were all well aware of the contingency load and slosh issues that gave them at least another seconds of throttle and engine life to reliably play with to execute the landing
space,not_removed,one of the shots in this video made me wonder about the possibility of finding caves on mars is it possible to have caves on mars
space,not_removed,there isnt enough emphasis put on the number of incredible life altering technologies that come out of the development phase of missions like these the list of tech that came from the mercury and apollo missions is staggeringthe world would be a completely different place if the space race of the never happened if my government is going to waste our tax money let them waste it on developing solutions that will make humanity spacefaring somewhere down the line
space,not_removed,the list of tech that came from the mercury and apollo missions is staggeringthe world would be a completely different place if the space race of the never happened if my government is going to waste our tax money let them waste it on developing solutions that will make humanity spacefaring somewhere down the line this is not convincing to me its possible that someone would have come along and developed those technologies even if nasa didnt its like the first guy to walk by and pick up the dollar off the ground theres nothing special about him and if it wasnt him the next guy would have come along and done it you are ignoring opportunity cost its cheaper to develop technology without a massive bureaucratic organization dumping rocket stages into the ocean between the funding and the final product i like spaceflight but this particular line of reasoning is not at all persuasive
space,not_removed,imho the journalist is clueless about orbital mechanics with all due respect to blue origin they arent even close to replacing nor soyuz neither atlas
space,not_removed,olympus mons is a shield volcano it doesnt produce ash or pyroclastic flows its just nice effusive lava
space,not_removed,the prevailing theory on why mars is so inhospitable to life has more to do with its lack of a strong magnetic field than any past volcanic event
space,not_removed,could be wrong but the soil doesnt have volcanic stuff in it as far as i am aware i dont think that volcano could have had that kind of power again i could be wrong
space,not_removed,if the surface of mars would be covered in volcanic ash we would already know that
space,not_removed,on another note how much greenhouse gases could shield volcanoes like olympus mons and the tharsis montes have emitted into the martian atmosphere by themselves enough to substantially raise the temperature just curious
space,not_removed,all of the modules are attached when leaving the iss from what i know the soyuz capsule seperates roughly minutes before landing which translates into being roughly in altitude this gives the orbital module and service module enough time to drift away from the descent module after the explosive bolts have been fired to seperate them only the descent module survives reentry as the other are designed to burn up in the atmosphere
space,not_removed,the modules separate when the spacecraft is angled at about ° in prespective to the horison and thus the modules have no risk of coliding
space,not_removed,explosive bolts push the two craft away from each other and different drag profiles one burning updisintegrating work to avoid a collision in ksp you can turn normal or anti normal when you separate which should diverge the trajectory of the capsule and service module

space,not_removed,the luxembourgbased satellite operator ses said tuesday that it intends to launch a geostationary satellite on a reusable rocket in the fourth quarter of this year thats pretty soon if this succeeds i think it will be pretty big for the space industry while the common thinking that were too late to explore earth and too soon to explore space is somewhat true theres still pretty exciting things were making and im happy that im able to see them to quote isaac newton if i have seen further it is by standing on the sholders of giants this is part of building those giants
space,not_removed,dont get me wrong this is a step in the right direction but the only way spacex could make its first stage reusable was to reduce its size and increase the size of its for now unrecoverable second stage if it left the the same relative size as say a atlas v it would have been going way to fast to survive reentry without major damage spacexs does far more heavy lifting than any other booster on the market due to the cost of the larger and the cost of inspection and reconditioning my guess is that spacex will be able to cut off the price of a launch with a used booster which isnt exactly chump change but isnt an order of magnitude change as earlier hopedpredictedenvisionedwhatever the longest journey begins with a single step
space,not_removed,makes sense they lose a third of their value the second they leave the launchpad just make sure you look under the hydrazine tanks and check the rocketfax to see if its been in any space battles
space,not_removed,if i live long enough to see elons dream a reality thats good enough for me
space,not_removed,theres the httpsenwikipediaorgwikialcubierredrive but its super theoretical
space,not_removed,for example we know that traditional a to b travel via fuels and rockets is not practical for significant distances false we have put spacecraft namely pioneer voyager and new horizons on slow interstellar trajectories using relatively small chemical boosters and gravity assists for faster trajectories all we need is double down advanced ion thrusters are a workable alternative for small probes while bigger craft may need antimatter nuclear salts or just a few thousand nukes all of which still qualify as fuels and rockets so today are there any alternatives that have started to gain traction ie bending spacetimewormholes or something similar to star treks warpdrive none the fact that nasas alcubierre drive team at eagleworks has been trying to gain publicity by claiming that emdrive warps space inside it raises a lot of red flags and the emdrive itself already has more red flags than a communist rally

space,not_removed,apparently astronauts like the ones who just got back from expedition who spend significant amount of time in space develop muscle atrophy even if they exercise could this be fixed by simply hitting the iss gym more often or are there some fundamental effects of microgravity on muscles that cant be overcome that simply
space,not_removed,in my very limited understanding of orbital mechanics and hours of frustration with ksp ive come to realize that docking in orbit is pretty difficult and requires precise timing and positioning in gene kranzs book he describes the potential for an abort procedure during the descent phase of the lunar landing and the possibility that the lunar module ascent stage would fire during the descent and return to the crew to lunar orbit to dock with the csm how was this process supposed to work i figure that the positions and distance between the two crafts would be unknown at the time and difficult for a rendezvous to occur
space,not_removed,why did the lunar lander module of the apollo missions burn its thrust at an angle vertically below its retrograde vector instead of directly against the direction its going to slow itself down it seems to me that diverging from your vector reduces efficiency
space,not_removed,ive been reading the nasa authorization bill going through congress right now and im curious about the it states the intention to hand over ownership of the iss to another entity this would allow nasa to simply be a customer of the iss instead of the landlord is this viable i know the parts need to be recertified in in order to keep sending astronauts what about the iss end of life in order to crash it into an ocean we need to install a rocket booster on the side this would be a huge cost are there any organizations in a position to take on these tasks if nasa wants out

space,not_removed,question regarding the segmented mirror of the james webb telescope is each individual segment flat or are they all curved individually such that when they come together they form an unbroken parabolic curve if they are flat wouldnt the image reflected on to the secondary mirror be significantly blurry
space,not_removed,whats the science and feasibility issue behind not using ion pulse engines on everything out there after it breaks orbit seems like basic knowledge here theyd be much more efficient to use on something like iss to keep on target with chemical thrusters still available in case of emergencies im interested in this very and understand that theyve had the technology for a while just not as developed as it could be yet
space,not_removed,whats that
space,not_removed,my understanding is that it does indeed have a very small effect due to the vast distance but that the effect is cumulative so every orbit it produces a tiny tug on the rest of the solar system which over billions of years adds up to a measurable tilt

space,not_removed,ftl is too speculative to guess on realistically its going to be a combination of factors around slower than light travel once people get good at living in space they will naturally have acquired the technology and capabilities to build good longduration habitats which makes generational ships pretty much a nobrainer after that i suspect some sort of nuclear rocket fusion seems like a good choice but might be too difficult to pull off fission rockets are also possible such as nswr and pulsed nuclear explosive which could be primarily fusion would also be feasible ways to get up near percentages of light speed bringing travel times to nearby stars down to centuries or less additionally as technology advances so does biology and the human body at some point fairly soon life extension starts to become vastly more possible as does replacing your body and perhaps even your brain with roboticelectronic components the us that ends up traveling between stars may end up looking very much different than we do
space,not_removed,yes they do the plane of the orbit must pass through the center of mass of the parent body edit or actually the barycenter but for something as small as a spacecraft thats essentially the same thing as the parent bodys center of mass
space,not_removed,its just physically not possible you could of course actively keep such orbit by making constant inclination changes to keep yourself abovebelow equator by shifting the ascendingdescending node forward but nothing more
space,not_removed,its not possible not without constant adjustments anyways itd be similar to having a planet orbit around the sun but without the sun being in the plane of its orbit
space,not_removed,if we consider just the closest proxima b assume for a second it exists lets crunch some numbers proxima b is earth radius and is light years away from earth so the angular size can be found using tangents we need similar units so well use the conversion ly x earth radii so what well do is divide the width of the planet by the distance to and take the x degrees or x arcseconds of a degree phew thats pretty tiny but thats what we expect now for step we know that the angular resolution of a telescope depends on its aperture in fact it scales as resolution arcsec lambdad where lambda is the wavelength of light we need and d is the diameter of the telescope well use visible light lambda and set a target resolution of x arcseconds now the diameter is in mm since were dealing in arcsecondsso lets see rearranging we get d lambdaarcseconds d x arcseconds so if we build a telescope we could observe the disk of an exoplanet but nothing much on it we could maybe use some crazy analytical techniques to tease something out but nothing of consequence now to see clouds lets pretend that a cloud is the same size on proxima b as it is on earth according to google hurricanes are miles wide if we use that and go through the same numbers we get a needed resolution of x arcseconds therefore d x arcseconds d so we would need a telescope across to see that hurricane keep in mind that we have just considered only the nearest star system you can imagine how it might scale as we get further away now you see why we use light and spectra instead of direct imaging obligatory please correct my math if i am wrong
space,not_removed,basically impossible the way we can detect exoplanets is through their interactions with their star and through absorptionemission spectrum they are way too small and way too far to be seen directly
space,not_removed,there were some tests httpsenwikipediaorgwikiikaros but in general you would need a very large sail area and still get a very tiny thrust for most missions its just way more practical to use conventional propulsion for the same reason we dont use ion thrusters everywhere even though they are much more efficient than chemical rockets
space,not_removed,its been tried but its very difficult to be practical because its in the development phase it has a difficult time being selected for use on missions so its underutilized as launch prices fall there might be more rd missions for solar sails
space,not_removed,they already spend at least per day in the gym the problem is that on earth you exercise your body at constantly every time you lift your arm or leg you are lifting some kg there are also muscles that are simply difficult to exercise the real solution would be a centrifuge
space,not_removed,im assuming that pushing back for rendezvous was simply not an intention in an abort scenario the ams engine could not even be throttled however once the lm is back in a stable orbit the csm would have plenty of time for orbital phasing
space,not_removed,you would know the location of the csm and the lm to be honest give it a try in ksp undock from something in mun orbit start a deorbit burn get to pitchover for landing then decide to do an abort the csm will sort of be there waiting for you when you pop back into orbit might be slightly ahead or behind but by aborting back out into a slightly higher or lower orbit you can quickly catch up or drop back to rerendezvous with the orbiter
space,not_removed,it would return to a parking orbit lower than the csm and once in that phasing orbit they would just wait until the positions were right and then do the rendezvous they were already in an orbit in the same plane as the csms orbit so there wasnt a launch window or anything to worry about
space,not_removed,the lunar landing profile were not designed for efficiency but for precision and flexibility there were no good flat surfaces to land on as there were bolder and craters all over the lunar surface the mapping programs were extensive but could not accurately map the surface at the scale needed for the landing so the lunar lander would go down to a height and speed which allowed the astronauts to pick a landing spot and then allow the astronauts to make corrections to the landing profile to hit the spot they pick this is much easier if you fire the thrusters at an angle downwards as it slows down the entire procedure to allow the astronauts to have more time to make adjustments for the same reason the lunar lander were filled with more then enough fuel to make the landing
space,not_removed,the lunar surface is really bad for landing the eagle just needed a precise landing spot in order to avoid being damaged
space,not_removed,deorbiting the iss would not require any additional propulsion targeted deorbit only requires one of the cargo drones such as a progress or atv
space,not_removed,what benefits does that architecture have over the one they presented
space,not_removed,what youve described is often called a cycler one advantage is that you can have a big habitat with life support shielding and amenities for the long journey between planets which you only need to lift up into orbit once the disadvantage is that you can only bring a very small amount of suppliespeople up and down to the surface of mars spacex intends to deliver massive amounts of cargo to mars which makes a cycler not a very practical design for their goals
space,not_removed,thats mostly what they are planning the vast majority of the mass of an interplanetary spaceship is the propellant which dwarfs the rest of the mass several times over the easiest way to get to mars is then to put a mostly empty vehicle in orbit then launch additional fueling missions you could be even more aggressive and use smaller launchers to assemble a craft in orbit which again is going to be mostly empty fuel tanks by volume and then also fuel it as well but there are tradeoffs in doing things that way too
space,not_removed,if you were out in the middle of the oort cloud it would just look like empty space to you even if you had a telescope there are likely millions of objects out there but they are spread out over an extremely large area possibly even a third of the way to the nearest star system at that distance the sun would just look like a very bright star in another solar system we have very little direct observations of objects currently in the cloud most of what we know comes from observations of comets that have been knocked into the inner solar system by passing stars given that its tough to say exactly what the size distribution for oirt objects are we know there are plenty of icy bodies km or so in diameter and its possible there are much larger objects out there but at the moment there is no observational data to prove it
space,not_removed,there is an incredibly good youtube series on the crash coarse channel do a youtube search on crash course astronomy the first or so videos in the playlist will be about the planets then it will cover more stuff about how stars and stuff works each video is minutes long if youre looking for much more indepth hour long videos about planets there are good astronomy lectures on youtube by bruce betts of the planetary society
space,not_removed,maybe not exactly what you had in mind but cosmos both the original and the remake are very much worth watching and go into some detail about the planets as well
space,not_removed,torque zero if it produced torque it would flip over it aint no car each of the main engines is rated for mn and the two srbs pack another mn apiece there is a dazzling variety of rocket fuels depending on the purpose hydrogen burnt with oxygen is efficient because of the low molecular weight physics only permit monoatomic hydrogen or hydrogen deuteride to be more efficient but its low density means huge tanks the shuttle proper also involved the ammonium perchlorate composite propellant in the srbs which is far from efficient but an srb is basically just a huge steel pipe with one end capped propellant cast into it and ignited from the business end orbital maneuvering engines used monomethylhydrazine that ignites on contact with nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer astronaut eva maneuvering systems mmu and safer both used compressed nitrogen as to general rocketry in addition to hydrogenoxygen the two common combinations are being a subtype of jet fuel and unsymmetrical dymethylhydrazine nitrogen tetroxide a highly toxic carcinogenous mutagenic mixture that doesnt require refrigeration and can be stored in a silo for decades ready to unleash nuclear armageddon elon musks its is going to use methaneoxygen not revolutionary with methane being an intermediate between hydrogen and hydrazine and hydrogen peroxide are monopropellants since they decompose into hot gas on contact with a catalyst useful in small maneuvering jets ion electric rockets on probes use xenon or argon oldschool tactical missiles like the scud or the burn udmh or triethylamine and xylidine with inhibited red fuming nitric acid with nitrogen tetroxide and a corrosion inhibitor hf more exotic fuels include uranium used to heat up hydrogen or ammonia in a nuclear thermal rocket groundtested never flown and combined with a hydrazine blend with pentaborane or beryllium hydrade et cetera
space,not_removed,how much torque does a spaceshuttle produces none for its escape velocity space shuttle does not come even close to earth escape velocity is there any other source of fuel for spaceshuttles the shuttle used different types of fuel hydrogenoxygen in main engines solid fuel in boosters udmhnto for oms also keep in mind that while hydrogen is very efficient as chemical fuel it does not come even close to what ion thrusters can do hydrolox rockets have specific impulse up to while ion thrusters can go up to almost if you set an engine to produce of thrust and put there of propellant this is how much time would it take for the engine to run out of fuel
space,not_removed,torque is commonly misunderstood httpsyoutubeixabcpqizok
space,not_removed,it means that the mantle between the frozen exterior and the dense core is composed of liquid water europa is hardly unique in this aspect
space,not_removed,in that scenario just have the thrusters at the centre of the ring that way you dont have to worry about the thrust changing anything
space,not_removed,the answer is yes here are two articles describing how
space,not_removed,is this in order to create artificial gravity
space,not_removed,no theres not really any way to tell those apart with rv measurements alone as for the transit method it should in principle be possible to distinguish a moon and a planet transiting a star but only with extremely high accuracy you might for example notice a difference in the transit depth between one transit and another which could indicate that the moon is to the left or right of the object instead of in front or behind it
space,not_removed,most astronomers think the universe is infinite you could just keep going forever and ever and never reach a barrier of any kind
space,not_removed,no the centre is solid and you couldnt however there also no defined surface this sounds wrong but because of the massive pressure inside a gas giant the gas is compressed into a solid this means that as you descended into a gas giant the atmosphere would gradually get denser until it became liquid then solid and with no defined line between phases
space,not_removed,youre going to have to explain of that physics mindfrakkery that is going on there they would not fall instantly in fact they will be partially dragged along depending on what falling towards the sun they may instead achieve instant hyperbolic trajectories and remain orbiting the sun somewhere around earths old orbit
space,not_removed,ion pulse thrusters are expensive and sophisticated there are however alternatives such as pulsed plasma thrusters which in turn cannot be refueled furthermore theres the issue of cathode wearout which means frequent eva ops for replacement plus ion thrusters dont scale up well so youd be dealing with hundreds of them finally i think the unwillingness to design plumbing into nasaesajsa modules was a considerable factor beyond orbital stationkeeping electric rocketry has the problem of extremely low thrust which when trying to depart earth would mean dozens of trips through the van allen belts hence you still have to deal with a higherthrust booster
space,not_removed,theyre the landing and abort engines on the spacex dragon capsule
space,not_removed,best i can see theres still a test setup in semipalatinsk in kazakhstan ive got a decent technical description plus the initial price tag million roubles in iirc
space,not_removed,mkay its up
space,not_removed,is that for the whole probe do you know the number just for the just the propulsion system not including the scientific instruments and such
space,not_removed,there are no planets in our solar system for which that is true even at pluto the sun is times brighter than a full moon on earth on average at times it as bright as times brighter than the sun wow did not know that i knew that the earths atmosphere blocked a lot of light laymans terms but i didnt realize how much light the sun would pour out to something even as far as pluto can you clarify though you said first that midday on pluto is the same as right after sunset on earth and then you said it is at times times brighter than the sun is this just based on where in the orbit pluto is really interesting stuff
space,not_removed,mayne would be true for sedna at its aphelion
space,not_removed,i just kinda mentally grouped that in with the hypersleep i tend to agree that conventional travel means with possible hyperleep sounds the most likely it doesnt require too many stretches of technology im not sure whether relativistic effects would be much help i guess it depends on how much energy you have available
space,not_removed,i didnt realize that the center of mass and barycenter could be different how is that possible
space,not_removed,however is just the baseline you could have multiple smaller telescopes spread out along that distance using interferometry a planet as bright as earth from lightyears away would have a magnitude of about which is easily visible using the hubble telescope with a diameter of only if you had telescopes in a km net linked with interferometry you could see hurricanes on that planet
space,not_removed,thank you for putting my dreams in realistic perspective i love scienceyou fiend
space,not_removed,how will the james webb space telescope compare to your math will we be able to see an exoplanet in proxima b by using interferometry or some other magic
space,not_removed,they are way too small and way too far to be seen directly httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofdirectlyimagedexoplanets
space,not_removed,i meant more like visible light laser sails
space,not_removed,to create artificial gravity
space,not_removed,yep its really not that difficult it was certainly a challenge at first in ksp but eventually the concept just clicks in your head and you could probably do the maneuver blindfolded
space,not_removed,targeted deorbit of iss requires a specially modified progress atv is out of production see
space,not_removed,i dont know i was just curious as to if it was ever considered i would love to read about advantages or disadvantages it may have
space,not_removed,thank you for the reply so the cycler option may be prefered in the future for small transportations such as human cargo etc
space,not_removed,the main reason i ask is because of how we could possibly proceed with interstellar travel if we were to try to travel to proxima rather than go from earth we should first settle our solar system slowly from mars and then encroach outward i would think leaving from an oort cloud object would shave off a lot of time and distance
space,not_removed,hardly unique what other planetsmoons have this feature
space,not_removed,thank you mounting engines at the hub has some complications since docking occurs there and torques applied to the hub cause precession of the rotating ring spacexs proposed its booster spaceship and tanker have what it takes to launch and support a m diameter wheel in the sky space station electric propulsion ion thrusters would be great for stationkeeping such as reboost and orbital adjustments for collision avoidance i just want to know if ion thrusters can operate in a pulsed mode they are typically used for continuous thrust in deep space craft or geosynchronous birds if they wont pulse nicely another option is mounting them in such a way that they can swivel degrees that takes a bit more structure
space,not_removed,thanks this is just something ive been curious about for a while but couldnt find on google
space,not_removed,doesnt this shatter the multi verse theory or would it be a multi verse in a parallel universe way
space,not_removed,wrt the comment about the van allen belts every concept ive seen for ion propelled interplanetary ships starts in a high earth orbit which would avoid the vabs
space,not_removed,thats for the whole probe i dont know the mass of the engine that might not even be public information
space,not_removed,the center of mass of the parent body and the barycenter are different because the barycenter is the combined center of mass of both objects whereas the center of mass of the parent body is just for the one body
space,not_removed,i didnt realize that the center of mass and barycenter could be different how is that possible as another comment mentions the barycenter is the combined center of mass of everything in the system for our sun as an example it usually rests somewhere inside the sun but not always there are a few rare times where the planetary alignment is just right causing the barycenter to exist just outside of the sun its one of those things sheldon from the big bang theory might bring up to be pedantic you know technically the earth doesnt orbit the sun it orbits the solar systems barycenter which doesnt always exist inside the sun now get out of my spot of the barycenter locations over the past years you can see its not always inside the sun
space,not_removed,great point when i did the math i assumed visible light which if my very limited understanding of interferometry is correct you could not work the same way you work radio due to the short wavelengths the point however stands many smaller mirrors spread out the same distance apart would act as a larger mirror with the same radius edit careful with listing mags yes hubble can see very faint sources but they are point sources with no discernible detail so hubble could use spectroscopy to find water vapor and methane say but never to image the atmosphere of an exoplanet
space,not_removed,there are practical challenges you either need to pipe the light to a single sensor like httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwmkeckobservatory does or invent a new kind of lightsensor but you could make a telescope with an effective diameter of billions of meters or even more total collection area would still limit how dim of an object you could detect
space,not_removed,james webb telescope really isnt geared towards that type of astronomy while it can see visible light its primary focus is in the nearinfrared range but it can also see orange and red visible light as well as the midinfrared region depending on the instrument for seeing exoplanets youd want something different something httpsenwikipediaorgwikigiantmagellantelescope or better yet httpsenwikipediaorgwikiadvancedtechnologylargeaperturespacetelescope
space,not_removed,good question using the same math and assuming it is looking for warm atmospheres i get a limiting resolution of arcseconds so how it will be able to directly image exoplanets im not quite sure likely through some inventive analysis techniques perhaps something like speckle interferometry
space,not_removed,yes however in order for the centrifuge to be safe to work in the diameter would have to be quite large otherwise you have large differences between head and feet but theoretically there could be a small diameter centrifuge only for sleeping
space,not_removed,depends on what you mean by building by now the idea of a separate transorbital craft is very much maligned too much of an initial overhead plus aerobraking then landing is much easier than thrusting the mother craft into a stable orbit and then deploying a small lander also such a craft would undoubtedly have us bogged down for decades in development of a more fitting propulsive system than chemical rockets
space,not_removed,it very well might be elon has mentioned that option as a possible future optimization for interplanetary travel though it would be expensive and impractical early on you could imagine it a bit like a big cruise ship that needs to park a few miles from shore with passengers coming and going by raft not great for moving lots of cargo but great for moving people
space,not_removed,as you go further from the sun planets and moons become less and less suitable for colonisation a colony is only viable if it has the potential to be truly independent and theres really only one place in our solar system with that capability mars theres no chance of a planet in the oort cloud being viable for colonisation itd just be too cold and dark plus very likely made largely of ices
space,not_removed,ganymede enceladus calisto titan in addition to surface oceans triton possibly ceres and pluto
space,not_removed,not of you dock on one side and have the engines at the other and if youre not worried about needing to steer with the engines you could safely put them on the spokes not at the centre
space,not_removed,total collection area would still limit how dim of an object you could detect can you overcome this by increasing the length of the exposure
space,not_removed,now im hyped for the giant magellan telescope thanks
space,not_removed,thank you for anwsering again i guess one day the takeoff and landing technologies for small craft will make it easier to move people as well as cargo from surface to a cycler
space,not_removed,wow didnt know that why are we specifically pursuing europa so much then does it have the most water or the most stable
space,not_removed,i will probably have both rim thrusters and hub thrusters best to have both belt and suspenders if you apply force to one side of a hub perpendicular to the axis of rotation you need to either apply equal force on both sides of the hub or you need to use control moment gyroscopes to null the torque i also want dual docking areas for redundancy one at each end of the hub
space,not_removed,yes but depending on how much more light you need it might not be practical if you are trying to image something that moves such as the surface of a planet you are fundamentally limited in exposure length
space,not_removed,europa experiences strong tidal forces which keep the water liquid and moving which brings minerals up to the surface this is evident in the plumes of water which spray km high and which were observed by hubble in and all this is important because it should be possible to taste the plumes with an orbiting probe and because of all the movement of the water its a good bet that whatever is under the ice will be in the plume will it be life
space,not_removed,closer smaller than ganymede iirc and considering how much were pursuing it ie at paperonly study level it might have to do with its subjective prominence in the minds of the people
space,not_removed,this is so cool i do hope this is a step toward affordable space travel
space,not_removed,if mars were to magically have a full earthlike atmosphere it would take millions of years for it to erode to an unbreathable level an eyeblink on cosmic timescales sure but an eternity as far as human civilization is concerned its just not a problem worth worrying about
space,not_removed,why arent we thinking about subsurface habitation if radiation is such an issue correct me please because im more than likely wrong wouldnt putting a huge layer of rock prevent extreme amount of surface radiation maybe figure a way to utilize all those rads for energy production im not really a scientist or any other form of ists im just curious
space,not_removed,its possible either way but having a magnetosphere helps the low mass also makes it more difficult for gas to hang out around mars but there doesnt seem to be a reason why we couldnt do it at some point in the far future also it seems pretty reasonable to expect that we could genetically engineer types of algae fungus and eventually plants that would be able to survive on mars once theres enough atmosphere to tone down the radiation and prevent everything from freezing
space,not_removed,the thing is only a type civilization or greater can truly terraform a planet best humanity will be able to do for the foreseeable future is colonize it
space,not_removed,yes but you would need to get huge quantities of an or some other inert gas and to the martian surface and no probably not in our lifetime
space,not_removed,well kind of the magnetosphere is a problem for radiation on the surface not necessarily for keeping the atmosphere the biggest issue however is that mars is tiny as in there isnt a whole lot of surface as it is and there would be less if we made oceans also imagine walking around on the moon thats what walking on mars would be like except slightly less exaggerated its not clear how big of an effect this would have on various forms of life human life notwithstanding its not impossible but to date i have yet to see a realistic discussion of terraforming mars that takes these things into consideration
space,not_removed,theoretically yes it most certainly will not happen in our lifetime though colonization maybe terraform nope but mars weak magnetosphere is only the initial and arguably the most difficult hurdle to jump over
space,not_removed,how long would the moon hold on to its atmosphere
space,not_removed,wouldnt the gravitational pull of mars be a lot less than what it would take to allow for an earth like atmosphere or is its mass sufficient enough to allow some sort of atmospheric convection without huge losses in atmospheric gasses dont really know if my question makes sense
space,not_removed,those are the first plans for mars habitation i believe small research habs for scientists can make do with a centralized safezone which is shielded though which is why the first visitors probably wont go underground if a permanent outpost is created it would undoubtedly be underground
space,not_removed,one benefit to that lower gravity is that for mars to have a surface pressure similar to earth the atmosphere will have to be much taller i think roughly taller this thickertaller atmosphere will naturally help block some of the extra radiation that hits the surface
space,not_removed,we could probably fuck it up so nobody can live there
space,not_removed,we might not even make it to a type
space,not_removed,total bs mars is easy literally all the raw materials we need are in the kuiper belt and asteroid belt there are an endless amount of massive balls of nitrogenamonia and water just orbitting out there we will build a robotic lander army that will have one module to convert the dirty snowballs into fuel and another model that uses that fuel to slow the ice balls down and thereby send them into the inner solar system in a controlled fashion if done correctly they could be crashed hard onto mars or simply left in mars orbit and sent down in chunks this will add energy helping to melt the mars ice and also add much needed nitrogen and water the goal will be an atmosphere taller than that of earth this will create earth like surface pressures that higher atmosphere will block radiation very well theres just that many more atoms between the surface and space to scatter gamma rays and block photons it can all be automated and each miningsteering robot could detach and be reused mars is easy it will take time but its easy
space,not_removed,best humanity will be able to do for the foreseeable future is colonize it by colonize do you mean settle
space,not_removed,luckily the entire kuiper belt is made of nho gases in various ices slow one down and inward it falls you can also create fuel from those gases to fuel the rockets needed to slow them down
space,not_removed,not for the reasons you think the magnetic field while it does protect some of the atmosphere from eroding quicker than usual is not a requirement to have an atmosphere mars largest issue with having an atmosphere is its size and the fact it went cold long ago no volcanism and no liquid water means no cycle which means bye bye atmosphere
space,not_removed,the problem is that the moon just doesent have the gravity to hold on an atmosphere for very long so it would happen much much much faster than on mars
space,not_removed,i dont know exactly how long the moon would hold an atmosphere for the moon could hold it for probably years or something along that line but it would dissipate much faster than mars it would take significantly less material roughly to percent the amount of material used to terraform mars this would make it much easier cheaper to do and much easier to maintain however if you give the moon an atmosphere and oceans we have no idea how exactly the materials on the suface would react and exactly what chemical reactions would be formed the moon has large quantities of iron and when mixed with water form iron absorbing mad amounts of oxygen in the process depleting the atmosphere of oxygen i love the idea of terraforming the moon but honestly its not as easy as just add air and water
space,not_removed,it doesnt but ill try to answer anyway mars has lower gravity which means the atmosphere needs to be taller for the same amount of pressure as would be exerted on earth titan for example has an atmosphere many times as tall as earths and it is about twice as dense higher pressure at the surface despite titan only having about half as much gravity as mars mars would lose its atmosphere quickly compared to a heavy planet like earth but quickly for a planet is veeeery sloooow for humans
space,not_removed,well we are doing a fecking sterling job on earth so probably true
space,not_removed,there are an endless amount of massive balls of nitrogenamonia and water just orbitting out there no not really the mass of the asteroid belt only adds up to about the mass of the moon with about half of that mass being ceres vesta pallas and hygiea its not like the movies with massive asteroids floating around everywhere theyre actually quite small and far apart on top of that out of the small percentage of asteroids that are small enough to actually capture not even all of them are ice balls many of them are rock or other various elements that would be of no use to crash into mars
space,not_removed,well thats just like your opinion man
space,not_removed,i mean build small research outposts that will require constant resupply for upwards of a decade before they eventually become anything approaching self sustainable
space,not_removed,theres a reason it went cold
space,not_removed,i just mentioned the same thing below about the height of the atmosphere i think its a factor thats being far too over looked that extra of atmosphere to block radiation and scatter gamma rays high up will be the equivalent of a additional meter of aluminum shielding now mars isnt flat either the density of the atmosphere in the deep valleys and craters will be much higher as we add nitrogen and water iceball from the kuiper belt the atmosphere will become very hospitable mars is easy
space,not_removed,kuiper bely not asteroid belt ort cloud its endless for all intents
space,not_removed,yes its sizecomposition no magnetic field is a result of being cold not the cause
space,not_removed,i would agree that mars is easy in the context of all the other planets in our solar system but its still pretty difficult not impossible though
space,not_removed,any insight to what the weather might be like would the climate be suitable for plant growth without the need of a greenhouse environment and would the atmosphere be sufficient enough to absorb enough harmful radiation to allow for anything to live
space,not_removed,well of course we could go way out there and get asteroids but at that point you might as well just go to another already habitable planet it would make no feasible sense to bring asteroids from the kuiper belt or oort cloud all the way in to mars it may be possible from just the asteroid belt but it definitely wouldnt be as easy as you make it seem
space,not_removed,plants can live in far lower pressures but not mars low of earths pressure might be enough and that will be found in the deep craters and valleys first genetic engineering and just plain old natural selection will be the ultimate solution
space,not_removed,what the nearest habitable planet is centuries away if not millions of years away and once you got there youd basically have to do everything we have to do to mars we dont even have to send people to the oortkuiper belt we can simple create robotic probes that do all the work over the course of years you plan has all the issues that mars has but with none of the benefits like actual feasibility and proximity to earth
space,not_removed,luckily those nerds dont write newspaper headlines if they did people would start being informed which as we all know would be super bad s
space,not_removed,im not convinced that even if it was glaringly obvious it was aliens that nasa or anyone official would actually admit it
space,not_removed,this article doesnt bring anything new im not even sure why it was written despite the super exciting headlines most normal people know that we dont know anything for sure at this point however am i the only one who believes that a media frenzy episode is good once in a while otherwise how do people still stay excited how do the funds keep getting directed to seti we need this idea the possibility of a proof that we are the only ones in the universe to stay in our minds
space,not_removed,someone tell spacecom because my facebook is blowing up from their posts
space,not_removed,i mean im pretty sure a scientists whole entire goal is to inform people
space,not_removed,these scientists are part of seti which is an organisation thats trying to search for signals sent by aliens plus im pretty sure nasa would want the funding boost that would quite likely come with discovering alien life
space,not_removed,because wired loves to write snarky articles
space,not_removed,either that or simple curiosity i imagine i admit that when i saw the headline this morning i clicked and read it i mean could you imagine not reading the breaking news story about actual evidence of alien life id feel like a bit of a twerp its much like headlines announcing the latest super food or whatever else interesting findings lead to ridiculous headlines its best to not get too disappointed when it turns out that news editors are vying for ratings rather than reality
space,not_removed,for me as a scientist it is all about knowing how things work and how things are certainly there are the rock star scientists who care about informing people and get on the tv but in this case i dont see any compelling evidence that this signal is anything but from a natural source
space,not_removed,idk i think the backlash from such an announcement would be ridiculous nasa is a government org it isnt private and therefore beholden to the whims of the powers that be i just dont see an announcement ever being made whether or not its actually discovered
space,not_removed,why not what would be the benefit of that america would love to be the nation that discovered the greatest question are we alone nasa would get a huge increase in funding the american public would become enticed i dont buy the the whole world will panic and civilization will end either
space,not_removed,im sorry but i really dont see why there would be any backlash considering that nasa has been very public about trying to search for life and that they think theres a very real possibility of alien life i dont think a discovery like that would be held back
space,not_removed,i think wed all be excited reddit seems to think wed freak out and want to destroy them idk why
space,not_removed,discovered the greatest question thats thats not how it works
space,not_removed,no it would probably set off a new space age it might unify the world in a way like never before no longer is it different subgroups of human populations as the other our differences would seem insignificant when compared against an civilized alien planet thats my hope anyway
space,not_removed,yeah i think humans would be really excited now the aliens i have no idea how theyre react i always thought that theyd be more peaceful that is until i read the three body problem and the sequal the dark forrest now im a bit terrified that something out there is going to detect our radio signals
space,not_removed,source i think
space,not_removed,mountain sized asteroid even the simplest things in space seem daunting if they ever headed our way
space,not_removed,awesome animation gives a sense of scale for small bennu the nasa animations are really getting good mixing computer animation with simulation calculation data this is more record breaking than another probe to another planet this is getting a substantial amount of surface material from a dark body carbonaceous asteroid and bringing it back to earth only days away from history in the making btw that animation is showing years from liftoff to return
space,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikitreeoflifebiologyhorizontalgenetransfer water bears are definitely not the spark but they are very close check out this wikipedia article as for the second half of your question mars environment is quite restrictive and the sort of life that came to be on earth cannot occur given current martian conditions they may instead evolve down a different path but the process needed to see that happen will take too much time thus we can only speculate
space,not_removed,from what i understand this is actually something nasa have been concerned with in the past and why sterilisation an issue galileo was crashed into jupiter primarily to prevent bacteria from contaminating europa and io after recommendations by the nrc i think it would be really interesting to see a planet colonised in this manner but once you commit to that sort of experiment there is no undoing it much like introducing certain species into other countries httpwwwtearagovtnzenintroducedanimalpests there is a significant risk of damaging the environment so i think its unlikely they would be willing to attempt this at the moment
space,not_removed,edit dump
space,not_removed,tardigrades are complex multi cellular organisms and are most certainly not the first life to emerge there is evidence of fossilized bacteria dating a few billion years before tardigrades would have emerged in the cambrian era
space,not_removed,what if they came here on a comet
space,not_removed,panstarrs is the biggest digital mapping effort yet done but it is not the last the large synoptic survey telescope now being built in chile by the national science foundation will eventually supersede it surveying billion galaxies and stars and producing terabytes of data every night for years once it is completed in no mention of gaia galaxies are not its main focus but it will observe every region of the sky dozens of times over its lifetime of a few years
space,not_removed,the water tower looks like a dumbed down rocket in a straight jacket
space,not_removed,also a photonics engineer the ring laser gyros and lidar were the first two to pop into my head for currently used technology for some other ideas ive looked at people developing deep space optical communication networks as well as a wide variety of sensor development a lot of sensors for probes are one off builds and many of them utilize photonic sensing take a look at whos making probes for future missions and get involved with research groups associated with them
space,not_removed,i cant believe i didnt even think of lidar work thanks for the response
space,not_removed,i will thank you
space,not_removed,no its more like youre getting downvoted for acting like an obnoxious child dont worry kid youll grow out of it i had my awkward wearallblacknobodyunderstandsme teenager phase as well
space,not_removed,this is the worlds shittiest alien cover
space,not_removed,youre laying it on a bit too thick especially when you go for the militant atheist routine but i always appreciate a good troll keep up the good work
space,not_removed,stop it this instant you two
space,not_removed,youre laying it on a bit too thick too much reality to handle eh militant atheist routine lol you forgot the whole youre so angry bit i always appreciate a good troll not even a faint attempt at trolling sheep just dont deal well with the truth
space,not_removed,but moooooommm he started it you know i tried reporting my own post here for being offtopic nonsense but apparently you can only report others a shame really i suppose a mod could see this and wipe the entire conversation but given that this is but one of several dozen times this same story got posted itll probably just die a slow and natural death like the eventual heat death of the universe see made it ontopic again
space,not_removed,or is this to do with photoevapouration
space,not_removed,rshittyaskscience it would take millions if not billions of years
space,not_removed,the fastest ferrari goes about kmhr the milky way is km across it would take days to cross it
space,not_removed,your friend has no idea how fast ferraris can be but you have no idea how big the galaxy is
space,not_removed,is this a serious question it would take multiple lifetimes to achieve that no matter how fast of a car you have
space,not_removed,well according to a google search the fastest ferrari can go a maximum of miles per hour the diameter of the milky way as said by google is about light years across across so the amount of miles in light years is approximately that divided by gives you hours or days
space,not_removed,if you could get your ferrari up to light speed it could cross the milky way in just years
space,not_removed,i know its literally hundreds of miles from one end to the other but weeks just seems ridiculous to me he has no idea how fast ferraris can be hundreds of miles is definitely an understatement san francisco is hundreds of miles from los angeles we are hundreds of thousands of miles from the moon almost million miles from the sun the milky way is hundreds of quadrillions of miles across
space,not_removed,if by multiple lifetimes you mean the current age of the universe times or so then yes
space,not_removed,you of course couldnt but if then something like instantaneously apparently
space,not_removed,that depends on which reference frame i think from the cars pov or an external observer the laws of space and time be a harsh mistress
space,not_removed,indeed as stated get your ferrari up to light speed were fairly safe to assume the cars pov but would we find anything there at the end of history
space,not_removed,maybe someone has already accelerated a ferrari to light speed and it is already on its way there is no way for us to know either way
space,not_removed,thanks for this perhaps someone can tell me what the passengers are using for power during the fueling period are the solar cells deployed and then stowed for the burn i guess i would launch a fueled first then the passengers then some more fuelers really this screams for a space station that has all the fuel or has scheduled fuel flights then the passengers launch and transfer to the fueled trans lunar module and away they go ditto on the mars end
space,not_removed,has anyone calculated the length of ramp necessary to reach the ground at a reasonable angle from the cargo door
space,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters last usageinterplanetary transport system see mct mctmars colonial transporter see its jargondefinition last usagesmall rocket motor that fires to push propellant to the bottom of the tank when in zerog im a bot and i first saw this thread at oct utc ive seen acronyms in this thread has acronyms httpdecronymxyz httpsredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
space,not_removed,looks great the only thing that irks me is the base of the lander not aligning with the bases of the statue of liberty and christ the redeemer it makes the lander seem larger than it actually is
space,not_removed,i like how at the end there are options to land to fly straight at the planet and land or to do a lap and bleed of some speed which puts less stress on the craft but its going to take a few hours longer like forget the estimate of months travel time and lets worry about a few extra hours at the very end and just come in hot cant wait i got planets to colonize here
space,not_removed,how do the ullage engines work why arent they subject to the same fuel drifting problem as the rest of the engines solid fuel if so wont they be able to fire only once
space,not_removed,question why or how are there multiple refuelings wouldnt once just fill it up or is it being super compressed then why cant it be super compressed in the tanker and just be done once
space,not_removed,huh i had no idea that the statue of liberty was taller than christ the redeemer i suppose being on top of a mountain makes it look larger than it is cool graphics though
space,not_removed,i would be fucking terrified to ride in that thing its awesome and all but thats gotta be nuts
space,not_removed,might i suggest a redesign fuel above and cargo and passengers at bottom so it isnt top heavy when it lands in a low gravity environment that way passengers and cargo enjoys a short rampstairs down to the surface of mars and not have to climb a bloody ladder as high as the statue of liberty
space,not_removed,why land the whole vehicle wouldnt a dedicated lander which decouples from the transfer vehicle in mars orbit be better
space,not_removed,so wethey are basically launching the statue of liberty to mars that really puts things into perceptive
space,not_removed,now you just need to figure out the parts that spacex hasnt either like micrometeorite impacts radiation exposure and surviving for extended periods with lowmicrogravity
space,not_removed,you need to have at least stages stage the lander to actually descent to mars and ascent back to the orbiter the orbiter will have all the solar panels for power generation and possibly the fuel for the return trip
space,not_removed,it seems like the obvious way to do it is have a fullyfilled tanker waiting in orbit for the spacecraft so they just launch refill and go
space,not_removed,imagine a space station that instead of getting fuel from earth gets robots to fuel the space station which have been sent by fuel mining expeditions to asteroids and nearby planets like mars
space,not_removed,with solar panels i assume theres going to be huge batteries aboard too maybe the size of the batteries used by tesla for homes or just of them connected the solar panels i assume as well theyre for power whilst at mars since the solar irradiance term is only around compared to it doesnt need to be fully extended to charge depends on their system of deployment looks kinda like origami stuff tho efficient use of space
space,not_removed,meters they are going to use a freight elevator
space,not_removed,elon has said there will be a cable elevator
space,not_removed,why would you have a ramp they would probably just use a tower
space,not_removed,yeah but the lander is going to mars and mars is really super high up in the sky so it makes sense to put the lander higher up than the two statues sssssssss
space,not_removed,it also requires a very precise aerocapture pass something which hasnt been demonstrated yet
space,not_removed,they probably use gaseous methane and oxygen which fills whatever tank its in
space,not_removed,because the amount of fuel that will fit in the lander weighs far more than the tanker can bring up in a single launch
space,not_removed,the tanker isnt full by the time it gets up there it needs to use a lot of its fuel to get into orbit
space,not_removed,in low gravity it wouldnt matter much whether it is top heavy or not and during reentry to earth it likely has no cargo left anyway just some stones brought back plus it is probably pretty convenient to have the fuel closer to the engines
space,not_removed,how do you refill the propellant tanks at mars
space,not_removed,because that only adds complexity when the whole vehicle is being reused anyway
space,not_removed,better how theyre cutting costs by designing just one crewed spacecraft type can provide more usable living area this way and theres significant fuel savings to being able to do a direct entrydescentlanding for your proposal theyd need to budget the tons of extra fuel needed to do a standard powered orbital insertion before landing
space,not_removed,or maybe theyre working with nasa to solve it please see attached link
space,not_removed,are you worried about radiation en route
space,not_removed,all of these issues have been dealt with successfully for decades with the exception of solar radiation which is much easier to shield against than cosmic radiation they are still hard problems and it will take hard work to make the its
space,not_removed,micrometeorite impacts bury yourself in martian regolith radiation exposure go faster go underground once you get there and surviving for extended periods with lowmicrogravity astronauts have survived microgravity for longer than the projected its transfer times and martian gravity shouldnt present any additional difficulties its
space,not_removed,micrometeorite impacts vehicle can take it radiation exposure just go faster and surviving for extended periods with lowmicrogravity just go faster and see what happens
space,not_removed,radiation exposure and surviving for extended periods with low microgravity these two are solved by fast transit times we cant block them so load more fuel and burn like hell to minimise exposure
space,not_removed,im just illustrating what spacex plans to do they have dozens if not hundreds of engineers far smarter than i all of them thinking of how to colonize mars
space,not_removed,you need to have at least stages stage the lander to actually descent to mars and ascent back to the orbiter not if you can refuel on the groundthe upper stage is supposed to have about of dv when fully fueled and with minimal payload thats plenty to get back to earth if youre standing on mars
space,not_removed,the complication here is that you need multiple refueling flights and it would be convenient to use the same tanker multiple times instead of having multiple tankers that can wait in orbit
space,not_removed,even the lightest missions will require a minimum of three tankers and if they only have one and are reusing it for the multiple missions theyll only be able to prefuel it once
space,not_removed,build a gas station in orbit with enough fuel to go to mars fuel it up with the tankers and then launch the crewed version refuel in orbit and then just go to mars then while in transit the tankers refuel the gas station
space,not_removed,as the spacecraft will be exposed to the sun for almost the entirety of its flight im not sure what use a significant battery bank would be youd need some capacity sure but i wouldnt think youd need much
space,not_removed,launch towers dont exist on mars
space,not_removed,deleted
space,not_removed,impacts en route not on mars youd need fusion rockets to go fast enough to avoid serious issues survived but not without serious problems and they didnt have to survive on mars after but went right into the arms of professional earthbound medical care sorry these are issues that cant be hoped or handwaved away they require new materials and other tech that doesnt exist yet
space,not_removed,vehicle cannot take it and go faster costs or requires new tech then again what did i expect from reddit smh
space,not_removed,you can use the same tanker multiple times just have a second tanker waiting on orbit
space,not_removed,if they only have one that seems extremely unlikely a single maintenance item on the one tanker grounding it and preventing people from going to mars no way the tanker is the cheapest element theyre going to have more than one
space,not_removed,why not just use one of the tankers
space,not_removed,power failure power used whilst on ground but just prior to launch all systems like ignition of motors eclipse times redundancy if theres a solar event you want to retract the panels during this period
space,not_removed,spacex is just at the very beginning of its its project so of course they havent figured out all the details your snarky comment suggesting that this is somehow a failure on their part deserves a snarky comic in return besides none of those things you mentioned are that big of an issue anyway
space,not_removed,it all depends on what kind of risk and exposure youre willing to accept musk himself conceded that the initial missions will be quite risky and thats fine theyll be crewed by people who know what theyre getting into and are ok with that
space,not_removed,youd need fusion rockets to go fast enough to avoid serious issues no rad data show an average gcr dose equivalent rate of millisieverts per day on the journey to mars when rad measured the radiation inside the spaceship a day transit means the expected dose en route would be msvday days sv nasas current limit on crews is sv in days which is times greater than the dose the crew en route can expect to receive days its not a problem
space,not_removed,vehicle cannot take it they wouldnt make it if it cant take it and go faster costs costs fuel but saves food water radiation exposure and bone loss its as if they know what they are doing or requires new tech right they are building it then again what did i expect from reddit smh i dont know smh
space,not_removed,its is specifically designed to go faster so no it doesnt cost
space,not_removed,i do not think that they will have the to tankers that would require when they start mars flights
space,not_removed,need several and if youre just gonna leave it in orbit no need for reentry gear kind of like how your house doesnt need wheels
space,not_removed,all the same i cant imagine ever needing battery capacity for more than about an hour or two the only potential time where this is extended is after landing on mars at that point you may be without power for a few hours longer if the spacecrafts solar panels cant be deployed ingravity however even then the batteries dont need to be a part of the ship itself and can instead be considered part of the payload mass
space,not_removed,deleted
space,not_removed,maybe im less willing to sacrifice other peoples lives and health for dubious returns than musk or you
space,not_removed,recently there was a reddit post on new research that the radiation would fry the astronauts brains
space,not_removed,and equally fictional at this point
space,not_removed,it would require tankers one to loiter and one to shuttle propellant up
space,not_removed,need several not if they can pump in and out of the primary propellant tanks fill the entire thing up with tons of propellant and thats plenty
space,not_removed,no the primary reason a mars colony doesnt exist right now is most definitely the distinct lack of a rocket big enough to do the job
space,not_removed,from another comment of yours where you said rockets are the issue youd need fusion rockets to go fast enough to avoid serious issues
space,not_removed,well good thing its not up to you then if people are willing to take the risks and its for a worthy purpose like settling mars im all for letting it happen
space,not_removed,people are willing to put their own lives at risk when it comes to pushing frontiers thats how we spread across earth in the first place thats how we got into space and landed on the moon you wouldnt be alive if everyone that came before you played it safe and stuck to what they were used to at some point someone has to have the balls to do the dangerous thing that advances the species i have an inkling that you are not one of these people
space,not_removed,in mice using radiation levels much higher than anything a mars crew is at all likely to encounter in short its probably not relevant
space,not_removed,source or link
space,not_removed,that study isnt really relevant and has been blown out of proportion by mainstream media same type of radiation yes same dosage hell no
space,not_removed,oh that makes sense one of the tankers can act a a fuel depot storing several times as much fuel as it is able to carry to orbit it did not occur to me that a tanker could hold that much but there is no reason for it to have less total tank volume than the ship
space,not_removed,loitering might be more expensive than getting those launches done also if your passengers die you just wasted money on putting fuel in orbit
space,not_removed,theyve said the tankers will need trips to refuel the mars ship
space,not_removed,that was a specific response to the claim go faster which is of course why you quoted it out of context weak stuff
space,not_removed,of course you are its not your life and you dont seem overly encumbered with empathy
space,not_removed,do you really want another generation of debters and various other people desperate to escape an old world being used as disposable explorers and settlers for the sake of the rest of us the irony of course is that the kind of person who sets this in motion and profits from it is not the kind of person who will ever have to pay that price
space,not_removed,if youre reusing all your hardware the cost of putting something into orbit is negligable
space,not_removed,so send one up and then send up another to fill the first all the way up including the tanks it used to get into orbit in the first place then send the crewed spacecraft up to refill from that one tanker
space,not_removed,go faster which is not necessary the spacex its can do the trip in an average of days
space,not_removed,yeah speaking for myself im definitely waiting until the price drops and the issues you mentioned are better understood and addressed but if other people are willing to take the risk why not let them
space,not_removed,my point is that the reusable tanker thats in the current design is designed for reentry heat and has engines and shit if you launched a big tank with no big engines or heating shields you could put either a bigger tank into orbit or put it there with a smaller rocket which would cost less though the way spacex and elon build their rockets rd for an orbital tanker might be more expensive than just building another reusable tanker
space,not_removed,im not interested in your cherrypicked shit
space,not_removed,because historically we let people who lack a good sense of risk andor desperate people make the sacrifices for us i would hope that we could do better in the exploration of space or at least that wed try
space,not_removed,lmfao youre convinced that radiation is a giant issue and uzlsa has just demonstrated to you otherwise
space,not_removed,good sense of risk their sense of risk is different than yours not necessarily worse people have different tolerances for risk and there isnt one good tolerance
space,not_removed,that sense of risk is often modulated by personalfamilial circumstances sense of duty and other elements which are easy for the wealthy and powerful to exploit
space,not_removed,and you think you an unrelated third party are better suited to determine whether they are acting appropriately in that situation
space,not_removed,nbsp im a bot please report any issue on httpsgithubcomopenseadragonredditbotissues
space,not_removed,from however this moon isnt exactly the same size as the other one and in fact should be called an asteroid that just so happens to be wandering around with us as we fly through space its not a moon its an asteroid and its been wellcovered your post breaks a few sidebar rules and has been removed please refer to the sidebar
space,not_removed,you havent been watching theres been like a dozen posts about it in the last few days
space,not_removed,is there some unified blue maps that shows that this is how you need to build your spaceship if you want to connect to the iss yes there is the idea for this universal docking collar mechanism began back in for the where an american apollo commandservice module docked with a soviet soyuz in earth orbit as a symbol of détente between the two nations leading up to this astp mission it was clear that a docking system that would allow for the two very different spacecraft from two different nations was needed to allow them to mate together what the soviets and americans came up with was something called the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiandrogynousperipheralattachsystem apas was used to allow the apollo csm and soviet soyuz to dock and newer versions of the system known as and were created to allow the american sts space shuttle to dock with the russian mir space station and later allow the sts shuttle to dock with sovietrussian segments of the iss nowadays american nasa and private firms like spacex or bigelow for example european canadian japanese and russian spacecraftmodules headed for the iss adhere to a docking system design that follows what is known as the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinternationaldockingsystemstandard the idea is to make all the docking systems in the future idss compatible so any spacecraft will be able to successfully harddock with the current iss or future space stations spacecraft or platforms in space it is a really good idea obviously to have this kind of standardized docking design both for nominal docking procedures as well as in the event of an emergency in space that may someday require one nation to go up and try to effect a rescue of another nations crew aboard a spacecraft or station this way each nation can design their own idsscompatible docking adapter for example httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinternationaldockingadapter and the european space agency is developing what they call an httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinternationalberthinganddockingmechanism so as long as these different docking adapter designs adhere to the idss standardized design protocols any spacecraft outfitted with one can successfully dock with any other idsscompatible adapter design
space,not_removed,no problem it really is a very good question you asked one thing i forgot to mention was about the nation of china who are also a spacefaring nation sending humans into space now aboard their capsules as well as having a space station of their own the chinese space station and chinese shenzhou spacecraft capsules are believed to use a chinesedesigned docking mechanism sometimes called the cds or chinese docking system that is based or cloned off the russian system the sovietsrussians first used on mir the chinese cds is said to be idssstandardized so while they have never been invited to the chinese shenzhou spacecraft should be capable of docking with the iss or other foreign spacecraft with idsscompatible docking collar systems and foreign nations would also be able to dock with the chinese space station if required

space,not_removed,it is really cool but space is a default sub so every new reddit is subscribed so i want to know how many people are here because they are interested in science
space,not_removed,neat
space,not_removed,expected but the sub has less activity than subs with subscribers dunno why
space,not_removed,if you laid each of them endtoend how far would it get you towards the moon
space,not_removed,people realizing they may still be around to see man on another planet is actually really cool

space,not_removed,dont they not count subscriptions till at least one sub is added removed
space,not_removed,it wasnt a default sub for me but i also have been on reddit for years or so i only just recently subscribed and have been absolutely loving this sub
space,not_removed,i am here because i love space i am interested in about anything humans are doing in it and sharing any information i a lowly carpenter can figure out about it all though with million subscribers and the weekly space question thread getting comments each week either there are a lot of people who know a lot about space on reddit or this sub is not frequented by the overwhelming majority of those million people
space,not_removed,simple less stuff to talk about interesting space stuff dont happen every day
space,not_removed,i recall the sub being at peak activity around when we hit subs and we did some big mod reforms most of these million subs only read and upvote posts on their front page so smaller threads indeed dont get that much extra activity
space,not_removed,trying to not sound elitist but from what ive noticed this is pretty much a layman sub most people are here just for the cool pictures without much regard for the science behind astronomy and space exploration
space,not_removed,this was posted by utrendingbot no ones bragging here and theres no call for shittiness
space,not_removed,you counted them all
space,not_removed,is this a kenm throwaway
space,not_removed,hopefully were the top thread
space,not_removed,i still hope for much more activity i pretty much know nothing about this field but i read everything that i get my hands on im simply fascinated and no i regret i havent chose another path when i was a kid but yet again ive learned in school that there are only planets
space,not_removed,how is the same point source of light split into different images with a single gravitational lens the caption didnt really go into that
space,not_removed,i was really hoping it would go fast as fast with him on it as it did in calibration
space,not_removed,seems like every time spacex does something i find myself wondering how elon musk feels is it routine to him by now is he cool with failure knowing that its just a delay not a showstopper or is he sitting silently in a chair staring unblinking at monitors his foot tapping uncontrollably i hope hes doing alright and that he has cookies just in case he needs em
space,not_removed,i believe one of the failed landings was on elons birthday i had thought of this same thing
space,not_removed,i dont pretend to know a lot about space so can someone please explain why on some earth photos from space you can see stars and some photos you cant
space,not_removed,httpwwwnasagovimagefeatureauroraandmanicouagancrater
space,not_removed,contrast exposure and brightness if there is a lot of light being reflected from the planet and the camera is adjusted to not be really bright the much less visible stars are not visible on night shots there is much less ambient light so they use higher exposure so more light is captured meaning the stars are not much darker than the rest tldr camera settings
space,not_removed,and in that one second betty white the queen and your favourite childrens tv host will be snatched from you
space,not_removed,so how are we counting down then happy new year
space,not_removed,somehow we all knew that was going to hold on longer than it should
space,not_removed,honestly has been a worse year for space nerds than almost anything else unless you really care about dead celebrities in no particular order you had spacex static fire anomaly tmt getting cancelled thanks to the native hawaiians the esarussian lander crashing into mars httpsenwikipediaorgwikihitomisatellitelossofspacecraft breaking up into different pieces the space station resupply on progress that ended up separating early the juno orbiter going into safe mode and preventing it from getting close pictures of jupiter and im sure many more sucked for space and im pretty much sure that will be better
space,not_removed,i dont even wanna hear a mention of us losing betty white
space,not_removed,i dont possess them so its okay
space,not_removed,you would just start the countdown one second later
space,not_removed,yeah i dont get why they do it this way they either add the second to june or dec which makes some sense as being halfway and the end of the year but i think they could have also added them on either may or nov instead still months apart but not on days where people are counting down the actual seconds for what its worth its been added on dec dozens of times before the last time was in
space,not_removed,unless an asteroid hits us
space,not_removed,is there hope for juno recovery
space,not_removed,tmt getting cancelled thanks to the native hawaiians ive not heard about this and cant find any news that supports that i do know in december of the building permit was revoked due to a lack of due process put in place for the appellants i know that they are considering other places for the tmt but its not been cancelled simply on hold pending a review of the application process but really who knows if that thing will be built its a shame that superstition is still getting in the way of science
space,not_removed,no thats like saying when we have leap day just start counting the number of days in february on february rather drastic example but still
space,not_removed,that would suck for earth not for space p
space,not_removed,apophis
space,not_removed,yes it actually appears that its just lost time at this point it has started returning data to include pictures expect some spectacular stuff in the next month meanwhile if youd like to follow it more closely theres a great sub over at rjunomission
space,not_removed,it was native hawaiians who protested this the whole way including the lawsuit that ended up being appealed and the appeal is what brought the injunction theyre cause is stated to be about keeping their land holy even if there are a dozen telescopes there httpsenmwikipediaorgwikithirtymetertelescopeprotests link has more
space,not_removed,its not superstition its part of their culture and history i may not be religious but i would still be pissed if someone bulldozed the vatican
space,not_removed,yes yes you would if you add to anything it goes next and so on if we throw an extra second onto the final count down it becomes seconds you would balance the last second by just waiting more second to start the count down for the new year add an entire day however is a drastic example but second is a lot easier to deal with than seconds
space,not_removed,ah awesome looking forward for to see jupiter up close
space,not_removed,there is a big difference between building a telescope on the side of a massive sacred mountain and bulldozing the vatican edit also there are already a few large telescopes on the side of the mountain half a mile from the tmt site
space,not_removed,its just the sovereignty movement latching on to an international project for free publicity
space,not_removed,so much for someone trying to be funny
space,not_removed,it was only five years ago when the space coast region was buckled under the loss of almost highwage jobs with the retirement of the space shuttle program youre kidding it feels like a fucking eternity finally some light at the end of this tunnel though
space,not_removed,florida has a president now man i really didnt pay attention this election cycle
space,not_removed,finally some light at the end of this tunnel though you sure that lights not just an oncoming train the presidentelect has both criticized the space program saying the money should be spent fixing potholes instead as well as praised it when talking to people at campaign events there yet hasnt offered any concrete plans the closest to plans that have been announced involve slashing parts of nasas funding earth science related so some of the optimism im seeing seems a little early

space,not_removed,every time i think of an astronaut i think of someone older so its strange to see people that seem to be in their in the photo
space,not_removed,today the methane levels exceeded tolerances by an order of magnitude i gagged
space,not_removed,this is reddit why hasnt the brazzers logo been put on this yet
space,not_removed,the guy at the bottom seems to have a huge head and tiny body wtf
space,not_removed,has anyone tried doing an orgy in the iss has anyone tried sex in space for that matter
space,not_removed,think those astronauts got freaky while up in space if i was locked up in space and miles out of the closest zipcode on earth i would spacebangs would be a new category in every pornsites searchbar imagine the gravity gangbang that took place here years ago
space,not_removed,i have to be honest i googled her and am let down that female astronaut is really cute in that photo and not in any of her others almost like its by design one wonders if its a case of if im cute they wont take me seriously and now back to reading astronaut bios and feeling like a deadbeat just like every time i google one of them and see their accomplishments lmao
space,not_removed,leave it to nasa to send cis white males to space and not one transgender women
space,not_removed,o am glad my eight dollars an hour can contribute to space explorationmaybe they could effort earth resurrection the greatest minds seem to distance themselves
space,not_removed,the tan ones probably launched from cape canaveral only a couple of days before on the shuttle the paler ones had probably been on station for months at that point
space,not_removed,i find it incredibly difficult to spot the russians in iss crew shots in real life its relatively easy but i swear everyone in space looks at least half russian
space,not_removed,does she ever feel pressured you knowbecause of the implication
space,not_removed,no well you will soon
space,not_removed,pretty sure this is the same storyline for the smurfs
space,not_removed,is there any objective reason for so few women in space i dont see size or physical strength as being very interesting for an astronaut is there so few candidates is it entirely a cultural bias from space agencies
space,not_removed,offsite team building activities in zero gravity sounds awesome is your company hiring
space,not_removed,i too work for an it company that takes team photos on top of an antigravity device
space,not_removed,koichi wataka didnt change his underwear for a month as a test of the garment he reported no body odour developing during that period thats the most interesting part if you ask me
space,not_removed,they all look over to me
space,not_removed,you can fit more space in a head like that
space,not_removed,rumour says yes rumour also says its very hard because due to the lower blood pressure its not very hard
space,not_removed,you suck at trolling youre way too blatant and clichéd
space,not_removed,just look at all those fucking white males i mean come on its
space,not_removed,what are you trying to say
space,not_removed,mark polansky doug hurley chris cassidy julie payette tom marshburn dave wolf and tim kopra were all crew members of the mission delivered tim to the iss he was beginning his mission with expedition and brought home koichi who had just completed working on expeditions and the other people traveled to and from the iss on soyuz vehicles gennady padalka and mike barratt arrived at the iss in march while roman romanenko frank de winne and bob thirsk arrived at the end of may this picture was taken in midjuly
space,not_removed,by i am guessing they took off from baikanour in kazhakstan
space,not_removed,does she ever feel pressured would you rather be depressurized
space,not_removed,all astronauts are trained in the dennis system
space,not_removed,where was this an hour ago at the bar he said alone
space,not_removed,ill give you a hint married couples have been members of the same crew still wondering
space,not_removed,i went to a presentation and qa with jay apt in seattle and someone asked this he hinted at yes as hard as he could without specifically saying so same goes for consuming alcohol which was also asked
space,not_removed,its impossible to get a boner in space or even at their high altitude orbitfree fall
space,not_removed,probably has something to do with the smaller number of women who are willing or interested in doing what one has to do for the privilege of going into space
space,not_removed,im gonna say few candidates not really sure thats a good question though
space,not_removed,also very rarely does a black person submit an application space is def a white persons game
space,not_removed,steve from hiring is probably causing this why are you so sexist steve why are you so racist its
space,not_removed,the space shuttles last flight was in currently we only have up to people on the station at any given time because the soyuz spacecraft can hold a piece and can be docked at the station at a time the shuttle carried up to crew but didnt stay in space as long as our soyuz crews do if there were soyuz launched crews and a shuttle crew that would give us the magic crewmembers on station at once and the shuttle never took off from anywhere but cape canaveral
space,not_removed,nope must be a shuttle the iss can only support people long term the shuttle carries given that a soyuz launches the max you get with a short term visit is
space,not_removed,arent most cosmoastronauts former military
space,not_removed,yeah those nerdinauts cant even figure out how to work a drill thats why they had to send up bruce willis and the gang instead obvious analogy
space,not_removed,i thought that most astronauts were macho fighter pilots before
space,not_removed,thats only happened once and on that mission they had basically no space or time to do it hour work cycle and the shuttle was tiny inside
space,not_removed,so no
space,not_removed,yes but mostly about clean up techniques
space,not_removed,oh man that sex mustve been out of this world
space,not_removed,the russians definitely drink i have to imagine the americans would take part
space,not_removed,not sure why they would have to hint its well known that they intentionally used couples to try it science of course apparently its absolutely terrible as youre unable to perform the right movements relative to each other to stay together without strapping the fuck out of yourselves and ruining the entire point of it
space,not_removed,its strange to think that alcohol in space is something youd have to hint at to say its occurred id think the russians would be experts at figuring out how to brew vodka on the iss by now as for sex thats a new one everything ive read said that it may not of occurred by now
space,not_removed,never heard of this whats the scientific explanation for that
space,not_removed,yeah but you can still work your prostate
space,not_removed,that has been said a lot but was never really proven it was just one hypothesis among many that tried to explain why men on average earned more than women in a society where everyone has equal opportunities as far as i am aware the current winning hypothesis comes from hormonal differences instead of those based in intelligence men are more likely to take significant risks leading to the majority of homeless people being men as well as the majority of people in highranking corporate positions presumably this along with gender differences despite equal opportunity my high schools computer science class had one girl account for the gap in the extremely demanding field of space exploration
space,not_removed,ive often thought this but i havent read any evidence pro or against do you have any source i can read on this
space,not_removed,one shuttle mission in carried a crew of
space,not_removed,there were crew last you can see scott kelly they also had during the in november
space,not_removed,i have read somewhere that it used to be the case but not anymore instead introverted personas are prefered as it was found that when living together in a confined space for some extended periods of time they got along better i cant backup this claim but i would be interested in finding out more about it
space,not_removed,honey get the poo vacuum we are going to get romantic tonight
space,not_removed,i imagine that money shots are avoided
space,not_removed,russians certainly drinked and smoked in their mir station
space,not_removed,do you have a source on that from what ive heard it is completely out of the question
space,not_removed,i believe it pertains to blood pressure though it has been a while since i heard it explained
space,not_removed,that has been said a lot but was never really proven what part the existence of the variance difference or that it is a driver of occupational attainment differences the difference in malefemale standard deviation in intelligence is not so far as i have ever seen seriously questioned any more
space,not_removed,almost certainly didnt smoke smoke would set off loads of alarms on a space station drinking on the other hand
space,not_removed,i wonder the same thing last i read maybe ago it was out of the question and was extremely unlikely to have occurred yet
space,not_removed,why would that be if it had a severe enough effect on bp to not get an erection it would definitely play havoc on just staying conscious and alive
space,not_removed,the existence of the difference to begin with there is clearly a difference in some manner thats how biology works after all but im finding conflicting papers all over the place a few of them directly calling the there is a wider range for men claim into question
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,im not a doctor but it appears this mainly occurs when astronauts spend a long time in space apparently due to how our cardiovascular system works on earth it doesnt send blood everywhere in equal proportions to counteract gravity hence why our hearts are so high up in our chest cavities its easier on earth for blood to reach the legs so the position of the heart allows more blood to get to our brains in space more blood ends up in our upper bodies than our lower bodies due to this im not a doctor or anything so i have no clue how this deals with erections maybe viagra will help as it was originally meant to improve bloodflow i bet that the doctors who deal with the astronauts either encourage such use or at least authorize such use apparently exercises the astronauts do are not only to prevent the muscles from withering in space but to help keep the cardiovascular system flowing efficiently httpwwwnasagovmissionpagesstationresearchccissfeaturehtml httpwwwnasagovvisionearthlivingthingsarterialremodelhtml httpswwwquoracomhowdoesbloodcirculationtakeplaceinahumanbodyinspace
space,not_removed,its not total blood pressure its a matter of where blood flows without gravity without gravity blood wants to flow to your most vital area areas as they have the most extensive cardiovascular systems on earth blood flow is subconsciously controlled by capillary motion along with other factors but still always tends to go down this is why erections are harder to get more than to keep when upside down in positions you are not used to additionally and this is a biggy your body reduces blood to extremities when face with unfamiliar pressure tldr you know when you stand up fast and get light headed because blood drains from your head like that but your dick
space,not_removed,only one of those the less reliable one not the nasa history page mentions smoking and it describes it as reportedly a qualifier it doesnt feel the need to add to drinking or lewd pictures in the toilet while its possible that a little smoking took place it cant have been a common occurrence for starters smoke is a huge problem and pressing emergency on a space station due to the closed atmosphere so space stations always have loads of smoke detectors the first article you posted discusses the noncigaretterelated fire emergency on board mir including the triggering of the master alarm by the smoke they also quote a cosmonaut as saying when i saw the ship was full of smoke my natural reaction was to want to open a window and then i was truly afraid for the first time you cant escape the smoke you cant just open a window to ventilate the room does that sound like the words of someone who is used to dealing with smoke in the space station if smoking did happen it must have been rare and done very carefully like blowing the smoke directly into an air filter intake due to the risk and the difficulty of smoking in space i doubt it happened but i could be wrong i guess
space,not_removed,fair enough i skipped the page while on my phone i try to find a better source since i heard this story multiple times so now im curious too
space,not_removed,for sure im interested too i had never heard anything for or against the idea it just doesnt make sense to me but i would be very interested to hear any reports that it happened
space,not_removed,ye know that i think of it wouldnt be that smart even for the russians heh
space,not_removed,the beautiful thing about this is the more you understand the mechanics behind whats going on the more impossible this seems to be this is truly a incredible moment in history
space,not_removed,was watching for minutes and then the money shot loses video feed why so happy it landed though good job spacex team
space,not_removed,rhappycrowds and for good reason well done spacex
space,not_removed,i have tears in my eyes we did it reddit
space,not_removed,what a historic moment we might have not seen it live but shouldnt the camera have still been able to record it if not what a shame
space,not_removed,we did it reddit man this is awesome that this has been successful
space,not_removed,is there a video of it landing if not im calling a fake
space,not_removed,that was my worry unfortunately thats the problem with the drone ship im sure theyll work something out in the future that prevents us from losing video feed though if you watch the video at the end there is a few seconds where you see the rocket on the drone ship
space,not_removed,what the hell are you talking about
space,not_removed,we spacex did it
space,not_removed,the camera would have recorded it yes
space,not_removed,apparently they dont have lineofsight to their droneship from the coast so they have to rely on satellites to get the footage but the landing burn prevents the drone from transmitting the stream to the satellite so its just a livestream problem they will certainly release the video when the get the drone back
space,not_removed,how do we know the landing really happened s
space,not_removed,they dont have lineofsight to their droneship from the coast the ship was actually quite far away from the coast this time as the first stage didnt make a burnback manouver it didnt return back towards the cape but it simply continued in a semibrakedparabolic fall further down range
space,not_removed,is that video out yet
space,not_removed,the landing barge cameras only had a satellite uplink and the vibration from the landing caused vibration in the antenna providing that uplink interrupting the signal there is probably video stored on the barge so its likely well have to wait a day or two before the barge is recovered and the uninterrupted video gets posted im kind of sad they didnt have a chase ship in the vicinity of the barge to get some long distance footage using a telephoto lens or maybe they did and that footage is coming too well have to wait and see
space,not_removed,what no i want to see the video of the landing that just happened otherwise im not convinced that it really happened s
space,not_removed,eh its not like they could hide a blownup droneship coming back to the port and they have a history of showing previous failures as well and what would they gain from pretending they can do this and that must be reaaally hard to stage and with a reasoning like yours would a full video be more convincing they could have still cgied the whole thing
space,not_removed,maybe you should just leave rspace we have no need for people like you
space,not_removed,i think you hit the nail on the head on the droneship was a blowup dummy of the rocket so they cut to black inflate it real quick and then tada
space,not_removed,if they can fake the moon landing they can fake this s
space,not_removed,hes being sarcastic there is s right there on his replies
space,not_removed,yeah true i guess
space,not_removed,exactly itd be super easy to fake the live stream but we got a glitch instead which kinda means they didnt fake it
space,not_removed,edited in after the fact
space,not_removed,if any of us could answer that question wed be too busy writing our nobel prize acceptance speech to dick around on reddit
space,not_removed,we do not know it does not interact with the electromagnetic spectrum
space,not_removed,what about concentrated dark matter does anyone know how to make it by chance
space,not_removed,one thing i thought of while talking about it with my dad is perhaps its just stars with dyson spheres around them blocking all the light that would normally be given off or perhaps its black holes but these are obliviously just crazy theories of ours
space,not_removed,we can see matter and we can see the gravitational effects of matter we see more gravitational effects that we expect it could be as simple as dark colored rocks that dont catch the light as complicated as some exotic form of matter or our calculations could be wrong and the gravity we see could be explained by the matter we see
space,not_removed,i know of three hypothesis weakly interacting massive particles basically particles that have a lot mass but dont interact with normal matter massive compact halo objects maybe there are a lot of hard to see bodies in the galaxy black holes brown dwarfs and rogue planets are difficult to see and they might contribute to the mass of the galaxy maybe our understanding of gravity at large distances is incomplete astronomers have been starting to map gravitational interactions in order to map where the mass is you can find the maps online there are also some scientists that believe dark matter forms long but thin strands around the solar system
space,not_removed,my understanding is limited but dark matter is something we havent been able to observe but believe exists because it helps explain certain interactions with gravity and the structure behind the observable universe basically its mass that we can mathematically prove but dont know how to interact with using our current technology we can only observe the affects with large scale situations things like the cosmic background and gravitational lensing
space,not_removed,our mathematical models on gravitation are incompatible with the observed universe according to these models galaxies spin too fast to be held together by the gravitational pull of the center so either the model is wrong or theres much more mass holding them currently were betting on the models the working assumption is that theres additional mass is in galaxies providing enough gravitational pull to keep them spinning the speed they do but completely invisible to our measurements its a theoretical concept more than anything
space,not_removed,nobody knows for sure what it is but it doesnt interact with light
space,not_removed,something that make our quantum physics possible mathematically but cannot be proven physically it is estimated to exist nearly everywhere there isnt actual matter
space,not_removed,it is called dark matter because we know almost nothing about it other than it seems to gravitationaly affect everything near it
space,not_removed,just a filler theory for why the universe is expanding extremely quick but research suggest that its too extremely weak to do such a thing
space,not_removed,parts plutonic quarks one part cesium
space,not_removed,youre thinking of dark energy

space,not_removed,there is no such thing as negative pressure absolute pressure asl is about psi it cannot equal or drop below zero no matter how hard you suck
space,not_removed,pressure is caused by fluidsgasses exerting force on a container when a container is at equal pressure the contents of the container exert force on the insides of the container equal to the force exerted by the surrounding environment on the container you can create a negative pressure on earth by removing gasses from a sealed container in this case the force exerted by air molecules in the atmosphere is higher than the force exerted by anything left inside the container at sea level air exerts pounds of force per square inch of surface area so the maximum negative pressure you can ever achive is psi space is pretty empty there isnt much there to exert any sort of force on a container so you can not have negative pressure of any significance
space,not_removed,vacuum is simply relative lack of any air gas molecules at standard temperature and pressure stp a mole of a gas occupies about cubic feet thats about times molecules the pressure is the effect of those fast moving molecules bouncing against the walls of the container they are also bumping into each other but we dont measure that directly so a vacuum is a reduction in the number of molecules which reduces the number of collisions with the wall and thus the pressure measured temperature is also intimately related but im ignoring that for now when nearly all the molecules have been removed we have a high vacuum as the vacuum gets higher the chance of molecules bumping into each other before they bump into the wall goes down this means each molecule may travel farther between collisions the mean free path gets longer at extremely high vacuums there may be a countable number of molecules flying around thousands per cubic foot the mean free path may approach the size of the container achieving this level of vacuum is extremely difficult on earth but that is still nowhere near the vacuum of outer space which can range from dozens of molecules per cubic foot down to one or two per cubic meter nobody i know of has achieved those levels the best way to suck up dust is likely to be electrostatic attraction this has been proposed for such things as mining moon dust it can also be used for processing such as chromatography to separate different materials
space,not_removed,afaik missions that talk about vacuuming a sample off an asteroid and such are planning to bring their own atmosphere in the form of a little nitrogen gas blower so shoot that at the surface and it will blow dust intoonto a collector no real sucking though
space,not_removed,thats what i thought until i read that article
space,not_removed,to give it to you as straight as possible no you cant have less than zero particles around
space,not_removed,manned space missions expected to launch from american soil in again
space,not_removed,i agree i just think that over a year period we should be a lot further ahead
space,not_removed,apparently weve been to the moon a number of times so why would anyone get excited about these repeated trips to low earth orbit
space,not_removed,the big excitement is to make crew launches routine again the shuttle was supposed to do that what was being hyped a shirtsleeve space flight back before the challenger the russians are staying with soyuz because of the reliability they were supposed to have a crew space plane for the first launches next year called kliper that was delayed several years after the decision it should be for the new humanqualified angara which now also looks to be delayed for a few more years the kliper has apparently been totally canceled and roscosmos is working on a new crew capsule instead the dragon cargo capsule is not far removed from a dragon so all these cargo flights are in preparation the shuttle got the iss up it was too expensive to use as a space taxi in a few years there will be work crews going up to the iss rather than a few astronauts making orbital space safe and routine is the difference with this next era
space,not_removed,the only other time the us didnt have the ability to launch their own astronauts to space was a lessthan year period between the final apollo mission and the first shuttle flight but during that time there wasnt a giant mostly usbuilt space station being neglected in orbit its already been years since the last shuttle flight by the time humans launch from american soil again it will likely have been over years since that last occurred its a big deal in more ways than just pride
space,not_removed,i get that but dont diminish what weve done in this time to go to the moon you pointed the rocket up and waited for a certain time and launched since then weve turned earth orbit from an empty voidless field to a global network of satellites that improve our lives in limitless ways such as hyper accurate weather forecasting the internet faster phone service national security etc sometimes further isnt always more impressive and i hold my case that we have made some massive strides in space voyaging in the past years have we lost that touch certainly personally i want america to lead the world in space flight technology even more than it does now i want americans to land on mars and americans to once again laugh at the idea that we have to stop somewhere they say the sky is the limit and we in america think thats cute we have to once again act on this attitude and revive the sense of ones duty to its nation to achieve this during the space race citizens flocked to nasa to push america into being in space by landing on the moon they did it we can do the same with mars and our children can take the torch and do something even more impressive than us thats just how i see it
space,not_removed,talk to congress and the general public nasa cant do anything grand without funding without significant public interestsupport the government wont see any need to increase nasas budget
space,not_removed,because the us currently doesnt have the capability to send people into space we should be excited to regain it
space,not_removed,if you dont have the ability to do something and then you gain the ability to do something thats pretty cool if id lost my ability to talk and regained it id think it was great i wouldnt be saying meh i walked before it doesnt matter also sometimes you do something and its huge and inspirational like the first transatlantic flight and thats cool and all but sometimes when you figure out how to do it again and again cheaply and safely it seems a bit boring like a transatlantic flight now but sometimes its more important because you can build on that the more boring getting to orbit or getting to the moon gets the better because we can build on that foundation no one wants and exiting foundation
space,not_removed,its chicken and egg money or interest what comes first
space,not_removed,its not about ability tho its only money that determines whether they go and im not sure its getting any cheaper
space,not_removed,thats kind of the problem neither seems to come first anymore the money does seem to always outlast public interest though i still cant believe people actually got bored after the first trips to the moon
space,not_removed,well it doesnt matter what you think money isnt a matter of opinion
space,not_removed,if you cant afford to do something you dont have the ability to do it and it is getting cheaper by a long way lets say if your willing to spend billion dollars with chance of failure to get guys into orbit well thats how firsts are made but if you want to build a structure on the moon with people or something you need things to be a lot cheaper a lot safer and to lift more thats incremental progress incremental progress isnt as sexy but its important
space,not_removed,im not sure its getting any cheaper right now it costs milllion per seat to get us astronauts to space aboard russian spacecraft and thats only american per flight boeing and spacex will get that price down to around million less there are many other benefits training mission planning etc to launching from your own soil rather than hitching a ride on another countrys vehicle the us wont have to risk losing manned access to space entirely if tensions build and russia decides it no longer wishes to fly americans having the ability to fly american astronauts to a space station that the us largely built is a big deal
space,not_removed,if you cant show its getting cheaper then its just your opinion which also doesnt matter
space,not_removed,i only mentioned money not ability in response to the analogy of losing the ability to talk that was presented otherwise youre right money can equal ability
space,not_removed,i agree i just feel that over a year period we should be a lot further ahead
space,not_removed,its getting much cheaper we paid less per seat for soyuz than we paid per seat for shuttle rides and the commercial crew contracts by boeing and spacex are cheaper per seat that soyuz whats your reason for thinking thats not the case
space,not_removed,just inflation and government waste and corruption
space,not_removed,its such a shame that its like light years away i mean it could be just a couple light years away and still be out of reach i really hope humans figure out a way to visit these places within a short amount of time
space,not_removed,assuming earth radius and earths mass lko low kepler orbit would be about kms vs about kms for leo escape velocity from planet surface would be about kms vs kms for earth escape velocity the inhabitants of this planet would have a harder time getting off their rock
space,not_removed,theres that word that i hate so muchmay i wanna know for sure
space,not_removed,we should be careful getting too close to your cousin can never end well
space,not_removed,agreed solar sails powered by high power lasers on earth would probably be as fast as we could get something to go unless we figure out some sort of warp drive
space,not_removed,it would really suck if we decided that was the way to go and we set out for it we get there many generations later only to find that it is worse off than earth from the previous species that grew up there and left in search of a new home
space,not_removed,but if it was a couple light years away not only would we be all over improving propulsion technology but there would be the chance that they came here first as minuscule as the chance that any life is intelligent and develops space faring tech is that life being close would really change things
space,not_removed,you never know we are getting closer to finding dark matter which could give way to new tech better than anything we have seen
space,not_removed,and they would be incredibly strong and formidable adversaries in the inevitable war
space,not_removed,youd still have to break though
space,not_removed,is a warp drive actually possible in the near future im generally curious
space,not_removed,i mean recentlydiscovered proxima centauri beta is only ly away from us lies in proximas habitable zone and is earth masses thats where project starshot has recently set its sights of course theres the slight issue of the planet most likely being tidally locked but there have been several important studies done which have said that being tidallylocked does not necessarily mean a world is uninhabitable
space,not_removed,how will dark matter improve the sort of tech were looking to improve on
space,not_removed,it is unlikely dark matter will impact propulsion technology
space,not_removed,some who weighs pounds on earths surface would weight pounds a planet earths radius but same density given constant density looks like a number of quantities scale directly with r
space,not_removed,yeah that would take some serious orbital maneuvers back to the warp theory
space,not_removed,no it violates known physics
space,not_removed,not in our lifetime i couldnt imagine unless some crazy stuff happens it does not violate the current laws of physics theoretically
space,not_removed,because he read a scifi book and hes a scientist now
space,not_removed,the maneuver would be quite simple it would just a take a lot of deltav
space,not_removed,it doesnt violate known physics it relies on unknown physics theres a difference
space,not_removed,doesnt a thoretical warp drive rely on negative mass to create a hump or spacetime behind the ship
space,not_removed,i see seeing how fast the technology has developed the last few decades one can only dream
space,not_removed,i was referring to reducing the velocity by using other planets in the system presumably to break
space,not_removed,its both of those at the same time just so you know read what you wrote
space,not_removed,negative mass violates known physics
space,not_removed,doesnt dark energy effectively act as negative mass
space,not_removed,probably but one thing that known physics tells us fairly definitively is that not all physics is known no that doesnt prove anything
space,not_removed,there are several layers to that question each with a sooner likely date a microbial if we are lucky that could happen right now microbes may exist on mars or some icy outer planet moons in this solar system and probes might detect them or sufficiently convincing byproducts of their activity but we cant possibly know the likelihood of it being there so its hitormiss b global ecosystems the next generation of telescopes will be able to do spectroscopy of atmospheres of some potentially interesting planets and if we are lucky might find gas chemistries that are not known to be sustainable without biochemistry taking place this would take some luck because its just on the edge of detectability for the next generation but the generation after that will have much more extensive capability so over the next years or so we will get to check perhaps hundreds of planets for these signatures thats still a small sample so i wouldnt bet on finding it then with the generation after that call it years that sample size might be tens of thousands as we can not only look deeper but the numbers of known planets keep expanding i would be confident we will find a living world through telescope spectroscopy within years we wont know a lot about it though other than some basics of chemistry wont be able to know if its very complex or just seas of living sludge c animal life much more speculative at this point but detecting nontechnological animal life would be considerably more far out long periods of time deducing their existence from respiration gases would be needed as well as observing surface changes that are best explained by animal activity probably a topic for the next century if i were to hazard a guess for when such a thing might be observed it would be when we have detected simpler living worlds in large numbers it might be a very long time before we find one with animal life we can deduce we might start to wonder if fermis paradox is due to bottlenecks in animal evolution while simpler forms are easy d technological intelligence if we ever find eti the most likely method would be detection of largescale activity very far away not a signal but simply technology in operation affecting a celestial body we might never find that we might find it in a million years or we might find it years from now its unknowable the scenario i find most probable is that scientists would spend generations furiously arguing about whether it even is eti slowly building more data and very gradually meeting consensus that it is a civilization but it would be too far away and too weird to do anything with the information other than build bigger and more powerful telescopes to gather more data and we could keep doing that for thousands of years after initial detection before we actually figured anything out about it shrug
space,not_removed,im far from knowledgeable of any statistics concerning this subject but id have to say that were currently as close as weve ever been to finding extraterrestrial life
space,not_removed,logically that question cannot be answered until we actually find extraterrestrial life we cant know how close we were until we actually find it
space,not_removed,every day brings us closer to find out if there is extraterrestrial life out there or not but until then the chances of actually finding out are rather slim not sure if the odds improve as we get better technology or as we scan more space
space,not_removed,not until humans start traveling to other planets or other star systems in other words deep space traveling which right now its not happening
space,not_removed,if there is intelligent life out there in a form like usor anything else that will freak us out even more i hope they dont allow us to go too far we are a cancer that needs curing we cant even get on with each other so there is little hope of us getting on with anything that is out there we have made enough mess on this planet that we have now i read a comment on the seti announcement that the civilisation would be so far advanced seriously we cant even stab at this as we are judging others by a standard that we understand there may be laws of physics and other stuff we havent even scratched on so i really dont see how we can even make an educated guess at this point
space,not_removed,what would your definition of finding life be would detecting an atmosphere consistent with life qualify would we need to directly observe it etc
space,not_removed,you mean the mass media the global audience yes we are close to finding it
space,not_removed,i personally think were still decades if not centuries away from finding anything that would resemble any extraterrestrial life if it exists at all it is definitely nowhere to be found in our solar system otherwise we would already have something those mars pictures to me look like just a bunch of rocks or sand hills shaped as an animals or people however i do believe that the life might exist somewhere but it might not be in any form that we would expect not the life as we know it we say that the water is essential for any life form but i believe it might not be completely true just because life on earth needs water andor oxygen doesnt mean that it is a requirement for other forms of life that might exist somewhere out there just an opinion
space,not_removed,i was talking about the microbial possibilities on mars with a couple friends and if you think about it well definitely take samples of them if we find them and bring them back to study wed be committing alien abductions
space,not_removed,well there are two possibilities either we never find any and were as close as weve ever been and ever will be or we will find it and were always closer than weve ever been
space,not_removed,im referring more to tangible evidence than possibility
space,not_removed,carbon and water chauvinism are somewhat justified by the unique properties of these molecules carbonbased organics are more plausible thanany other and water is a very handy solvent in which icebergs float rather thank sink however considering you arent too picky on conditions why do you for example dismiss the possibility of aerial or subglacial life the former is possible on venus and any of the gas giants while the latter leaves us with a whole lot of moons to pick from after all only mars has been adequately explored to rule out life
space,not_removed,if you arent already familiar the fermi paradox wiki has a bunch of good discussion in a similar vein
space,not_removed,thats just as cryptic what would you consider tangible evidence for microbial or nontechnological life on a planet orbiting another star for example
space,not_removed,i dont dismiss it i guess i said it wrong what i meant is that life as we know it is nowhere to be found in our solar system
space,not_removed,i remember reading dumb websites when i was a kid where paranoid people would talk about the lens flares on the pictures and claim that they were alien structures
space,not_removed,thats great
space,not_removed,yeah no a senator wouldnt be satisfied until a full breakdown of the porkspreading is produced
space,not_removed,whats going on here nasas juno mission which launched in will enter orbit around jupiter on july the mission is primarily devoted to studying the magnetosphere gravity field and deep interior of jupiter so no visible light scientific instruments although thankfully the probe has a small camera called junocam for public engagement what youre seeing in my gif is the trajectory the spacecraft will take bringing it extremely close to jupiter before the engines fire although junocam isnt the most powerful camera in the world with pixels due to its close proximity to jupiter perijove is less than the diameter of mercury above the cloud tops the resolution will reach kmpixel which is times better then anything weve had before expect spectacular images like but even higher resolution and junos trajectory lies along jupiters terminator sunset so expect beautiful long shadows highlighting height differences in the cloud belts the public will be able to vote on points of interest for the probe to image on httpswwwmissionjunoswriedujunocam voting will probably start a month out days because that makes sense however junocam isnt a scientific instrument and so doesnt get the radiation protection the other instruments get meaning it is built to last just orbits months edit while people are understandably angry at nasas decision to put a mediocre camera on juno id like to point out that junos images will in fact be scientifically valuable due to their unprecedented resolution and the camera itself has the same power that new horizons best camera had and nobody complained about that p
space,not_removed,so juno is gonna be in a polar orbit or am i look at the gif wrong
space,not_removed,created using nasas eyes software which is a really useful and frequently updated resource that tends to be more accurate then anything else you can find online for the new horizons encounter they programmed literally every twist and turn the spacecraft did and showed the cameras taking every single image they took

space,not_removed,as much as i love space i get extremely uncomfortable seeing a planet up close large pictures of it real or not real makes me grip my chair as if i was approaching it myself however irrational that may be
space,not_removed,how is juno approaching jupiter to make this polar orbit was it launched such that it would just approach jupiter this way and if so id love to hear how is it incliningdeclining its orbit as it approaches oh and if you have the time id be interested to hear how the jovian moons affected all of this
space,not_removed,im an engineer who worked on the fault protection system for juno if i did an ama would people be interested
space,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrlivvenwikigifvbot
space,not_removed,it really bugs me that i didnt know what juno was it bugs me even more that i dont know more of the missions going on with nasa
space,not_removed,so why do we even bother sending a camera there if we already know what itll see
space,not_removed,correct me if im wrong but that view was from pole to pole is that how it will enter orbit going over the top or bottom of jupiter
space,not_removed,is jupiter the one with the weird hexagon or is that saturn google seems to have them very confused either way we should get some fucking sweet aurora pictures
space,not_removed,wanna make this go front page and get a few more people interested in space end the gif with a subtle dickbut and then submit it to rgifs
space,not_removed,so jupiters navel just kidding this is fantastic is there a way to see the earth as seen from the moon i wish we had webcams on the moon
space,not_removed,whats the time lag between jupiter and earth theyre are going to be some tense engineers and scientists waiting for that telemetry
space,not_removed,thank you for taking the time to do this for us to see its amazing just how far space exploration has come in regards to the discovery and exploration of celestial planets
space,not_removed,this is a shame why send a spacecraft over just to see cgi images of the planet s seriously though thanks for enlightening us
space,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment a lot of it is just a pr program juno was originally designed solely for geophysics research and once members of the public started asking why isnt there a camera nasa decided to add one at the last minute the camera itself is a mod not from the moon but heres a website with live images of earth from a japanese satellite that updates every minutes and of course theres the iss livestream as of when im typing this the stream is down for a brief period of time which i fyi you could probably make a prettier representation in elite galileo v god now that beatles song is stuck in my head im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf
space,not_removed,this is pretty exciting ive always thought jupiter to be the most interesting planet its sheer size and the composition and movement of the clouds on its atmosphere has always seemed fascinating to me every once in a while ill spend hours looking at pictures of jupiter and artistic renditions of what being inside its atmosphere might look like it seems like such a mysterious planet to me i cant wait to see pictures from juno
space,not_removed,cant wait for the pictures of this i just want to see what the clouds look like even closer up
space,not_removed,well shit sorry alaska i didnt even know an entire city could just up and move like that
space,not_removed,this might be a dumb question but how is studying jupiter of use to us
space,not_removed,in how is any space mission not launching with a extremely high resolution camera if the public is funding it we should get our new work desktops
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,how they calculate the trajectory of the satellite with jupiters gravity field
space,not_removed,i remember juno lifting off and thinking this will be the biggest flop of a nasa mission because no one thought of how the public would react to no visible light cameras on bird this will be a hard pr sell
space,not_removed,why wouldnt they strap a better camera on it just for fun to get pretty pictures if nothing else i mean you go all the freaking way to jupiter might as well put a few gopros on it
space,not_removed,it will see a really shitty resolution gif of a poorly made artists rendition of passing by jupiter thats very interesting indeed
space,not_removed,i got uncomfortable with how close the fake jupiter was getting to me on my monitor i dont even know how that works
space,not_removed,junocam images of earth starts out pretty rough but gets better httpswwwmissionjunoswriedumediagalleryjunocam
space,not_removed,thank you i was a bit unclear on whether juno was a probe man made or natural satellite or one of jupiters moons got it
space,not_removed,man that explanation kicked ass thank you dude
space,not_removed,orbits months oh wow i thought an orbit would be much much fasterespecially given how close juno will pass to the cloud tops the probe seems to slow down a lot at the far parts of the orbit then
space,not_removed,your posts are fantastic thanks for being so educational and awesome at explaining things
space,not_removed,so my comment is another worless comment but i just need to say thank you
space,not_removed,what do they expect to learn from junos pictures i mean they wont put a camera however small and cheap if they dont expect to get some valuable data from it or is it just for the pretty pictures for the press
space,not_removed,every time i read about juno i go into a mild depression i really really wish they could have put some modern semigood cameras on it after cassini i figured the value of a stellar imaging system would be obvious its just sad what couldve been
space,not_removed,wont it be destroyed by the atmosphere or is it not flying that low
space,not_removed,is there any chance the junocam will deliver images from one of jupiters moons i know the juno mission is not focusing on the moons but maybe coincidentally a close approach and a picture moment appears
space,not_removed,people are also angry that nasa did not fly a europa probe years ago and even today nasa hq is dragging its feet on this missions why because there is no possible manned mission spinoff unlike mars and nasa is run by the manned mission lobby
space,not_removed,how long after it enters obit should we expect to start seeing public images i know nasa releases just about everything publicly but i cant remember what the turn around time on that sort of thing is
space,not_removed,why wouldnt they slap a decent smartphone camera on there ive owned cellphones with sensors that take mind boggling images for what they are and theyre tiny why would they opt for something with such small resolution when there are much better options
space,not_removed,nasa create a billiondollar mission put a cheapass webcam on the thing to give the shitbag scrubs their shitty pictures the pictures are all we really care about
space,not_removed,why not attach morebetter cameras i dont understand sometimes it really looks as though holding things off keeps the folks involved employed longer
space,not_removed,if it holds up like the mars rovers well be just fine
space,not_removed,does it bother anyone else that my cellphone camera was better like seriously how could they not spare the extra or grams that a better camera would have taken
space,not_removed,yep a highly inclined highly eccentric orbit however the perijove closest point to jupiter will be over the equatorial region so well get to see the north pole equator and south pole in times better resolution then anything before
space,not_removed,i thought it was space engine sure looks like it
space,not_removed,agreed experiencing that in person must be fucking terrifying
space,not_removed,yes the spacecraft was launched during the jupiter launch window of and then the trajectory was refined so that the spacecraft would pass over jupiter and its moons is the view from the spacecraft at this very second and you can see how the spacecraft will be passing above the planet httpiimgurcomqcymnqfpng the view a few hours before closest approach on july i think there will be a slight inclination increase either at the orbit burn or a later burn because httpiimgurcomdqfirtrpng has a trajectory that follows jupiters terminator which is different to the initial entry trajectory on july which passes over the night side i have no idea what the purpose of the terminatorfollowing orbit is it cant be a coincidence because juno has deliberately been placed that way there must be a reason either way well get some really pretty pictures of cloud structures casting long shadows as for the moons they play essentially no role their gravitational effect on the spacecraft is minuscule compared to jupiters due to the highly inclined highly eccentric orbit the spacecraft never gets remotely near to them either i got this info the pictures and the gif from nasas eyes software which is free and is a really useful and accurate tool
space,not_removed,with a trajectory toward a distant planetary body even the slightest alteration in trajectory angle could drastically alter or cause it to entirely miss the intercept point
space,not_removed,is it incliningdeclining its orbit as it approaches not exactly the crafts trajectory is planned so that it goes over one of jupiters poles instead of over its equator the difference between those two trajectories is very small in terms of energy requirements
space,not_removed,yes people will be very interested although id time it for the day of orbital insertionday before
space,not_removed,do you work in pasadena ill be in the media room at jpl on july for the arrival
space,not_removed,get a bunch of you guys together and do it
space,not_removed,check httpseyesnasagovdsndsnhtml out from time to time it shows what the big radio dishes used to communicate with missions outside earth orbit are doing in real time its where i first heard of juno
space,not_removed,ive never seen a problem easier to fix head to nasagov and start reading
space,not_removed,you shut your mouth i have been waiting for a long time for close up pictures of ol jupes
space,not_removed,boy if i was nasa id be feeling pretty stupid about now
space,not_removed,so why do we even bother sending a camera there if we already know what itll see haha we dont know what well see because this time well see more detail then we did before
space,not_removed,yes junos orbit is a polar orbit so we will see not only the equator but also the north and south pole and the bright aurora there
space,not_removed,its gorgeous
space,not_removed,that would be saturns north pole
space,not_removed,not from the moon but heres a website with live images of earth from a japanese satellite that updates every minutes and of course theres the as of when im typing this the stream is down for a brief period of time which i have as my screensaver
space,not_removed,jupiter is at about au so between and minutes
space,not_removed,jupiter is a big ass gas planet whose gravity is so great it actually helps keep earth safe from comets plus her moons are mysterious
space,not_removed,jupiter is thought to have been the first planet in the solar system to form which made it incredibly important in the evolution of the solar system yet we know almost nothing about its interior we have so many questions about what the inside of jupiter looks like and different models for the formation of the solar system predict different interiors so by understanding the deep interior of jupiter we can learn more about how the solar system earth and ultimately other solar systems form
space,not_removed,you could say that about any space mission it will study the interior of the planet and learn how gas giants form and we might learn a lot about the begining of our solar system if thats not exciting for you then yea its useless to you but for scientist this is gonna be a great mission and an insight into our past
space,not_removed,the largest planets in a solar system form first then the smaller ones come next this means jupiters the first planet in our system the more we know about it and its formation the more we know about the origin of our solar system
space,not_removed,this might be a dumb question but how is studying jupiter of use to us same way that studying anything that we dont yet know contributes to understanding the general principals by which the universe and everything in it works
space,not_removed,why does there have to be a use for us a lot of tech that goes into all nasa craft trickles down to consumer goods
space,not_removed,a bit late but this only popped into my inbox now irrelevant to the mission junos mission is equipped to study the deep interior of jupiter a camera wasnt even considered until the last second radiation shielding a big heavy camera needs thick radiation protection to ensure it doesnt die in a few months from jupiters radiation increasing the mass of the spacecraft and mass means everything money juno launched at the very worst time in the history of planetary science funding ever its really not that bad it has greater resolution then new horizons best camera which makes sense since they were built at around the same time juno was built in the mid and was originally supposed to launch in but funding issues delayed that and i didnt see anybody complaining about the pluto pictures
space,not_removed,with lots of math and good computers
space,not_removed,you need to play kerbal space program
space,not_removed,it has a camera junocam however its not a scientific instrument and is purely for public engagement
space,not_removed,this is not what jupiter will actually look like just how the software displays it also they only brought a crappy camera because of weight and pr if it were fully up to the juno team they wouldnt bring an optical camera at all
space,not_removed,they are reusing a spare camera from curiosity nasa wont just use something off the shelf radiation might fry it before it ever reached jupiter
space,not_removed,might as well put a few gopros on it gopros wont survive jupiters radiation belts
space,not_removed,its not an artists rendition its a map of jupiter from real images on a nasabuilt simulation software called nasas eyes and we dont have better resolution because we havent sent a spacecraft close to jupiter since juno will solve that
space,not_removed,httpiimgurcomkusdvtfgifv jupiter is easily the most scary planet in the solar system but tbh ive never seen a bouncer that is not scary guess its their job
space,not_removed,that highres comp photo is terrifying in a way im not sure i can describe seeing tothemile definition of storms on jupiter is something im not ready for but will plunge into anyway highres modern space pictures blow my mind its never old
space,not_removed,its interesting i didnt experience that with the pluto simulation but did here theres something about jupiter in particular the vastness and violence of it imagining being that close to those cloud tops and storms made me squirm a bit but its going to be spectacular to see even if some of the images are a little uncomfortable
space,not_removed,i thought i was the only one renderings where the camera enters large gravity wells give me the creeps so do rendered images of large celestial bodies close to earth like those what would the sky look like if jupiter were the same distance from earth as the moon type images
space,not_removed,yeah that camera friggin blows its better than no camera but its comically bad for a space probe it honestly makes my heart hurt every time i am reminded of it and what couldve been
space,not_removed,good lord would it really have jacked up the cost that much to install a decent camera on the thing
space,not_removed,well something doesnt add up now
space,not_removed,indeed i thought zeus had been drinking again
space,not_removed,thank you i was a bit unclear on whether juno was one of jupiters moons how would it be entering orbit if it was already a moon
space,not_removed,so if we already know what its going to see why did we spend all that money
space,not_removed,yes the orbit takes it from just above jupiters cloud tops to all the way out past callisto
space,not_removed,as orbital altitude increases velocity decreases when the orbits look you can bet its going quite slow out at perijove apojove
space,not_removed,thats how all orbits work
space,not_removed,a lot of it is just a pr program juno was originally designed solely for geophysics research and once members of the public started asking why isnt there a camera nasa decided to add one at the last minute the camera itself is a modified version of the the main difference is that the sensors been reprogrammed to work with a spinning spacecraft and the electronics have been moved to a thicker case to give the sensor a bit more radiation protection that said it will have some scientific value at its best junocam will be acquiring images with a resolution of kmpixel and we havent gotten many images with that kind of resolution since the voyager flybys in galileo had a few but due to that spacecrafts bandwidth issues it didnt return a lot its also going to be taking pictures of the polar regions which nasas only had a clear direct view of only once those images taken by pioneer arent great by todays standards juno will have an order of magnitude improvement on image resolution in those polar views also scientists are clever with finding uses for new data sets even though junocam was added without a specific investigation in mind someone somewhere will find a use for the images it could be getting a better handle on jupiters atmospheric dynamics or looking for previously unobserved cloud types or even something that turns up in the images that was totally unexpected when the mission started
space,not_removed,well to be fair cassinis main camera is only megapixel many of the images that you see from cassini are generally mosaics made from hundreds of captures
space,not_removed,too bad survival of the species be damned gotta have more fighter jets right
space,not_removed,youd probably post the pictures for karma wouldnt you
space,not_removed,jupiter is fucking gigantic appearing much closer than it actually is
space,not_removed,funnily enough thats how the juno is set to end with the craft falling into the planet
space,not_removed,the atmosphere only officially extends up to km and juno will be flying times higher than that
space,not_removed,unfortunately juno never gets close enough to the moons to image them in detail its mediocreresolution camera doesnt help either at the closest possible distance the probe could ever get to io just pixels
space,not_removed,it enters orbit on july and images will be released almost immediately because its a public engagement instrument
space,not_removed,radiation mostly i would imagine put one of those phones near jupiter and itll stop working completely something with as fine a resolution packed into a tiny ccd would be pretty susceptible to damage
space,not_removed,how well does your phone works at °c
space,not_removed,juno is not a visible light spacecraft its mission is to study the deep interior of jupiter not its atmosphere and so we only got a camera to get the public engaged mass means everything on juno more particular because every large scientific instrument has to have heavy expensive radiation shielding so they opted for a smaller camera with no shielding money the spacecraft was actually built it was originally supposed to launch in but budget cuts delayed that to
space,not_removed,because that is not the primary mission or provides the science that the juno team is focused on also important to bear in mind is that juno is the first space probe to use solar panels as its main source of power in the outer solar system and even with some of the best solar panels available the amount of sunlight that juno receives is a fraction of what you would get in the inner solar system cameras are very energy consuming not just for taking images but also in transmitting said images in this case close to a billion miles away from earth so in order to get more and better quality cameras that would survive long enough to justify their use you would have to provide adequate shielding and power to use them which increases the costs of the mission considerable and all for a function that is a secondly concern for nasa in this mission
space,not_removed,two reasons mainly scientific scope if this is designed to study magnetosphere and gravity thats what it should study providing visible light closeup imaging of the external surface isnt relevant or add much to the mission cost both in development testing craft redesign transmission and processing images not to mention extra weight massive increase in fuel costs getting out of our atmosphere and to jupiter its pretty far away someone decided getting another external photo just isnt worth the work and cost
space,not_removed,radiation basically even though junocam isnt as well radiation shielded as other instruments jupiter is a super radioactive environment it is still radiationhardened a standard image sensor would get ripped to pieces by the radiation in interplanetary space
space,not_removed,someday soon someone will fund a live feed from jupiter obviously with a minute delay
space,not_removed,it wont the mars rovers were built to withstand the environment that they are in for a long period of time they were designed with wide margins so that nasa could be nearly sure that they would last at least the planned mission duration in this case junocam was a late addition to the spacecraft that is not part of the primary mission at all and because of that it isnt properly radiationshielded for jupiter it might last a little longer than predicted but i seriously doubt that well see the kind of longevity that weve seen in the mars rovers
space,not_removed,because your cell phone camera probably wouldnt have made the trip to there reliability comes first here you also have to think about data transfer to earth and storage
space,not_removed,juno is not a visible light spacecraft its mission is to study the deep interior of jupiter not its atmosphere and so we only got a camera to get the public engaged mass means everything on juno more particular because every large scientific instrument has to have heavy expensive radiation shielding so they opted for a smaller camera with no shielding money the spacecraft was actually built it was originally supposed to launch in but budget cuts delayed that to
space,not_removed,i dont have that game nasas eyes is free and more accurate how could i possibly input a trajectory for a spacecraft into a game that doesnt even simulate gravity properly
space,not_removed,for how long do you plan to take these awesome pictures
space,not_removed,exactly what i thought i tried to do something similar but ended up well dead
space,not_removed,its just that all those space simulators look like space
space,not_removed,i guess its just hard to imagine an entire world just being in front of you like that way too jarring lol
space,not_removed,i have no idea what the purpose of the terminatorfollowing orbit is one of the reasons is so that it will be in sunlight all the time never being obscured by jupiter even at the closest approach it can point its solar panels at the sun and take measurements with its instruments at the same time
space,not_removed,looking at these maps its like im playing ksp and interestingly enough i recently launched a jupiter probe based off of juno i have it saved so i can do the encounter in lockstep with the real juno with rss this should be fun and also painfully slow and boring
space,not_removed,the position at the terminator is probably to keep the solar panels in sunlight all the time
space,not_removed,if i had to guess a terminator orbit gives you the broadest range of conditions as well as letting you perform tests on the entire surface eventually what im really curious about now is what those course refinements were thanks for the info sidenote im not entirely convinced nasas eyes isnt just kerbal
space,not_removed,theres more to it than that of course at best a launch from earth unrefined could only take an orbit with a diagonal orbit around another planet they orbit they propose for juno is very specific and unlikely to occur from just a simple launch so there must be a refinement according to the op they just plan on coming in at an angle then burning to refinement
space,not_removed,jois gonna be on of july so ill be off work at least
space,not_removed,denver area actually was built by lockheed martin here we were building the systems for juno and grail moon mission at the same time lots of common code well be watching on nasa tv
space,not_removed,already planning a joi party ill see if i can get a few former coworkers to come a bit early or at least participate remotely
space,not_removed,thanks man i know everything that nasa does is public i just never really felt compelled to check out their missions until now
space,not_removed,ohhh jupes is good i usually refer to it as jp to my friends and they never have any idea what im talking about haha
space,not_removed,def got an audible chuckle reading both the comment and good ol jupes
space,not_removed,i too like jupes if youll pardon my french
space,not_removed,heres a close up i took from my backyard httpsiimgurcomywllayujpg
space,not_removed,yeah that is really pretty i hereby declare it a sexagon on account of how sexy it is
space,not_removed,mmmmm looks like a galactic boob
space,not_removed,do you perhaps know which probe took this picture
space,not_removed,we need way more of those satellites with a live view of the earth
space,not_removed,yeah but what is the science is it how light bends from the gravity like a black hole or do they spectate objects that collide into the planet
space,not_removed,since my last comment is below threshold im leaving a new one to explain a bit my position first of all im interested in junocams value further than its public engagement objective its a visible spectrum camera on the most massive planet of the solar system if we are lucky it might capture an impact up close and personal and provide planetary scientists footage far better than what any enthusiastic redditor can kudos to ububbleweed hes amazing having that kind of data would be very interesting as it allow to test and see parts of the atmosphere that are normally out of reach for scientific instruments as youve said its a camera for public engagement and its going to give better images than the already amazing new horizons cassini galileo and voyager footage we have from the past but the orbit is not apropriate for imaging of the moons since its a widefield camera and not being a priority communications bandwidth for images will be constrained so its also unclear how many images will be obtained from each orbit from the planetary society link for example if io were directly above juno it would be at a distance of about kilometers and resolution would be kilometers per pixel so the whole satellite would only be about pixels across the other moons will be even farther away im not saying jupiter isnt an interesting target but people get engaged with the galilean moons and this mission will not deliver in that aspect httpsenwikipediaorgwikijunocam
space,not_removed,which will get fried as soon as people start looking at the pictures coming back from it well not quite like that hopefully people will hear from it soon enough still getting the instrument people like the most to be fried early in the mission is going to be a big blow to the missions pr team if theres such a thing
space,not_removed,just like sarcasm wont survive on reddit threads p
space,not_removed,facts there really is no better rebuke than applying them smartly with the back of ones hand
space,not_removed,jupiter is easily the most scary planet in the solar system id personally choose saturn even missing it could kill you encounter a ring particle but for real fun skip planets and go for the giant constantly fusing plasma ball at the center that thing hurts me from time to time even from around where i live
space,not_removed,is that just a massive hurricane thats rolling across its surface
space,not_removed,i remember locking on to the centre of the milky way on space engine and pressing the zoom button i honestly nearly cried from fear
space,not_removed,gotta keep costs down there need to be compromises i guess
space,not_removed,what could have been
space,not_removed,also probably no pictures of europa nasa is allergic of europa it is as if they are afraid of what they will find there ie funding will be diverted from manned missions to robotic europa missions
space,not_removed,think about it this way the probe actually has to send the images back to us for them to be useful itd be better to have a shitty camera that can actually send the images back than having a high ass quality camera thatd take a fuckton of effort and energy to send really good images back to us
space,not_removed,hey man matt damon spent a lot of time growing that potato on that orbiter
space,not_removed,worse than an equivalent smartphone camera of
space,not_removed,seriously couldnt have been more than a few thousand dollars for the part itself and testing which was going to happen anyway might be a little more expensive
space,not_removed,red spot is three times the diameter of earth
space,not_removed,thats jupiter for you you wannabe sokrates roma invicta
space,not_removed,strangely enough that is the backstory of the game katamari damacy
space,not_removed,thats a very good question im wondering now how i also missed that part of the title because i too wasnt sure if juno was a moon of jupiter or something we sent there
space,not_removed,my brain can be stupid from time to time i guess it deemed that part unimportant stupid brain
space,not_removed,because people are learning new things every second of every minute of every hour of every day
space,not_removed,we know what we are pointing at we dont know what we will see when we get there and it was already stated the visual camera is not its main science i think that juno is actually going to dip into the atmosphere but i may have read the info wrong
space,not_removed,dont you mean apojove i was not aware just how excentric the orbits actually are but i guess a necessary evil as it would seem to be very expensive to achieve a more circular orbit
space,not_removed,fantastic answer thank you very much
space,not_removed,says its designed to only handle a few orbits before dying watch the camera will survive for like years
space,not_removed,juno was originally designed solely for geophysics research and once members of the public started asking why isnt there a camera nasa decided to add one at the last minute i hope thats a lesson learned the vast majority of taxpayers — the customers — cant comprehend a space mission that doesnt return pictures no bucks no buck rogers
space,not_removed,thats true i believe cassini has a really good zoom though right how good are the optics of the junocam
space,not_removed,thats how galileo ended and how cassini will end next year in saturns atmo they are worried that if they just let it orbiting it could crash into one of the moons and possibly contaminate it and with cassini we will get pics from under the rings so thats gonna be cool
space,not_removed,thanks for the detailed reply too bad that this mission doesnt focus on the moons at all i guess we have to wait for the real httpsenwikipediaorgwikijupitericymoonexplorer just wait until the httpsenwikipediaorgwikieuropamultipleflybymission might be a bit earlier though if it can use sls or a launch system with even higher performance rspacex should be able to help us in the
space,not_removed,yes sorry i didnt mean an actual cell phone i just meant a cell phone sized camera but as mentioned in one of the replies to my comment the year it was built makes sense as to its resolutionsize
space,not_removed,clearly i dont mean toss a phone in the probe and be done with it i meant there are much better options for the size if its for public engagement why not put something better for the same size and weight
space,not_removed,fair point i didnt mean a literal cell phone in the probe but the year it was built does make sense thank you
space,not_removed,understandable at least theyre still putting a small camera on it
space,not_removed,using technology a better camera than whats on there would have actually weighed less and consumed less power than the camera they put on like literally duct taping a galaxy or iphone camera to the side of it would have been better i cant tell you why that happened but thats the case
space,not_removed,it sounds just barely reasonable but they made a terrible decision and ill call them out on it the excuse is lousy and dumb
space,not_removed,you want public engagement attach a camera camera all the the things
space,not_removed,lousiest excuse i guess from the professionals perspective it makes sense to call it unnecessary but looking at clean close up photos is the most important part of meothersmostpeople looking forward to the time when juno arrives at jupiter
space,not_removed,juno is not a visible light spacecraft when the public is footing the bill you might want to rethink that its hypocritical of a scientist who probably has pictures of planets on his wall to say that better pictures arent important humans are visual creatures and we want pictures goddammit if you were building a probe and dogs were paying for it would you leave off the smell sensor no you wouldnt because smell is whats important for dogs why would you treat the public who is paying your bills worse than a dog you wouldnt thats how the bottom line is clear more pictures more funding no pictures no funding
space,not_removed,the way the camera was built it is supposed to last months
space,not_removed,playing elite dangerous in vr kind of gives you that sense it just sorta keeps getting bigger and bigger and it feels like youll never reach the surface and then you crash
space,not_removed,looking at your feet must be a terrifying experience
space,not_removed,scotscott not scott manley
space,not_removed,i believe they can also study the atmosphere better if they would have put a good camera on it at least
space,not_removed,its your back yard in the astroid belt by any chance
space,not_removed,coincidentally sex is the swedish word for the number six and for sex
space,not_removed,most of the gorgeous pictures of saturn you see are from cassini
space,not_removed,ok ill try to explain the best i can youll probably know a lot of this already yes its same thing with the light gravity curves your path like if you put a big rock on a trampoline and then sent a small ball around it it would curve this is whats happening jupiters immense gravity curves the spacecrafts path the other way in relation to jupiter that is now if juno wouldnt do anything it would just fly past jupiter and that was it what juno is gonna do is get to the lowest point in its path and fire its engines to slow down this will insert it to an orbit around jupiter
space,not_removed,just to add to this i read the very same planetary society article and produced which is the maximum possible resolution junocam could image io at just so people know what to expect
space,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikijunocam junocam or jcm is the visiblelight cameratelescope of the juno jupiter orbiter a nasa space probe to the planet jupiter launched on august it was built by malin space science systems due to telecommunications constraints juno will only be able to return about megabytes of camera data during each orbital period this will limit the number of images that are captured and transmitted during each orbit to somewhere between and this may be comparable to the galileo mission which captured thousands of images despite its slow data rate due to antenna problems i am a bot please contact httpswwwredditcomusergregmartinez with any questions or feedback
space,not_removed,its been designed to last for orbits which is over months and thats only the minimum the engineers expect it to last longer than that they also have a really cool httpswwwmissionjunoswriedujunocam set up where the public will be able to vote for what targets junocam will image next
space,not_removed,it would require extra fuel due to the added weight of a camera the electronics for the camera and the extra power for the camera etc on top of that it would take up space on juno itself require extra work to make sure everything works properly take away time from the actual experiments themselves and so on its not like just throwing a camera in your badg on a trip
space,not_removed,a cellphone camera capable of better resolution than the one they put on there cost under bucks and weighs grams
space,not_removed,id personally choose the giant constantly fusing plasma ball at the center yeah but thats not a planet p
space,not_removed,yeah its the great red spot giant storm bigger than the earth thats been around for at least years is something
space,not_removed,pictures really awesome pictures that we will not have
space,not_removed,honestly youre dead on they dont seem to want to go there at all concress is throwing the money at nasa than what theyve requested and theyre still dragging their feet congress is willing to fully fund probes orbiter and lander to launch in and but nasa still grumbles about it to me thats the most exciting mission since the original voyager probes
space,not_removed,of course but weve put better cameras on older cheaper probes in the past and transmitted from a lot further with lower transfer rates juno doesnt have much of an issue with transferring information jupiter is fairly close and juno is in a highly elliptic orbit it has plenty of time to transmit compressed images they should have gotten the funding to put a lorri or equivalent imager even though itll be at a distance it would have been nice to take some observations of the moons with junocam itll have a much lower resolution that what the hubble can take of the moons
space,not_removed,have an average smartphone camera survive years in space vacuum cosmic radiation temperatures in twodigit kelvin range
space,not_removed,they dont use normal cameras they have to be specially designed a better camera would be in the millions more expensive
space,not_removed,launch cost for the extra weight dominates the cost of even the specialized instruments used for actual scientific data this thing had to be very small and very resilient and resolution obviously suffers in trade its not a mission necessity so compromising other features of the probe to improve this one would be counterproductive
space,not_removed,your point
space,not_removed,naaaaa na na na na na na na naa na na na na na na
space,not_removed,that doesnt make sense for something to be a moon it would already have to be in orbit of a planet you cant be a moon and be entering orbit at the same time you can become a moon that way but you cant have already been one
space,not_removed,havent we launched a probe into the atmosphere didnt it like dissolve edit it was either jupiter or saturn pretty sure
space,not_removed,well in the case of jupiter an eccentric orbit makes a lot of sense they really wouldnt want to be so close to jupiter for very long periods because of the planets radiation
space,not_removed,yes a very insidersanswer i love these great
space,not_removed,to be fair nasa has flown plenty of other missions without cameras before most recently the maven mission i think a junocamlike cameras are a good compromise going forward i think people underestimate just how much a voyager or cassinilike camera costs in terms of money mass and power requirements the telescopes used for those cameras were the largest instruments on those spacecraft while developing a camera system with the appropriate light responses for scientific analysis is really expensive tacking that kind of system onto juno which was designed to be a lowcost lowmass probe would have been the difference between going and not going
space,not_removed,precisely i remember reading somewhere that on the off chance there is life on titan they dont want to accidentally kill it
space,not_removed,technology that goes into a probe or even in the iss is obsolete its the same for the cern as everything need to be tested approved and retested juno launched in the teams working on its science equipement where probably already developping their experience when galileo was still orbiting jupiter
space,not_removed,resolution of that camera
space,not_removed,the purpose of the probe is to do science not give you pretty pictures a camera would be useless for the science its doing so theres really no reason for it being there besides giving the public nice pictures stop acting so entitled and that resolution is the same as the camera on new horizons and i dont see anybody complaining about those photos resolution isnt everything
space,not_removed,thats exactly why they tagged basically a webcam on their mission to study other things about the planet
space,not_removed,then look at the beautiful pictures that voyager and hubble have taken of the planet
space,not_removed,though equipment expected to last through similar windows have occasionally lasted much longer
space,not_removed,i played elite dangerous in vr last night and it took my breath away
space,not_removed,well when you think about it were basically sitting on a giant ball of molten rock with an eggshell of relatively safe crust on top of it
space,not_removed,yes were different people other people are good at ksp too
space,not_removed,so you can disprove all the naysayers no amount of evidence will convince these people theyre wrong
space,not_removed,the satellites with that quality of camera are up there but those of us who dont have high level security clearances dont usually get to see the pictures theyre taking
space,not_removed,and this would be the absolutely best case scenario not the usual picture from io every other moon would be just a bunch of pixels
space,not_removed,if i remember correctly the juno pi blew their entire education and public outreach budget on a silly website before it took off which crashed and was a joke among the nasaintheknow community just a prediction and you heard it here first juno will flop in the publics eye a shame since we so seldom make it to the outer solar system
space,not_removed,and would get absolutely fucked by radiation
space,not_removed,except radiation would fry it in seconds jupiter gives off more radiation then it receives from the sun
space,not_removed,did you miss the skip planets part
space,not_removed,the thing that limits the resolution is probably the amount of data they can send back to earth until the probe dies even if you have some memory on board the spacecraft is only going to survive months the signal we get back from those distances is httpeyesnasagovdsndsnhtml click on goldstone antenna you will see that they currently get from juno i dont know if thats the maximum they can get but it gives an idea of how feeble the signal is keep in mind that the camera isnt the main instrument in this mission so they probably chose the best camera they could afford in terms of bandwidth edit httpsenwikipediaorgwikijunospacecrafttelecommunications
space,not_removed,yeah whats the deal here i remember congress mandating that nasa send a europa lander along with the orbiter and then all i heard from nasa was complaining that a lander would be tough and suddenly all talk of the europa mission even the orbiter only stopped we always complain that nasa wants to do cool stuff but congress wont fund them now its the reverse congress is throwing money at nasa and ordering them to do an even more ambitious mission that nasa originally thought theyd have money for and nasas response is whining and dragging their feet
space,not_removed,bolden wants to avoid another disaster such as the mars curiosity landing or the new horizons pluto these missions were huge gigantic successes and the public loved them but for bolden these missions were terrible because stole the limelight from his manned mission pork projects like sls orion iss and the idiotic asteroid capture mission sorry bolden the public is way more interested in a europa mission than an astronaut playing the guitar or washing her hair on the iss so bolden is doing everything possible to avoid a europa mission at one point congress gave him the money to do it and he diverted it to other projects unbelievable nasa has dragged their feet on europa for fucking years and now they want to push it ut to late it is time for a shakeup in nasa hq get the bums out and put in some scientists from jpl instead of yet another flyboy astronaut
space,not_removed,fair point probably should have taken distance into the equation more into account than i did also just one more question couldnt jupiters gravity actually affect the transfer rate of the information
space,not_removed,out of all the everyday things you could try to use in space a camera sensor might actually work
space,not_removed,the cameras also have to be radiation hardened
space,not_removed,yes the cameras have to be photometric which requires lots of testing to get scientifically useful images but millions i dunno i would guess time was the main factor here
space,not_removed,its a big fucking storm bigger than earth well get to see it up close not impressed
space,not_removed,god now that is stuck in my head
space,not_removed,dont get so hung up on definitions it keeps your mind much more closed my ass is a moon once i pull my pants down and show it to you
space,not_removed,the httpsenwikipediaorgwikigalileoprobe was sent plunging into jupiters atmosphere on a one way trip to get us data
space,not_removed,they added radiation shielding have you never played ksp the goal is keep slinging shit over there until you get the results you want cmon man
space,not_removed,i think people underestimate just how much a voyager or cassinilike camera costs in terms of money mass and power requirements nonsense a camera doesnt cost money it makes money to put it another way if the taxpayers are splurging for a jupiter probe they expect some glorious high resolution posters they can pin to their office and classroom walls im not saying load up a huge heavy telescope or anything but you better have something and it better be at least the same quality as my christmas photos no pictures no funding
space,not_removed,pixels as op said in the thread we are in
space,not_removed,even if the purpose is for scientific research i cant think of a reason why having photographic equipment wouldnt be valuable how can close range visual imaging of a planet that takes years to get to not be valuable
space,not_removed,well new horizons camera was also hooked up to some really bangin optics which made for the high quality images we saw
space,not_removed,dumb move too many phds create dumb blind spots in decision making fucking idiots
space,not_removed,not many of them were spending lots of time in jupiters radiation belts but i hope youre right
space,not_removed,hopefully its like the rover opportunity and just outlives its planned lifetime by years and counting
space,not_removed,this is a bit of a different case though radiation cooks pretty much all unshielded electronics quite quickly and they put very little work into radhardening the camera for juno
space,not_removed,absolutely the game needs a lot more fleshing out but for space buffs its sort of the game youve always dreamed of i love flying up to gas giants and just taking in the scale in vr i cant wait to be able to fly down into them
space,not_removed,ah didnt mean to insinuate anything man dont be offended ijustthoughtmaybeitwashim way to go all the best and hey im not all that bad either man granted i probably cant recreate the juno mission itd be a treat to see you do it
space,not_removed,i really dont think it will flop the camera is functioning the last time they checked and thats not going to change any time soon the website is successful as well with dozens of amateur astronomers sending their images of jupiter in so that the juno team can make maps of the atmosphere that update each week so they know where imaging targets will be and if you think junos bad just you wait for the schiaparelli lander the join esarocosmos mars lander that will land on mars in october this year and if everything goes to plan will be both europe and russias first successful mars lander in history but it doesnt have a camera at all
space,not_removed,people dont seem to understand that this isnt a dinky little planet its a giant
space,not_removed,and the camera thats on it wouldnt
space,not_removed,whats wrong with using the shielding from the camera already on there
space,not_removed,he edited his comment it didnt say that before
space,not_removed,exactly its really strange there seems to be some corruption in nasa currently it seems their manned flight team is cannibalizing the rest im all for both but i think a healthy amount of money should be spend on probes they should launch a billion class probe every years or so billion probe every other and a million probes every year outside that once they get that rhythm going then they can start dumping billions into manned flight
space,not_removed,bolden is totally obsessed with manned spaceflight and could care less about the science missions he is the most worthless admin in decades there are many examples in his state of the union speech was full of all the exciting manned mission that were going to take place in in snore and he did not utter a single peep about the new horizons pluto mission or the dawn ceres mission unbelievable that he could be so out of touch of course as we all know pluto and ceres were huge gigantic successes it must have gone up his butt sideways to see all the publicity for those missions while his stupid asteroid capture mission was yawn city bolden has even tried to totally kill planetary missions when he said no more flagship missions bolden is horrible and it will take a decade or more to undo the damage he has done to planetary science even missions mandated on him he has fucked up he has tried to delay europa to late which means never in nasa speak he royally fucked the mars mission my pulling the lifedetecting sam ii instrument and putting in the idiotic moxie module for generating oxygen for astronauts
space,not_removed,nasa does not want to do cool stuff anymore all nasa hq cares about is feeding the insatiable manned spaceflight lobby so we can yet another iss module inflatable this time or more pork for the rocket to nowhere sls or the clone of the apollo command module orion
space,not_removed,did he really divert it to other projects i didnt even know that was legal i realize you could fudge it a bit but thats a lot of money if true this could make me madder than anything has before
space,not_removed,jupiters gravity no jupiters gravitational effect on light is very very very small it will bend light a bit but the difference in transmission speed would be unmeasurable jupiters radiation belts could have an affect on communication when juno is crossing them although the orbit is designed to reduce this as much as possible and it spends of its time far away from jupiter edit looking into it it looks like junocam will be allocated about mb orbit the orbits last days and at least are expected to be completed depending on compression rates that means between images can be send back per orbit
space,not_removed,they are very squeamish about temperature read up on applying one in smd the amount of care you must put not to fry it whether you use reflow method or a soldering iron is staggering you definitely cant just put it on the board and solder it on with the rest of the elements they arent very good with low temperatures either though the failure modes are less severe usually colors being more or less off
space,not_removed,this camera wasnt so itl get fried sooner or later wikipedia is conflicted about it in one page it says after the orbit in the other after the and somewhere there it also says the engineers are expecting it to resist more but arent sure they arent sure either if image quality will be good because of the intense radiation around jupiter and therell only be some megabytes per orbit dedicated to images because its not important for the mission just public outreach httpsenwikipediaorgwikijunocam httpsenwikipediaorgwikijunospacecraft
space,not_removed,it was added late in development there was never originally supposed to be a camera but the increased weightelectricity radiation hardening testing etc would easily raise the cost rapidly
space,not_removed,what an apt name scientists are cool people
space,not_removed,i have not no ive been meaning to but ive got a pretty large backlog of highly recommended games to look into
space,not_removed,is there an equivalent image someone could provide for what that resolution would look like
space,not_removed,why not attach morebetter cameras i dont understand
space,not_removed,because putting a better camera and giving it the shielding needed to survive a long mission is heavy and because the probe isnt there to take pictures thats just a secondary mission while i would love more pictures of jupiter we do already have a lot from hubble and voyager
space,not_removed,because the purpose of juno is to study the deep internal structure of jupiter not the cloud tops the only part the camera can see we already know a lot about those
space,not_removed,you sound like you dont really know what youre talking about they sent a probe to jupiter they are not idiots you cant just say that not attaching a higher quality camera was a blind spot in decision making youre pulling that out of your ass
space,not_removed,oh that is a bit of a problem isnt it
space,not_removed,unlikely i read that after a year of orbiting they deorbit it crash it into jupiter since its absorbed so much radiation its likely to fail and to avoid hazardous debris contaminating one of jupiters moons
space,not_removed,you will be able to fly down into gas giants
space,not_removed,im not offended i just like being snarky
space,not_removed,just you wait for the schiaparelli lander the join esarocosmos mars lander that will land on mars in october this year the landers surface payload is the meteorological dreams dust characterization risk assessment and environment analyser on the martian surface package consisting of a suite of sensors to measure the wind speed and direction metwind humidity methumi pressure metbaro surface temperature marstem the transparency of the atmosphere optical depth sensor ods and atmospheric electrification atmospheric radiation and electricity sensor microares so basically the stock ksp science kit
space,not_removed,yeah mars is boring to me right now we have a race to show how each rover is larger and more complex than the last in hopes people dont realize how nonrisk taking agencies are to push the envelope the public cant understand the science of curiosity and mars will continue to be a bottleneck for only esoteric science junos public outreach work is repetitive of past citizen science nothing new there this will do nothing compared to galileos contributions to science and culture do you really think juno is relying on random backyard images through a or smaller telescope this is let of the plot of making it seem they involve the public this mission is boring and it shouldnt be its jupiter
space,not_removed,seriously i understand the value in human spaceflight but probes can be done cheaper easier and can do so many things humans cant the idea that the funding for landing something on europa is there and nasa is just ignoring it because it isnt journeytomars is mind boggling
space,not_removed,it must have gone up his butt sideways to see all the publicity for those missions while his stupid asteroid capture mission was yawn city oh lol that arm mission forgot all about that are they even still going to do that i get the sense its been dropped leaving their new glorious sls rocket withwhat one planned mission the exploratory mission where we recreate apollo just because because were not getting the europa mission anymore either it seems he royally fucked the mars mission my pulling the lifedetecting sam ii instrument and putting in the idiotic moxie module for generating oxygen for astronauts ffs i didnt know about this one with all the talk about how mars could have once had life youd think sending a lifedetecting module on mars rover would be high priority but nah because manned missions to mars someday maybe probably not though
space,not_removed,yes he diverted it thank god for the httpplanetaryorg for exposing this congress was not happy with this at all and made him undivert it but they really need to get rid of this dope and all his flyboy friends in nasa hq because he keeps trying to torpedo the europa mission what pisses me off no end is that nasa kept the europa mission on a starvation diet of million a year just for studies for the last years yet in the meantime they peed away money on manned crap things like the iss one year they spent million for a new space toilet for the iss which they bought from russia so it did not even generate any jobs while at the same time the europa mission got about million it shows where their priorities are
space,not_removed,and theres a lot more radiation out there which might mess with sensors i mean it messes with httpsenwikipediaorgwikicosmicrayvisualphenomenas so – without knowing how modern camera sensors work – its reasonable to expect charged particles to cause all sorts of problems with well everything
space,not_removed,they are very squeamish about temperature from what i understand temperature isnt the issue with putting a better camera on this probe the issue is the camera was deemed not important for the mission just public outreach they went with the cheapest piece of crap they could find rather than spend the bit of extra money it would take to give our children great high resolution pictures they could put in their textbooks and classroom walls a shame all around
space,not_removed,as the article notes its a modified camera from a mars mission which means its spacerated already and that means some level of radiationproofing not enough to deal with jupiter indefinitely because thats an even more irradiated environment
space,not_removed,so let me get this straight they were going through all the expense of sending a probe the closest weve ever been to jupiter and not send back high resolution pictures i hope whatever bozo came up with that plan was fired for gross incompetence when it comes to public relations
space,not_removed,i mean you could the cameras they use are also just plain old ccds the difference is that lots of money and research went into understanding exactly how their particular chips respond as a function of luminosity so if they wanted to use an iphone camera theyd have to spend millions to study its behavior to high precision
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,in the parents comment of this thread op provides an example
space,not_removed,megapixels or roughly the equivalent of a phone camera or a midrange digital camera
space,not_removed,to get stuff out that far into space or even just into low earth orbit size is not the main issue weight is to get a small camera into orbit you need more fuel to lift the extra weight you then need more fuel in a lower stage to lift the extra fuel you brought to lift the camera this means that adding even a small amount of mass at the top results in a much larger much more expensive spacecraft we are lucky we even get a visible light camera on juno the additional mass of radiation shielding needed to protect that camera longer than months would make the camera way to expensive and heavy for nasa to justify it
space,not_removed,the masspower limitations for these probes mean that there simply isnt space for every instrument people would like a larger or more power hungry camera means another instrument has to be omitted larger images to be transmitted back to earth mean less bandwidth for other data it isnt so much a question of why not include a better camera its a question of what instruments would you omit to put it in
space,not_removed,its called multitasking they should have affixed better cameras and given a bitter budget probably would have along with infinite other sensors but you have your congressmen to thank for that
space,not_removed,engineer who worked on junos fault protection system here can confirm will be deorbited at end of mission since its solar and not radioactive extended mission would likely be pretty short if any due to power there is an international agreement that spacecraft must be disposed of in a controlled responsible manner before they become potentially dangerous space junk in this case the best option is burning up in the jovian atmosphere ive actually considered doing an ama given how close we are to joi
space,not_removed,maybe its just me but that sounds incredibly awesome
space,not_removed,if the camera survives that along it would be interesting to record the results once it enters the cloud layers before burning to a crisp i heard that most objects burn up before hitting the clouds unless they have considerable mass do you know if thats true
space,not_removed,yep youll also be able to land on rocky planets with atmospheres plants and animals not anytime soon though
space,not_removed,the game has a year plan for feature sets from the ability to walk freely in space stations planets and ships to interacting with npcs and flying into gas giants and all sorts of other features im sure im forgetting people have valid criticisms about developing a game in this manner but i deeply enjoy it and have been very impressed with what theyve added so far and look forward to where they plan to continue the games development you can tell theyve thought very hard about keeping the games engine open for expansion
space,not_removed,although i agree with you that mars is undeservedly sucking all the budget juno is boring p oh come on thats just unfaiiir its the first ever mission dedicated to jupiter and jupiter alone and will change forever our understanding of gas giant interiors and solar system formation once you see the first images of vortexes along jupiters terminator casting their long shadows youll change your mind
space,not_removed,thanks for your positive contributions
space,not_removed,mars is boring to me mars will continue to be a bottleneck for only esoteric science not sure if i missed the sarcasm but if there isnt any then wow what a time we live in where people get to honestly think like this i really dont get how any of this could be boring in any way
space,not_removed,i think that the ridiculous arm asteroid capture stunt is on lifesupport but what other manned stunt will bolden dream up next thanks to bolden the mars mission is a mess the sam ii instrument for the detection of organic chemicals was bumped for the idiotic moxie and as a consolation prize this rover is suppose to drill samples that will be picked up later by a future mission of course this future mission will never be flown probably because of a cost overrun in sls orion program so there you have it a rover with a hobbled instrument suite collecting samples that will never be analyzed and furthermore even if you did send a mission to pick up the samples years or decades later they would be kaput after enduring years of radiation damage mars does have other organic detection instruments but it is obnoxious that the primary instrument was bumped for moxie hell let moxie be run on the iss and take it out of the manned mission budget dont hamstring the mars rover
space,not_removed,yeah that really really does make me sick is there a petition i can sign to get this loon fired im promanned exploration but not at this cost there needs to be a balance here and he seems far from it
space,not_removed,thats absolutely disgusting not only that he diverted it but that theyre behaving as if the iss is more informative than landing on europa iss has kind of run its course in a lot of regards europa is a big deal especially when the mission were talking about includes a lander
space,not_removed,the mardi camera was made for imaging and pointing at the surface of mars as the rover descended thats one marssized radiation shield junocam wont have
space,not_removed,we already sent a probe to jupiter to gather high resolution photos we dont need to do that again what we dont know is the structure of the planet the instruments on it are going to be able to detect quite a lot about how jupiter functions its going to provide excellent science about its magnetic and gravity fields and hopefully showing us what it is like beneath the cloud layer this could provide many clues and information about the origins and formation of gas giants it could give us more insight into the creation of the solar system itself its scale and size of the magnetic and gravity fields could show us details we may not see on earth regarding planetary mechanics the science that will be conducted will be of great value far surpassing anything that would be gathered by adding a better camera and ultimately pr is only slotted in when possible it is never the primary goal of science missions to say that it was incompetence that prevented the addition of one is fundamentally wrong i expect scientists to prioritize science not pretty pictures
space,not_removed,its not just about weight as another commenter pointed out above you need a lot of energy to broadcast data from that far away and the larger the image the more energy is required
space,not_removed,a cellphone camera capable of better resolution weighs grams including the optics
space,not_removed,i was actually just making fun of samslate for not reading the thread at all by following up with a word for word question loop but youve politely added more good explanation to the thread anyways cheers nicely done
space,not_removed,actually i dont im not american and its not just a question of money its to do with the limited amount of power the spacecraft has and the weight budget
space,not_removed,cool thanks for the confirmation will any readings be attempted during its deorbit or is it just a case of cleaning up
space,not_removed,hitting any part of the atmosphere at that speed means instant disintegration cassini for example will pass through gap inside the ring and dive into the clouds at speeds much higher than the material can tolerate everything will be over in a second
space,not_removed,i will admit that sounds tempting perhaps you are right i love space and growing up i loved nasa in recent years ive realized nasa isnt as daring as it once seemed
space,not_removed,well compared to some of the ocean worlds in the solar system europa enceladus titan mars isnt as interesting and you cant deny that mars has been sucking in over half of nasas planetary science budget for decades which is why weve gotten situations like the last discovery class mission competition where in the finalist round nasa chose a stationary mars lander that is no different to the other stationary mars landers other than the fact it has a seismometer insight over time a floating boat that would have sailed the seas of titan and sampled its composition time will never be able to fly again as it had a specific launch window because the mission relied on earth being in the skys of titan and insight ended up being delayed by two years and over budget
space,not_removed,you make a good point there why couldnt moxie be tested on the iss thats the exact type of testexperiment that the iss is for and its absolutely ridiculous to have a rover collect samples for humans to pick up when there are no plans for ever having humans go there to pick them up any time soon or ever
space,not_removed,hopefully hell quit once the next president is elected
space,not_removed,join the httpplanetaryorg they have petitions and httpwwwplanetaryorggetinvolvedbeaspaceadvocate carl sagan started the planetary society to stop the endless poaching of science missions to fund the manned pork and the planetary society is still our best defense against the poaching and shenanigans by bolden and his team of flyboys that run nasa
space,not_removed,youre talking about the pictures that everyone already has posters of right tell you what right now youre losing all your money to manned missions like the iss and mars sex it up a bit and you can get funding for all the gravitic magnotrons you want but unfortunately that means you have to take pictures glorious high resolution pictures of angles we havent seen before pictures that fire the imagination pictures that make space exploration sizzle and pop pictures that make the public want to hang in their classrooms and offices its a tragedy i know you might have to give up an extra gravity sensor but you know what you can put that on the next probe the probe that you will have funding for because it didnt get diverted to the lets have a guy walk on around on mars and do less science than a robot could do project
space,not_removed,came across this in stellaris today and it reminded me of this argument you were having with me from a month ago
space,not_removed,bit what about the radiation shielding and insulation you need around the camera space is a much bigger challenge than most people realise and even something that seems as simple as adding a camera can get incredibly complicated and expensive
space,not_removed,which are both results of a lowered budget you bet your ass more money would have ment a bigger more advanced craft whatever country youre in vote for those who favor helping the numerious space programs around the world were barely separated anymore the survival and knowledge of our species is something we all need to support in any way we can
space,not_removed,theyll definitely be collecting information until communications cuts out get our full moneys worth
space,not_removed,i mean it would look like a streak still in space before even hitting any clouds well above them
space,not_removed,its the furthest out a solar powered spacecraft has ever been sent thats actually pretty daring from an engineering perspective plus there will be some pretty good pictures theyre just not of any scientific value
space,not_removed,its hard to be daring when congress repeatedly cuts your budget in favor of useless porkbarrel spending
space,not_removed,do they have to quit to get out of office i just realized how foolish it is that i know nothing about how nasa administration is run
space,not_removed,hopefully he will be booted obama appointed him in and a scientist from jpl elachi will be appointed as far as i know nasa has never been run by science advocate almost all of them have been disastrous to science missions even griffin canceled planned programs such as the jupiter icy moons orbiter to launch in and included europa mission the terrestrial planet finder and the space interferometry mission in order to increase funding for manned missions none of which flew if we had some real leadership we have run a mars sample return mission by now in addition to a europa mission and the terrestrial planet finder instead we get the scraps while the iss gets a new space toilet
space,not_removed,id love to see if theres an answer to this i was pretty sure by age that my life goal was to lead the first manned mission to mars and to take a giant leap for womankind but somehow i thought id need to join the air force i was never in good shape so i opted for healthcare instead still i imagine at the rate technology and business is changing theres a chance i could get into orbit through some kind of commercial program im only
space,not_removed,save up money and buy a ride into space pretty sure that will be widely available within the next to years
space,not_removed,most astronaut jobs require some kind of engineering or science degree check the requirements for these positions on the nasa website spacex site or whatever space agency you have your eye on you can also check the requirements on linkedin that step alone may take a few years if you dont have the degree required but if you really want it then by god youll do it upon acquiring a degree you should probably work in your new field of expertise while you try to obtain an astronaut job which can probably take a while once you acquire an astronaut position you will train to be an astronaut in your specified field even though you are an astronaut you may trainwork for a decade before getting the opportunity to go to space so keep that in mind if you want this bad enough then you can make it happen stay in good physical condition at all times
space,not_removed,i think the time has passed when you need to specialize in something space related to get into space pick the career you will be the most successful at and become a success and save a lot of money a suborbital trip will cost about to dollars for the next ten years after that i expect prices to drop and orbital rides for tourists will become available about the same time in the future i would expect prices to drop further you have years that is a lot of time if you spend the next years in education or training and then save a year every year after that in an aggressive but balanced portfolio you will have
space,not_removed,spacex is hoping to sell tickets to mars for each so you could start increasing your income and saving money land on mars a roundtrip ticket — half a million dollars it can be done
space,not_removed,become an aerospace medicine physician couple that with a phd in engineering or in a biological or planetary science
space,not_removed,you can increase your chances but there is obviously no guaranteed path if you follow a path with the sole intent of getting into space you will almost surely be disappointed you need to be successful in a field which is useful and in that field you need to be happy ideally you find love and have a family children are wonderful but not necessary you need to be in the right place at the right time or make a bazillion dollars and buy your way on board all you need to do is buy low sell high
space,not_removed,im hoping for a moon base and reasonable travel expenses in my lifetime similar to yours im an optimist but it seems completely feasible
space,not_removed,stop smoking weed you need a job at spacex even the janitors there cant smoke weed get that job live frugally find yourself sailing toward mars in years
space,not_removed,i believe the current fast track is actually to be a deep sea welderconstruction
space,not_removed,id be fine with a oneway ticket
space,not_removed,i dont smoke weed but do they test for bath salts
space,not_removed,spacex does not test for weed they would have to fire too many of their engineers
space,not_removed,carl sagan smoked weed daily
space,not_removed,i was get over yourself thanks for trolling
space,not_removed,the ship needs to come back to earth anyway to pick up another set of passengers so it doesnt actually cost much for the trip back
space,not_removed,they are going to launch american astronauts for nasa they have government contracts they test
space,not_removed,i am corrected and browsing job openings
space,not_removed,not saying weed is bad for thinking about space just bad for space industry job retention for people who arent privileged or famous
space,not_removed,mats is a planet with a future earthnot so much
space,not_removed,i was kidding i know they test
space,not_removed,i watched the technical broadcast on youtube and they showed the barge then cut to black screen and didnt show the actual landing then they just showed it having already landed i was disappointed i didnt get to see that
space,not_removed,this must have been the first time you spectated then right no conspiracy theories here the footage is transmitted from the drone ship via satellite when the booster comes in it severely disrupts the signal something about ionizing the particles in the air when the ship is retrieved theyll release the full recording just as they did with the previous landings
space,not_removed,most of the worlds population is on the other side of the earth to your graphicin terms of population you are essentially catering to a niche audience flip the earth around and get ready to retire 😎
space,not_removed,shouldnt you be wearing a tin foil hat instead of a cap
space,not_removed,have you watched every spacex landing video yet
space,not_removed,i was wondering about this thanks it looks rather luminous in my city sky these nights
space,not_removed,seti alien extraterrestrial life search i have interned for seti before worked on some computer programming
space,not_removed,is there meant to be a link here nasa has ordered a whole bunch of crew flights to the iss its a contract thatll last a few years
space,not_removed,it looks so miserable i expected it be more more tightly inflated
space,not_removed,they probably didnt fully inflate it id imagine they partially inflate it wait to see if there are any leaks before inflating it fully to prevent a catastrophic blowout which could scatter debris and potentially damage the station
space,not_removed,given the fact that it has been packed for over a year and in the deep freeze of space for a month they were being very cautious stressing it they say if pressure holds stable the crew will enter the module next week to install more sensors
space,not_removed,no information on who this guy is the youtube hijacker did not copy over the description i feel like ive seen this video before
space,not_removed,i remember robert zubrin from a lecture he gave one year while i was in college he was advocating for the same thing back then compelling words then compelling words now
space,not_removed,he wants to search for extraterrestrial life he also wants to settle mars well sending humans to mars would contaminate the petri dish the search for life is an argument against sending humans to mars
space,not_removed,the only valid reason given was for the science and that doesnt require manned flights robots can probe for evidence of life more effectively than human beings who necessarily bring billions of microbes with them the notion that there will be civilizations on mars is a pipe dream well have symphony orchestras in antarctica before well have them on mars
space,not_removed,this is robert zubrin hes an engineer who has been advocating for a less expensivemore rapid mars mission campaign for decades he is really passionate about getting humans to another planet
space,not_removed,robert zubrin is a brilliant mind he could have gotten us to mars decades ago had we listened
space,not_removed,
space,not_removed,this video clip is from robert zubrins presentation of mars direct given at nasas ames facility just a few years ago
space,not_removed,thats the drzubrin s second point thats where the challenge is
space,not_removed,im not so sure i agree with your disagreement one way or another human civilization needs to figure out how to survive off this planet one day the earth will be uninhabitable for one of a myriad reasons be it overpopulation disease runaway greenhouse effect etc we will need to be able to develop the skills and technology to survive off this planet i am not saying that mars is the ultimate goal but working towards having colonies on other celestial bodies is a step in what i feel is a necessary direction to overcome our current ultimate fate also working towards understanding how to survive on a foreign world can only help us with our ability to survive on our current planet
space,not_removed,it is critical that humans settle mars to choose to remain only on earth is to choose extinction in time earth will become uninhabitable whether it is from a sudden cataclysm or gradual inevitable increase in the brightness of the sun life will not survive on earth forever to willingly permit our civilization to end and life as we know it to perish is not acceptable we cannot limit ourselves to earth and simply wait for our extinction we must choose to survive and this requires humans to leave earth there is no physical or technological reason why this is not possible our civilization has the resources and stability to begin this project now this may not always be the case therefore we should take this opportunity immediately by taking this first step to mars we are beginning a project which can guarantee our survival in perpetuity robots are useful but not sufficient to fulfill our scientific goals on mars dr steven squyres planetary geologist and lead scientist of the mars exploration rovers project has directed the use of rovers on mars for more than a decade he is grateful for what science he has been able to accomplish robotically but he insists that a human presence on mars is necessary to accomplish our scientific goals there
space,not_removed,dear god a voice of reason i love space exploration as much as anybody but the leap from a mars landing to an independent selfsustaining civilization is wider than getting there in the first place
space,not_removed,agreed theres really no reason to send people to mars other than for the achievement i often suspect that people hear a man talk passionately and become persuaded into thinking his argument must therefore be sound even if the content of his speech is actually flawed
space,not_removed,hes not too inspiring with the bad comb over thats why musk got the hair plugs
space,not_removed,thats where a challenge is id say there are more tempting challenges learning to live in the desert learning to live underground learning to live on the ocean floor learning to live in the clouds all of which are more hospitable environments than mars
space,not_removed,there is only one inevitable reason earth will become uninhabitable and its the life cycle of the sun that gives us a couple of billion years at least mars is already uninhabitable by any reasonable standard no breathable atmosphere no rain surface bathed in radiation frigid temperatures placing even a single egg in that basket is a suckers bet i say we continue to let our trusted robots do science economically for the foreseeable future a few centuries at least sure maybe even put a few boots on the martian ground when we can reasonably expect to bring them back to earth just so we can say we did not a oneway slow suicide mission even if we could pack it with trump supporters we should continue to develop methods of propulsion and if at some point nearlightspeed travel becomes feasible look for potentially habitable worlds around nearby stars mars and every other planet in our solar system is a deadend when it comes to planting a backup civilization any technology that could nudge mars toward habitability would be better applied to improving our own environment
space,not_removed,the universe itself will become uninhabitable some day unless we find some way to reverse entropy heat death is unavoidable as is our inevitable extinction we have a couple of billion years at least before the sun fries us considering the unimaginable strides technology has made since we began to use the scientific method i think we can afford to put civilizing mars on the back burner for a few thousand years while we focus on more immediate problems as for dr steven squyres opinion that a human presence is necessary to accomplish our scientific goals id be interested in reading his justification for that opinion if you have a link or two even if his reasons are sound human presence and independent civilization are two different things
space,not_removed,thank you were clearly in the minority here but its good to hear from someone else who supports exploring space but doesnt think that requires human explorers just yet
space,not_removed,zubrin doesnt actively advocate for setting up a self sustaining colony his entire point has been to approach the human mars mission properly such that it can readily be expanded and expanded to sustain more and more people as time goes on
space,not_removed,passion has no place in space
space,not_removed,learning to live in the desert is more a more tempting challenge then stepping on another planet and exploring it the possibility of discovering life elsewhere all the scientific advancements that would be require to achieve that goal
space,not_removed,do you seriously think were going to rely on robotic exploration of a planet months away for centuries edit at least defend your point instead of downvoting jeez
space,not_removed,learning to live in the desert is more a more tempting challenge then stepping on another planet and exploring it learning to live in the desert would certainly be more rewarding to more of humanity than stepping on another planet and exploring it whether you find life or not whether its different than earth life or not finding a superior technical civilization might have more impact but were not going to be doing that in this solar system of the scientific advances that would be required to achieve the goal of living on mars would also be required to achieve the goal of living in deserts and it would enable those bankrolling mars expeditions to see what kind of people have the temperament for living like desert rats before spending billions to blast them to another planet
space,not_removed,i havent downvoted anyone in this thread count the number of net downvotes my initial post has compared to the number of responses attacking my viewpoint before you point fingers i dont honestly expect were going to rely on robotic exploration of mars for centuries i do think human exploration needs to be justified and i havent heard the justification yet care to take a swing at it
space,not_removed,i wasnt pointing fingers at you specifically human exploration boils down to cost time and science efficiency long term robotic exploration will cost more as designing robots to do a job a human could remotely and semi autonomously is expensive as hell im including the manhours of designing each of their systems from scratch human explorers will also be able to do the same amount of science much faster and cover far more ground in the same amount of time humans are more adaptable too finally a robotic explorer is sent to do one job in one area only thats a few hundred million dollars if not more for one job a human has much better science output for the same cost happy to elaborate more when im off mobile
space,not_removed,long term robotic exploration will cost more as designing robots to do a job a human could remotely and semi autonomously is expensive as hell im including the manhours of designing each of their systems from scratch i disagree first of all we arent designing each of their systems from scratch at this point were building on designs that are already well above scratch second robots are less expensive than people because they dont require life support systems to function semiautonomously and they currently do their work with a oneway trip human explorers will also be able to do the same amount of science much faster and cover far more ground in the same amount of time humans are more adaptable too theres no rush to do the science faster mars isnt going anywhere and any life that may or may not have existed there isnt either we can send robots to do science for several years without a bathroom break the claim that humans are more adaptable doesnt really apply robots have already adapted to doing their job in the unoxygenated atmosphere bathed in radiation subzero temperatures for months or years on end they are well adapted for the job of doing science and if we require something they cant do we can send another robot that can finally a robotic explorer is sent to do one job in one area only thats a few hundred million dollars if not more for one job a human has much better science output for the same cost its going to cost more to send a human being to do the job and hell be doing less science because he needs to stay alive and get back home most of the science that came out of the moon landing was done here on earth as lunar samples were analyzed in terrestrial laboratories when we start returning samples from mars it makes much more sense to let robots collect them because the robot wont need to add its mass to the return flight we can actually collect more samples by robot because the robot can remain on mars much longer to do the collecting and because the robot can load its samples into the return vehicle and stay behind and all thats without factoring in the inevitable loss of human life that will result from attempting the job with people just as a simple dollarsandcents calculation robots make more sense
space,not_removed,focusing on your first point because i havent got time to write up a reply right now first of all we arent designing each of their systems from scratch at this point were building on designs that are already well above scratch second robots are less expensive than people because they dont require life support systems to function semiautonomously and they currently do their work with a oneway trip as someone who works on equipment like this youre wrong literally all of it is built from scratch theres some heritage on the system architectures we use but nothing is reused because technology is always improving so systems are redesigned to improve performance developing autonomy is always more expensive than eclss imo you have to weigh the development time and expenses against the more up front costs of the manned mission equipment
space,not_removed,globalsmog is one of the best and reliable supplier of oxygen sensor oxygen sensor maha belt and many more we supply a wide range of superior quality hydraulic accessories by spx esp sun including hoses gauges fittings and valves
space,not_removed,potentionally could we claim according to this hypothesis that stars are just highly concentrated energy holograms attracting particles in the vast space
space,not_removed,if the universe is a hologram would we not be able to travel in it
space,not_removed,well you can still walk out of the theater after watching a movieat least you think you are walking
space,not_removed,if you want any close up pics of a patch reply here and ill take that pic and upload it for you
space,not_removed,when i was in second grade i was doing a report on space travel so i sent a letter asking nasa what would be the best resources to use for my report they sent me back an entire box full of every manned space flight patch and sticker up to that point as well as huge manilla envelopes full of glossy photos taken from the apollo missions of course stupid me lost almost every piece of that because i just thought thats what happened when you sent a letter to nasa little did i know that sort of thing would never happen today and also little did nasa know that a small act of kindness like that would make a dopey kid from iowa insanely happy and a fan of space travel forever
space,not_removed,where the one that harry stamper ripped off and gave to aj frost to send back home
space,not_removed,if its specifically indicating that these are human patches does that mean there are a series of patches for all the animals that have been in space
space,not_removed,to add to this many of these patches came from alumni who had major parts in the mission
space,not_removed,the most recent one shown is from is that an older picture or is it just not updated yet
space,not_removed,this looks super familiar is this from the engineering building at saint louis university
space,not_removed,you can buy these as a set in the gift shop at the kennedy space center in florida its pretty expensive though
space,not_removed,all american manned missions there are easily a hundred russian missions your school hasnt included many of which have carried american astronauts that being said it is an awesome display i imagine it took ages to make
space,not_removed,are you sure you go to a school thats one of the cleanest and neatest looking display of anything ive seen a school put up
space,not_removed,april i have that patch too it was given to me by steve nagel who was on that flight and two others that he captained his wife was also an astronaut and i think accompanied him on at least one flight they were both professors at my local university and i got to job shadow them my freshman year in high school it was spectacular unfortunately his wife passed away a year or two ago the job shadowing was incredible and i learned a lot i still keep in touch with steve
space,not_removed,that one patch that fell off is really triggering me to the point of physical discomfort
space,not_removed,you can buy these for about a patch at johnson space center in houston the autographs are a little harder to track down
space,not_removed,strange i cant see the afghanistan space flight patch from wwwimgurcomgalleryjujlc anywhere is there a picture missing from the album op
space,not_removed,my alma mater i spent some very long hours in that building if i remember correctly this display used to also contain a space shuttle tile but it was stolen a few years back im not sure if they ever tracked it down
space,not_removed,second time seeing slu on reddit last time was the chinese students galaxy print maserati parked in front of the village
space,not_removed,my school has the first second and the third positions in the best school in my city
space,not_removed,i take it no sovietrussian missions count as human kidding i understand that their patches arent widely sold but they did exist
space,not_removed,how come the moon landing doesnt get the same beware of naysayers autoessay that the holocaust does
space,not_removed,nice that you included the word human but you really should have also included united states
space,not_removed,how do people get these thought they were from crewstaff only
space,not_removed,woo slu went there for college they used to have massive pictures of notable alums that worked on the apollo missions too my favorite picture was of gene kranz edit the reason why there are all those patches is because there was an alum that has worked on each mission their signature is there too
space,not_removed,st louis university
space,not_removed,would it be too much to ask for a close up on all of them thanks
space,not_removed,and also little did nasa know that a small act of kindness like that would make a dopey kid from iowa insanely happy and a fan of space travel forever nah they knew exactly what they were doing
space,not_removed,that was given to gimpy aka dan truman when aj got back
space,not_removed,probably id imagine major unmanned missions like hubble probably get one too
space,not_removed,doubt it since this looks to be only american patches
space,not_removed,those are just american patches the space shuttle program ended in and weve been riding with the russians ever since
space,not_removed,i was thinking it had to be someplace in ohio a large portion of our astronauts come from ohio
space,not_removed,the space and rocket center in huntsville also has them and they are a bit cheaper there
space,not_removed,if i am correct this is from saint louis university its one of the nicest buildings on campus
space,not_removed,there are no soviet patches in that display
space,not_removed,it also doesnt have any other patches than american ones
space,not_removed,they are available for sale at basically any space themed museum visitor center or website at kennedy there are huge racks of them its harder to find more obscure patches like the awesome nro spy mission patches but even then people just have them made and sell them on ebay
space,not_removed,you can buy them from the same manufacturer nasa does httpswwwabemblemcommakesnasapatches
space,not_removed,httpwwwpopularpatchcom has most of the ones i know about
space,not_removed,you can buy them at the kennedy space center
space,not_removed,they do there are patches for all the robot probe missions too we humans like our flair
space,not_removed,even classified mission have patches creepy ones too httpvigilantcitizencomlatestnewsnewusspysatellitelogooctopusengulfingworldwordsnothingbeyondreachunderneath
space,not_removed,pretty much every mission has its own patches just look for all the spacexula patches and coins
space,not_removed,yeah i know it ended after but i dont see the patches from the last shuttle missions from
space,not_removed,my guess is the john glenn school of public affairs at osu
space,not_removed,any idea on the price
space,not_removed,this school doesnt consider other people than americans being humans what about the french interkosmos patch where is that
space,not_removed,the harder part is getting the crews autographs
space,not_removed,yep i got all the apollos for
space,not_removed,i guess they never got any of the new ones someone stated earlier that most of these patches came from alumni of the school that were involved in the flight so maybe no one have them the newer ones but im just speculating
space,not_removed,ironically russian space officials also left door open for other nations to join the project an idea that so far has had a mixed reception at nasa and esa looks more like posturing or a bargaining strategy also is years away a lot can change politicallyeconomicallyeven technologically by then
space,not_removed,oh thats cool i got to go to my calendar now so how many space stations can we get from here to mars can we make a space station chain
space,not_removed,havent they threatened to take some of the core module from iss but those modules while built by russia and originally designed in the soviet era are actually not russian property anymore
space,not_removed,you have to remember things in the solar system constantly orbit the sun you cant build a bridge or stepping stones between planets because they dont orbit at the same radial velocity
space,not_removed,zaraya is owned by nasa and zvezda service module is likely too old to move safely
space,not_removed,no zarya is us property but they have never suggested breaking off any of the current modules they wouldnt be useful for russias future plans theyre nearing the ends of their design lives have incompatible docking hardware with whats planned for the future modules and spacecraft and theyre technologically obsolete if russia ever separates any modules from iss for independent use it will only be the possibly modules planned for launch in the next few years
space,not_removed,but dont we have spots in space where stuff doesnt move
space,not_removed,woosh or no woosh i cant tell guys help me out here
space,not_removed,there are relatively stable points called lagrange points such as the earthsun point where nasa has proposed to put a space station that would support exploration of the solar system but those points are specific to parentchild sunplanet planetmoon etc pairs theres not like a series of them between earth and mars
space,not_removed,this is rspace assume everyone has no idea whats going on until proven otherwise
space,not_removed,you can watch this in full context with photography here
space,not_removed,sce to aux was setting the power bus to run on a lower voltage there were a lot of good comments and links at this right here on rspace to save you one step of clicks here is the with more amazing details
space,not_removed,this has to be a great example of how much spaceflight changed i cant imagine that today anyone would not activate the launch escape system upon the loss of complete telemetry from inside the vehicle id be so curious on how safe the engineers in charge actually considered saturn v
space,not_removed,mr aaron was a steely eyed missile man quick thinking on his part saved the mission
space,not_removed,i watched this ep of from the earth to the moon only a few hours ago
space,not_removed,does anyone know what sce to aux was was there two power grids or
space,not_removed,didnt they make that function automatic in future designs because of this mission for example when you go on battery power the power bus will switch to low voltage input automatically to conserve the batteries thats what was required to prevent this from happening after all
space,not_removed,sce to aux tells all about it and explains what it means
space,not_removed,he realized that the team handling systems that night had briefly dropped the capsules voltage by accident this voltage change he discovered had effected a device called the sce or signal conditioning equipment which was responsible for converting raw signals from the crafts sensors to standard voltages so that information could be displayed on instruments and relayed back to houston by switching the sce to auxiliary or backup power mode—aux—aaron remembered that the sce would continue to operate under lowervoltage conditions and the instruments would come back at that point the fuel cells could be restarted in a matter of seconds the solution came to him for those people whore lazy basically the lightning disconnected the power supply and the batteries did not provide sufficient voltage this caused the instruments to screw up untill they were switched to low power mode
space,not_removed,why dont the sensors always operate at low power mode are they more accurate with a higher applied voltage
space,not_removed,pretty sure pslv is already the current record holder for successfully deploying the most number of satellites from a single launch if you include nano satellites and cube sats then both roscosmos and nasa have launched more than in a single launch this however should take the record in all categories if successful
space,not_removed,could land it in the record books success or failure i would say this is in no matter what if it goes off the most launched if it goes down in flames the largest failure both will surely be records either way too many eggs in one basket makes little room for error lest you disappoint individuals teams and their projects if it doesnt work
space,not_removed,theyll be outcompeted price and volumewise if those were the only two considerations then yes but having a dedicated launcher means it will launch on your schedule only not anyone elses plus they can choose the exact orbital parameters they want their satellites in they dont have to compromise or compensate by choosing a big launch to tag on with
space,not_removed,from wikipedia although venuss cloud cover is nearly featureless in visible light it was discovered that extensive cloud detail could be seen through mariners ultraviolet camera filters earthbased ultraviolet observation had shown some indistinct blotching even before mariner but the detail seen by mariner was a surprise to most researchers
space,not_removed,sounds like sirius its set for somewhere in slovenia youll need to specify the time of your observation is it sirius i usually find any time someone asks about a surprisingly bright multicolored twinkling star near orions belt its sirius sirius is very bright because of that and with a turbulent atmosphere it can appear to twinkle quite a lot and in multiple colors
space,not_removed,httpwwwskymaporg might help you out i just searched orions belt and there are a few stars to the left as well as a nebula the sparkling of the object is due to atmospheric disturbances and varying densities that the light is passing through probably just particular conditions there that made it stand out more
space,not_removed,get the google sky map app for your smart phone run apppoint at sky
space,not_removed,do this you can even spot the hubble and iss by using this app its really neat
space,not_removed,im sorry dave im afraid i can do that is by now too well imprinted into our cultural code there will be severe problems on the human end similarly to the considerable political problems in developing autonomous armed drones
space,not_removed,that will certainly be so but i think that the combined problem solving skills of humans and computers is probably the best way to proceed especially with the limits imposed by space travel that aside and even if the technology is never approved for military applications the advances they made in computer situational awareness and response at such a low computational cost will certainly be useful in other fields i could see definite use in autonomous vehicles as well as many other robotics projects in decision making skills
space,not_removed,these guys are livin it up in the sky and im stuck down here staring at all my work pondering my existence
space,not_removed,interesting a better explanation of how the resonances in the observed orbits of all the farthest kuiper belt objects seem to indicate tgevexstence of planet i was curious how far au is one au is the radius of earths orbit i used miles which is about light minutes times that is about light hours light days or light year or about the distance to alpha centauri
space,not_removed,love the enterprise in this shot confirms the world governments have been keeping things from us for decades
space,not_removed,nuclear holocaust aside that damn impressive for a society of sentient apes precision ballistics as destructive as it is impressive
space,not_removed,why the need for the point harnesses though the only thing i can think of is if their bunker is the target of an incoming nuke they wont be tossed out of their seats due to an explosion until they can accomplish their launch tasks
space,not_removed,one thing a lot of people dont think about is that the world built thousands of launch vehicles and spacecraft during the century at the cost of trillions of dollars the vast majority of which were never put to use thankfully because their purpose was the delivery of nuclear weapons but it gives you a sense of what we as a species is capable of in regards to space and helps put into perspective the modern rise of new space when aerospace resources and engineers arent all tied up with the cold war balance of terror theres much they can achieve
space,not_removed,i know some people who are on the reentry vehicle team one guy just had his anniversary with the company oo been working on this since the atlas days
space,not_removed,thats pretty much it the launch capsule in which they sit is designed to survive anything but an absolute direct hit and when you consider that the missiles are in the ground within miles of this facility and they too would be target for ground burst nuclear detonations the launch crew would be in for a very rough ride the accuracy of these weapons is measure in something called cep circular error probability ours can reportedly fly kilometers and land within meters of their intended target the soviet built weapons are thought to have roughly the same level of accuracy
space,not_removed,theres a lot of good lessons to be learned from the military side of rockets more stringent structural and guidance requirements leads to better redundancy and safety for commercial and civil space use
space,not_removed,its a good thought but it doesnt address the additional gravitational lensing caused by dark matter
space,not_removed,no ignoring the fact that galaxies dont expand with the hubble flow because they are gravitationally bound hubbles law is isotropic the same in all directions therefore it is not affecting rotation if maximum red shift is used to measure the velocities of stars in distant galaxies then the direction of those stars will be miscalculated in proportion to the ratio of binding velocity componentorbital velocity component because that measured red shift is the hypotenuse of two vector components you cannot use maximum redshift because youre measuring spectral lines you dont know exactly where the line ends and the continuum begins and no the expansion will not have any affect on the rotation curve you can separate the expanding and rotation components as they are independent an expanding shell does not rotate or appear to and as says there is independent evidence to explain
space,not_removed,yes heres a httpdarksitefindercommapsworldhtml the best place ive ever seen the milky way was in the big bend but ive also seen it in rural parts of texas not too far from abilene what youre seeing is stars billions of stars so far away you cant see individual points of light the stars we can see are all closer than light years
space,not_removed,you actually dont have to go to a dark site to see them just somewhere away from the city lights is enough to catch a slight glimpse i live miles south of houston there is still plenty of light pollution from the nearby chemical plants but on a nice clear night you can see clouds and nebula out of the side of your eye but if you attempt to look directly at it you wont be able to see them sometimes on those nights ill just focus on a single point in the sky and do the best i can to not look directly at the amazing sights that come into focus out if the corners of my eye
space,not_removed,yes you can you need a dark site use google to help you find one
space,not_removed,its possible you would have to get away from the city to really dark locations you get a side view if our galaxy stars interstellar dust
space,not_removed,in the southern hemisphere it is impossible to miss the milky way it dominates the night sky in the north it is fainter so you need a dark location but if you get outside of a city it is easily visible
space,not_removed,absolutely infact it was so bright and obvious i swore profusely at length the first time i got out of my car in death valley late at night
space,not_removed,you sure can miles away from pretty much any town or city if you can find a place out in the middle of nowhere and away from civilization you can see it clear as day the white band across the sky the milky way is actually from all the star light coming from the center of our galaxy the darker clouds you see in the white band is space dust
space,not_removed,yep come to new zealand bit cloudy tonight but can see them generally most nights except around the full moon
space,not_removed,this is quite interesting to me im currently in east africa and the night sky is so beautiful and clear i wouldnt really know what to look for though any tips
space,not_removed,dark skies and a new moon or moon below the horizon summertime is better everyone should look at it once in their life im able to see it clearly between athens and augusta ga so you dont need to be in the middle of nowhere an hours drive into country is probably enough
space,not_removed,yes you certainly can i have seen them for myself while in the sahara desert – they were perfectly clear the sight is beautiful and well worth traveling for unfortunately as i live in london there are too many city lights at night to see very much at all how do you think ancient writers who did not have telescopes could write so poetically about something if they werent able to see it
space,not_removed,well the uk is fucked there is the northeast coast of scotland and i might drive up there sometime if i get chance
space,not_removed,go to backcountry south america and its easy youll wonder about your brothers sanity its easily the dominant feature aside from the moon as a bonus you can easily see the magellanic clouds too on a really dark night if you know where to look you can see the andromeda galaxy too although only just
space,not_removed,definitely i saw it while out at sea sailing on it was one of those moments wooden ship at sail in pitch dark looking up at the stars and the milky way indescribable
space,not_removed,yes you need a dark place it might not look like the pictures though
space,not_removed,yes i grew up in rural oklahoma and i use to walk to the center of a field and sit on top of a cattle feeder as i have traveled the world i still have never seen the night sky look the way it use to from that field whenever i go home i like to walk or drive out to a secluded spot and look up at the sky at night so i can see it
space,not_removed,you definitely can when i go camping in northern az the long band across the sky is easily visible
space,not_removed,does anyone know where the best spot near san diego to see possible clouds might be
space,not_removed,i live in a rural area which according to that map is right on the edge of a blue and light grey spot i can clearly see the milky way and we were actually just looking at it and talking about it last night while drinking in my backyard shortly after watching the iss pass by one of the many advantages of living in the country
space,not_removed,how to i interpret this ive got a blue spot somewhere actually decently near me but not a dark gray anywhere close
space,not_removed,why is it more visible from the southern hemisphere
space,not_removed,look up it is kind of the biggest thing in the sky look for a huge band of light stretching across the heavens in a southeastnorthwest direction
space,not_removed,download stellarium and point it towards your area and then change the time youll have all sorts of things to look at even an android app that you can use to point in the general direction to get an idea of what youre seeing
space,not_removed,from oregon us same here idk about the andromeda galaxy though ill have to look it up
space,not_removed,blue you should be able to see quite a bit every where around me is yelloworange at best and you can see a lot
space,not_removed,its not quite that its more visible but its more visible for more of the year the brightest part of the milky way is the region surrounding the core even though we cant see the core itself this part of the milky way is only visible during summer in the northern hemisphere where the nights are short it also doesnt rise very far above the horizon depending on how far north you are in the southern hemisphere you get the brightest part of the milky way during long winter nights and high overhead the winter milky way for the northern hemisphere is looking out toward the edge of the galaxy and is much dimmer than the summer milky way but it does get high in the sky which can help
space,not_removed,when conditions are good i can easily see why ancient civilizations believed the sky was solid the stars provide the optical illusion of a solid surface
space,not_removed,awesome thanks luckily its remarkably close to where ive been going but every time ive gone its either been cloudy or the moon has been super bright and made its really hard to see much of anything
space,not_removed,im willing to bet money that one of the passengers is either james cameron or richard garriott
space,not_removed,as eager as i am for this to happen going to the moon in under years on a rocket that doesnt yet exist is i think a bit presumptuous and by bit presumptuous i mean little ridiculous then again these timeline claims are typical for musk all the same best wishes to musk spacex and the crew and as treebeard would say dont be hasty
space,not_removed,hopefully these two individuals have really patient lawyers on retainer to read the mile long waiver they will be signing
space,not_removed,i think the waver will be rather short just the insurance company header two whom it may apply the undersigned the ¯ツ¯ emoji and then a few names
space,not_removed,wish i knew this was happening sooner i would have applied thanks for sharing your experience though
space,not_removed,id be interested to know more about the million pounds of cement and how to get the rocket to stay stationary the whole time
space,not_removed,we are so unevolved when it comes to humandesigned propulsion systems its amazing
space,not_removed,yeah i wish i could have gotten morebetter pictures of the slides some of the buildings had some awesome ones the techs who had used them in the past did not view them as fun fuddy duddies
space,not_removed,youve got anything better that works just as well im sure everyone would love to find that
space,not_removed,over the course of billion years and a couple of dozen circuits around the milky way the stars in the stellar nursery where the sun formed have loooong since dispersed all over the galaxy that being said there are astronomers who have been searching for some of the suns siblings by looking for stars with a similar mix of heavy elements as the suns indicating that they were born in the same place as the sun a similar evolutionary state indicating they are about the same age as the sun with a relatively low velocity relative to the sun indicating they have been near each other for a long time none have been found yet but esas gaia mission which is currently mapping the positions distances and motions of billions of stars might help reveal some new candidates
space,not_removed,thank you very much that answered my question perfectly ill be looking into gaia now
space,not_removed,awesome gifs thank you i was mostly ignorant of the mission details until now saving the anticipation until the last minute when i saw the gif i thought one pass thats dumb but then i saw the next gif so many passes looks like a fantastically planned mission well done nasa
space,not_removed,when it crashes into jupiter are they planning on collecting any data inside the atmosphere or is it just done i know its probably unlikely that there will be much data but just in case
space,not_removed,so just so i have this straight after its done its job were going to crash juno into jupiter doesnt this really piss off the reclusive native species who inhabit the various elemental planes of the planet
space,not_removed,ooooo the spacecraft also carries three lego figurines representing galileo the roman god jupiter and his wife juno in roman mythology jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief frommount olympus juno was able to look into the clouds and reveal her husbands real nature juno holds a magnifying glass as a sign for searching for the truth and her husband holds a lightning bolt the third lego crew member galileo galilei has his telescope with him on the journey although most lego toys are made of plastic lego made these figures of aluminum to endure the extreme conditions of space flight
space,not_removed,the last one shows that nasa is using earth in a whip technique originally discovered in roller derby
space,not_removed,this shit blows my mind how can some humans be so intelligent and so damn organized to accomplish such amazing feats and other humans be so god damned stupid
space,not_removed,i always get lost and confused trying to navigate programs like this thanks for making these
space,not_removed,that gravity slingshot in the last gif is the best representation of a gravity assist ive ever seen incredible how it works
space,not_removed,acronyms initialisms abbreviations contractions and other phrases which expand to something larger that ive seen in this thread fewer lettersmore letters used in this commentjovian orbital insertion maneuver used in this commentkerbal space program the rocketry simulator im a bot and i first saw this thread at jun utc httpwwwdecronymxyz httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetoorangeredstiltonsubjectheyyouracronymbotsucks
space,not_removed,so whats the url to watch juno stream live its arrival in jupiter orbit anyone got the link ill throw some coin yer way
space,not_removed,mission planners will purposefully have juno dive into jupiter on mission end instead of keeping it in orbit and losing control potentially risking juno crashing on a moon and contaminating it why is nasa concerned about contaminating jupiters moons but not jupiter itself
space,not_removed,this is great awesome visualizations what is the purpose of junos spin and why will it spin faster during its insertion and then slow its spin down again after something to do with the sensors collection data i assume
space,not_removed,total noob question here does keeping such a wide orbit allow it to get closer on each pass it looks like its getting to around mi off the surface could it maintain an orbit at that distance given the speed at which it will be arriving obviously i have no mathematical concept of orbital dynamics hence the question
space,not_removed,on the gravity assist from earth amateur radio operators all over the world ramateurradio
space,not_removed,wow thats impressive thank you for taking the time to put that together for those of us who couldnt see it on nasas page
space,not_removed,this video sums it up pretty well also
space,not_removed,dont forget to visit rjunomission if you like this sort of thing
space,not_removed,confused tan gazzelle practical obediant african mole snake im crying
space,not_removed,who do i talk to about transferring my taxes that go to pay congress over to nasa
space,not_removed,so to get this straight on june is juno crashing into jupiter or simply making another orbit around the planet
space,not_removed,when i first read the mission plan it said it would use a series of complex manuvers to insure it was captured by jupiter and entered a stable orbit but that doesnt look complex i do it all the time thank you ksp
space,not_removed,if im not mistaken its max velocity will be reached each close pass what is the maximum orbital velocity of jupiter for this mission note im not a physics major please pardon my lack of proper vocabulary asking this question
space,not_removed,do you know if theres a mobile app for the spacecraft similar to the one set up for new horizons last year
space,not_removed,someone should make a gif of juno casting a shadow over the landscape and invading like independence day
space,not_removed,where can we find the browser version of these videos ive searched the nasa juno mission webpage and didnt have much luck
space,not_removed,just an fyi to folks using various browsers and bandwidth not a single gif to be found in any of these hyperlinks they are all webm files
space,not_removed,in the second gif why does the velocity in relation to earth not drop as fast as the one in relation to jupiter is it because of the insertion burn edit also what is the purpose of the mission is juno just gathering data on jupiter or some of its moons as well
space,not_removed,how long does it take to complete one orbit post joi and does nasa plan on sciencing during the furthest stretches of the orbit or do they powerdown the satellite
space,not_removed,so did they plan juno to land on jupiter on july when they launched it
space,not_removed,the last gif just blows my mind of what it must take to correctly map the trajectory before launch just the sheer distance and margin of error
space,not_removed,that gif of the orbits juno will take was incredible you physics nerds are the best
space,not_removed,thank you so much for these since i cant install the nasa eyes software
space,not_removed,i dont understand why risk of contamination is such a large issue the probe is tiny compared to any of the moons can anyone explain
space,not_removed,quick question cause i have a terrible memory so dont remember things is this the one where we crash it into the planet and some people pretty unrealistically think that the nuclear reactor powering it was cause something crazy to happen inside of the planet or did that happen in the and this is just routine because i just remembered reading something about how the planet could implode and no matter how unrealistic that may be it would be the most power asserting america thing ever that we blew up a planet
space,not_removed,just questions why so much radiation in jupiters orbit and why is the probe rotating at all or shoul i say does it need to have a rotation
space,not_removed,this seems fucking lame as hell youre telling me this all boils down to a day mission fucking hell man will we at least have some good ideas as to whats going on on jupiters surface afterwards
space,not_removed,could anyone simply tell me what juno is doing that galileo didnt and how come we didnt build a europa lander instead
space,not_removed,whats the junocams resolution and can the spacecraft send burst of data before it burns up in atmosphere
space,not_removed,i love space stuff so mind blowing how fast that thing is traveling yet its slow af for space
space,not_removed,if they change the attitude of the craft do the stop the spin also what is the spins purpose thanks
space,not_removed,anyone else find it both disconcerting and fascinating on how close the spacecraft will be to jupiter on the perijove portions of its orbit it looks like it wouldnt take a large mistake for it to suddenly become enveloped by the goliath that is jupiter
space,not_removed,god astrophysics is so mind boggling i can not imagine the math that went into this mission let alone any space mission i know theres a lot of guys working on it and computersbut it just boggles me that were able to send stuff out with the precision that we have
space,not_removed,ive been meaning to get back into kerbal space program this clinched it
space,not_removed,quick question will information still be transmitted as juno actually descends into jupiter it would be fascinating to get more information from the actual atmosphere itself i understand of course it wont make it too far before the pressure utterly obliterates it but any more insight would be absolutely amazing
space,not_removed,thats pretty awesome one question whats with all the strange gif names
space,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment here is the nasa planetary science director dr james green talking about the mission this past friday if you want a little more of the mission details here is some perspective to add onto what heywire is talking about this is an asteroid that hit jupiter and created an explosion about the size of the earth juno spacecraft probably wouldnt even be half a pixel in that video here its live there shoud be some pictures coming shortly yea i know what youre getting at though it boils down to some basic orbital maneuvers on the note about mapping the orbit is cleverly designed to get very good complete coverage in jupiters fixed frame on the gravity assist from earth amateur radio operators all over the world sent juno a morse code message that was picked up by junos instruments ramateurradio im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
space,not_removed,it looks to get about miles away from jupiter to get caught by the gravity thats pretty close right
space,not_removed,so what if they decide they can risk a burn and try and save the orbit do you think they would
space,not_removed,the last one is sick its like it used a gravity assist to throw itself into jupiters orbit
space,not_removed,i always wondered why they always have the satellites crash into something at the end of the mission why dont they just let it float on are they afraid of leaving bread crumbs back to earth
space,not_removed,somedayway in the distant future when astronauts wouldve landed on jupiter and come across the juno crash site a space janitor is gonna take a good long look at the wreck and say damn im not cleaning that up
space,not_removed,instead of crashing it why cant we land it on jupiter could still use it for images and things then
space,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomblissfuleasybats basically on jupiter what if this pisses off the aliens
space,not_removed,look more cgi nasa is a complete fraud and it is really refreshing to see how many people are starting to wake up to that just go to their official instagram and read the comments
space,not_removed,you do realize nasa is controlled directly by satan they are lying to us all they want us to believe the world is a giant ball even though the floor in my padded cell is flat come on sheeple for gawds sake the world is flat
space,not_removed,talking about the mission this past friday if you want a little more of the mission details
space,not_removed,after the first few i said cool whatevercomment reading time and saw yours and clicked the next one very cool indeed glad you said something
space,not_removed,if the animation is accurate i wouldnt expect the spacecraft to last very long on that trajectory juno will smash into jupiter rather than slowly skim the atmosphere junos velocity relative to jupiter is mph miles per second at that point none of the instruments onboard seem useful for gathering data during the descent besides the camera which will be likely rendered inoperable by the intense radiation halfway through the mission even if it were to snap some photos it wouldnt have the time to send them back i cant find a reference to the bandwidth available to the probe but it would likely be less than kilobits per second it will be one super sweet blaze of glory though
space,not_removed,i had heard on a public radio program about juno that when it is close to jupiter the radiation is so strong it cant communicate and it gets damaged thats why the orbit takes it closer and then further away collect when close transmit when further away i assume this means that they wont be able to collect and transmit as it crashes into jupiter
space,not_removed,its been done actually httpsenwikipediaorgwikigalileospacecraft this probe however doesnt have a heat shield to survive the heat or aero forces
space,not_removed,unlikely i mean the atmosphere thickens very gradually as you approach the surface of a planet so in a way yes there will be time to get some information back but communications require a direct line of sight from the antenna to earth and juno will begin to tumble as soon as the atmosphere gets relatively thick
space,not_removed,im sure theyll be happy to have some scrap metal especially considering httpsenwikipediaorgwikijupitercomposition
space,not_removed,well its how we got the transistor its their turn to get it now
space,not_removed,if they minded jupiter would have been turned into lucifer by now and theyd be telling us to lay off europa
space,not_removed,either that or we break the httpsenwikipediaorgwikimatrioshkabrain
space,not_removed,this is being done so that juno doesnt run the risk of colliding with one of jupiters moons thereby contaminating it i just learned this today and figured id pass it along
space,not_removed,cassini has a similar fate in saturn so i guess well see if the saturnians consider it an act of aggression
space,not_removed,haha i didnt know about the lego figures some aliens are gonna intercept the juno and be surprised when they get to earth and humans can bend their knees and elbows
space,not_removed,here is a of the figurines pretty cool
space,not_removed,that is cool i wonder if we can buy some replica titanium legos of these somewhere
space,not_removed,its called gravity assist its based on the same principle as a whip transferring kinetic energy from one body to another some spacecraft use multiple gravity assists to reach their destination examples voyager rosetta
space,not_removed,if you look closely juno also uses a gravity assist to slow down at jupiter saving energy on orbital insertion notice that for the earth gravity assist juno approaches the earth from behind the basic intuition is that the earths gravity pulls juno forward causing juno to gain momentum and the earth to lose momentum just like your roller derby example the earth is so massive that the effect on its orbit is infinitesimally small but juno gets a big boost now look at where juno is relative to jupiter when they get close youll see that the roles are reversed jupiter is approaching juno from behind this time juno is dragging jupiter along giving jupiter a tiny tiny tiny gravity assist the rules are the same here jupiter doesnt notice the extra momentum but juno slows down considerably source hundreds of hours of kerbal space program
space,not_removed,almighty bell curve
space,not_removed,the bandwidth of human potential is defined by circumstance and effort no effort no result
space,not_removed,not sure if this is what you are looking for but this takes you to a list of various links on nasas website including the eyes on juno program which says it lets you watch the arrival on july httpssolarsystemnasagovplanetsjupiterjunotoolkit
space,not_removed,here its live there shoud be some pictures coming shortly
space,not_removed,there will be no scientific instruments on while is gets into orbit all the energy and focus is on the engine and that burn needed to get it into the first orbit the first orbit will last days when the craft starts approaching to start it second orbit is when we can expect pretty pictures that wont be until august some time i suppose the only thing you will see live is the joy of the scientists if it successfully gets into orbit they will not know for sure until around pm pacific time on the the initial burn is supposed to start at like pm pacific time the burn takes minutes and the data takes to get back to earth
space,not_removed,dont expect too much anytime soon
space,not_removed,some of europas moon have potential habitability httpsenwikipediaorgwikieuropamoonpotentialhabitability httpsenwikipediaorgwikicallistomoonpotentialhabitability basically any possibility of liquid water is the possibility of an environment that can harbor bacteria or viral life the concerns are mostly twofold first if there is life already on these moons then we dont want to accidentally wipe it out through the introduction of some life that hitched a ride on juno second if we send a mission to one of these moons in the future looking for life we want to be sure were detecting life from the moon and not life from earth that got there some other way you can read some more about it here httpsenwikipediaorgwikiplanetaryprotection
space,not_removed,jupiter is not considered a potentially habitable environment whereas the oceans under the surface of europa could be crashing into europa would be bad whereas the spacecraft will be incinerated travelling more than times faster than the space station in orbit around the earth itll be vaporized
space,not_removed,according to our current understanding there is a much lower likelihood of life on jupiter itself than on some of its moons moreover even if there were life on jupiter the most surefire way of sterilizing a probe would be to expose it to conditions sufficient to vaporize it in its entirety which will happen during entry additionally in terms of radiation exposure from the probes small amount of radioactive material in its rtgs jupiter already experiences a tremendous amount of radiation
space,not_removed,the spin has to do with stabilization of the spacecraft the angular momentum keeps the spacecraft more stable similar to a bicycle being more stable when the wheels are spinning heres a quote from the httpwwwjplnasagovnewspresskitsjunolaunchpdf why a rotating spacecraft for juno like nasas earlier pioneer spacecraft spinning makes the spacecrafts pointing extremely stable and easy to control just after launch and before its solar arrays are deployed juno will be spunup by rocket motors on its stillattached secondstage rocket booster junos planned spin rate varies during the mission rpm for cruise rpm for science operations and rpm for main engine maneuvers to simplify and decrease weight all instruments are fixed while in orbit at jupiter the spinning spacecraft will sweep the fields of view of its instruments through space once for each rotation at two rotations per minute the instruments fields of view sweep across jupiter about times in the two hours it takes juno to fly from pole to pole it spins faster during insertion for additional stability during the engine burn
space,not_removed,the wide orbit doesnt necessarily mean it can get closer each pass the orbit is designed specifically to avoid the radiation donut around jupiter see achieving a tight circular orbit thats always miles off the surface probably would require too much fuel which would make the spacecraft more expensive and more difficult to design
space,not_removed,on july juno will be entering an orbit around jupiter right now juno is still in transit on july it will be performing an engine burn to slow down so that it gets captured by jupiter and enters a jupiter orbit if the engine burn isnt performed then juno likely is moving to fast to be captured by jupiter and gets flung out of jupiters system and back into interplanetary space the crash into jupiter is expected to occur in february
space,not_removed,it will make orbits total before it enters into and burns up in jupiters atmosphere
space,not_removed,yea ataglance the maneuvers are pretty straightforward deep space burn at aphelion for fuel conservation gravity assist from earth out perijove burn for orbit capture another perijove burn for period reduction into science orbit theres definitely complexity in the design though for example the insertion into a capture orbit and then later period reduction into science orbit is a fuel saving measure
space,not_removed,judging by the gifs and assuming no significant changes are made to the orbit after insertion it looks to be nearly mph and yes you are correct it will reach its fastest speed on each close pass due to jupiters gravity pulling it roughly in the same direction it is traveling at junos closest point to jupiter it begins travelling away and begins to slow down until it reaches its slowest speed at the highest part of the orbit
space,not_removed,max speed in the orbit is always at the perijove the point in the orbit closest to jupiter due to orbital mechanics looks like on jupiter orbit insertion joi the max speed relative to jupiter will exceed mph
space,not_removed,not sure i follow i recorded these videos on my computer by running the eyes on juno program which you can find here httpseyesnasagoveyesonjunohtml
space,not_removed,the spacecraft spins for stability and for a critical mission segment like a main engine burn they basically spin up i believe to rpm for added stability and spin back down to the nominal spacecraft spin rate i believe rpm
space,not_removed,its basically because the earth and jupiter are moving relative to each other in fact right now jupiter is moving at about mph kph relative to the earth theres also some funkiness in how the relative speeds are calculated since the orbit insertion is polar moving from north pole to south pole heres the blurb on mission purpose from the wikipedia page the spacecraft is to be placed in a polar orbit to study jupiters composition gravity field magnetic field and polar magnetosphere juno will also search for clues about how the planet formed including whether it has a rocky core the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere how its mass is distributed and its deep winds which can reach speeds of kilometers per hour mph
space,not_removed,a science orbit is around days i dont know the schedule exactly but my guess is theyll be do some science on the capture orbit but will my mostly focusing on checking out all of the spacecraft systems to make sure the spacecraft is healthy
space,not_removed,no landing is involved because jupiter is a gas giant and has no rocky surface to land on july is the day they perform a critical main engine burn to slow the spacecraft down enough so that it enters an orbit around jupiter edit also joi happening on july is a total coincidence due to launch scheduling
space,not_removed,its worth noting that on the outleg of junos initial orbit before the earth gravity assist there is a deep space maneuver where they use the engine to correct the trajectory and make sure it enters the gravity assist correctly
space,not_removed,the concern is about biological contamination one scenario we want to avoid is something like the invasive species scenario we occasionally see here on earth what if there is life on one of the moons but some stowaway bacteria destroys it all due to contamination its particularly a concern if liquid water is a possibility on the moons
space,not_removed,the sheer energy required to overcome the gravitational bonding energy of jupiter ie split it and keep it from rejoining is more energy than we will likely ever be capable of i dont even think enough energy physically exists on earth so no blowing up jupiter would destroy the solar system if it was possible theres a reason we dont get many asteroids hint its jupiter
space,not_removed,maybe these links will be handy in understanding jupiters radiation the rotation is to help stabilize the spacecraft its the same angular conservation principle that keeps bicycles stable the faster the wheels spin
space,not_removed,not sure where youre getting the idea that its a day mission juno will be orbiting from july to february
space,not_removed,junocam is not a camera in the normal sense its a pushframe camera meaning it relies on the spacecrafts rotation while recording a strip of imagery as a result it has a fixed width of pixels but not really a fixed height heres some more info on junocam not sure what the data rates will be during end of mission
space,not_removed,i dont believe the spacecraft will ever stop spinning even during attitude changes the spacecraft spins for stability in the same way a bicycle is more stable the faster the wheels spin
space,not_removed,its hard to visualize the distances on a small screen maybe this will help show the perijove distance better httpsgfycatcomwetraregelada
space,not_removed,its gfycats way of creating unique and memorable urls
space,not_removed,definitely misspoke
space,not_removed,looks like about miles more specifically according to jupiter orbit insertion is performed at the close approach of the trajectory called perijove this point has to be targeted precisely and is planned to be kilometers above the level of the gas planet if orbit insertion has occurred at a higher altitude a perigee lowering maneuver would have been required to achieve the science orbit which would have negative consequences for the dvbudget of the mission that was a major factor for juno spacecraft design
space,not_removed,no in fact they purposefully do a retrograde burn so that juno will crash into jupiter
space,not_removed,thats exactly what it did
space,not_removed,nothing just floats along out there without fuel or other means to adjust a crafts trajectory there is no way to control where it will crash to much fuel would be needed to push it far enough away from everything so they take all the unknowns out by crashing it
space,not_removed,theyre worried that the spacecraft might be harboring bacteria or viruses or some other biological contaminant despite httpsenwikipediaorgwikiplanetaryprotection if left in orbit the spacecraft will die eventually either due to battery failure electronics being fried by radiation running out of thruster fuel for attitude adjustments etc in that situation nasa no longer has control of the spacecraft meaning given time and orbital dynamics the spacecraft could end up crashing onto a moon like httpsenwikipediaorgwikieuropamoonpotentialhabitability or httpsenwikipediaorgwikicallistomoonpotentialhabitability and contaminating the moon
space,not_removed,this probe was not sterilized if it crashes on one of moons it could contaminate life on that moon if it exists
space,not_removed,that would be interesting since jupiter is a gas giant theres no surface as we know it think star wars cloud city
space,not_removed,do you mean httpwiworgjessimagesrwautographjpg
space,not_removed,theres no surface to land on in jupiter also the spacecraft will eventually die due to the harsh environment its in the radiation will fry the electronics the batteries will die eventually the spacecraft will eventually run out of fuel meaning it cant control its orientation or orbit nasa would rather have it purposefully crash into jupiter instead of risk having juno accidentally crash into a moon like europa or callisto and potentially contaminate the moon this answer here has a decent summary
space,not_removed,negative points people please i was just kidding sarcasm man
space,not_removed,as jupiter is a gas giant where will it crash into the core edit found the answer
space,not_removed,will you be able to see a flash of light through a telescope from earth on impact
space,not_removed,i am still disappointing that one of the two radio channels failed and so we never got pictures from the probe as it descended into jupiter
space,not_removed,which we do to protect places like europa from contaminants
space,not_removed,wrong planet and wrong mythology broski
space,not_removed,this is correct i was dating a navigation engineer working on cassini and their team really wants to burn to depletion to see how much fuel the spacecraft has left but they cant because the science team worries it will interfere with their instruments cant wait theres going to be some amazing photos taken between the planet and its rings
space,not_removed,too bad its at the wrong angle to crash into the grs that would be a great way to go out
space,not_removed,well actually thats just jupiters upper atmosphere i mean sure there are only traces in the atmosphere but then there are only tiny traces of metals in our atmosphere as well thats pretty normal but jupiters magnetic field is many times stronger than our own so based on that we can assume it also has a large metallic core again much larger than our own honestly when it comes to elemental makeup it seems to me that planets and perhaps even stars all have pretty similar composition gas giants are like earth x mars is like earth x venus is pretty similar to earth they all have varying chemical compositions but with similar solidliquidgas distribution and with most of the periodic table present to some extent
space,not_removed,wait is this actually a theory just checked roswell incident happened mid and first transistor discovered december
space,not_removed,isnt that contaminating jupiter though
space,not_removed,you could make molds of your plastic ones and cast them in aluminum easily enough
space,not_removed,playing ksp is finally paying off
space,not_removed,three years ago we all did our part to lift juno closer to jupiter good job guys
space,not_removed,oh come on theres no need for insults
space,not_removed,proud to be in the middle of that curve not higher nor lower
space,not_removed,haha i love that juno is listening to old scifi radio shows
space,not_removed,i know you didnt write the press kit but do you if they despin it prior to changing its attitude
space,not_removed,achieving a tight circular orbit thats always miles off the surface probably would require too much fuel which would make the spacecraft more expensive and more difficult to design thats what i thought but wasnt positive on that i was not aware of jupiters radiation output thanks for the clarification
space,not_removed,oh ya i realize it is incredibly complex and down right impressive that they are able to plan it so well and get such a highly eccentric orbit with such a precise period i believe i read some where that they will be able to map of jupiters atmosphere by the end of the mission presumably meaning every bit of the surface will pass underneath the craft and i was really making a jok about the second gif it shows a simple burn at periapsis and the layout reminds me of ksp edit fat fingered the submit button before i was done commenting
space,not_removed,terms like perijove kind of annoy me theres no reason we need distinct vocabulary for the same concept on each planet itd be like left turns on the highway in chicago being called chilefts while being called nylefts in new york it just complicates things for no functional reason
space,not_removed,okay that explains it at work so no app downloading yet ill get that on my home laptop thank you
space,not_removed,ah okay completely forgot that its a polar orbit that helps me visualize it thanks for the info
space,not_removed,thanks for the additional info i kind of assumed that they could make in flight adjustments at some point but still with the insanely large distances just a slight push left or right must change the trajectory dramatically
space,not_removed,ohhh is that the case i got confused by the joi which is from july to july my bad
space,not_removed,oh gotcha i think i saw a decimal when it was actually a comma in the gif thanks
space,not_removed,contaminate or seed they dont want the earth to be conquered by our bacterial descendants in a few billion years
space,not_removed,this might be a stupid question but why arent they afraid of contaminating jupiter by landing on it is it because of all of the radiation and the fact that it has no potential to be habitable
space,not_removed,running out of thruster fuel for attitude adjustments i was not aware of the wrestling capabilities of the spacecraft
space,not_removed,this is probably a stupid question but have we dismissed any possibility of life on jupiter too then if were going to crash it there
space,not_removed,its a multi layered atmosphere of heavier and heavier gases it definitely wont make it to the core it will disintegrate pretty soon after entering
space,not_removed,one or more of four things i dont know the math so i cant say whether this is a certainty satellites arent renowned for their aerodynamic properties juno will get ripped up likely in seconds it or the debris will burn up depends entirely on the entrance velocity hence friction with the gasses and therefore temperature and the oxidation state of the jupiter atmosphere at the very least it will melt the julian race gets very angry
space,not_removed,itll burn up in the atmosphere for one jupiters gravity is very much stronger than earths so the speed of objects entering the atmosphere is very much higher as well nearly kms because kinetic energy scales with the square of velocity that translates to a lot more energy that is released during atmospheric entry more than enough to vaporize the probe rather quickly additionally jupiters atmosphere just gets thicker and thicker as you go down and hotter as well it doesnt take long before whatever is left of the spacecraft is crushed and melted
space,not_removed,it wont really go anywhere it will be completely destroyed and its constituent elements blended in with jupiters many density layers this will all happen the instant it touches jupiters atmosphere so it wont go very far into jupiter in one piece
space,not_removed,here is some perspective to add onto what heywire is talking about this is an asteroid that hit jupiter and created an explosion about the size of the earth juno spacecraft probably wouldnt even be half a pixel in that video
space,not_removed,jupiter is far too big and far away for anything like a measly earthling space probe burning up to be detectable from here take a look at what was able to do with huge wide fragments
space,not_removed,the radio channels issue was huygens and cassini not galileo we did get pictures from huygens and the galileo probe didnt even have a camera
space,not_removed,and thats my last bacardi
space,not_removed,a magnetic field can be created with an electric current when under extreme pressure it is hypothesized that hydrogen becomes a conductive substance no iron necessary to have a huge magnetic field
space,not_removed,i seriously doubt aliens crashed on our planet with a craft that was using transistor technology
space,not_removed,if aliens were advanced enough to come to earth the transistors used in their electronics would probably be much too small to discern with any technology available in the
space,not_removed,i want to say no because it will completely burn up in jupiters atmosphere moons have really thin atmospheres which wouldnt allow the spacecraft to burn up on descent this is my guess
space,not_removed,someone seriously downvoted this i understand this is a serious science subreddit but its not unthinkable that a game could help someone understand some of these concepts as well as a textbook could sure its no substitute for a graduate level course but if a game can get people interested in and understanding of some of these concepts that should be viewed as something extremely positive
space,not_removed,i dont believe so the attitude changes should be done while spinning i cant say that but thats been the case with other spacecraft
space,not_removed,yea i know what youre getting at though it boils down to some basic orbital maneuvers on the note about mapping the orbit is cleverly designed to get very good complete coverage in jupiters fixed frame
space,not_removed,yea basically when it comes to life the questions always center around liquid water which is why searching for evidence of water on mars has been such a focal point of mars exploration both europa and callisto have potential for liquid water httpsenwikipediaorgwikieuropamoonpotentialhabitability httpsenwikipediaorgwikicallistomoonpotentialhabitability this isnt really a concern with jupiter because its a gas giant meaning it doesnt have a rocky surface
space,not_removed,the spacecraft will be vaporized as it hits the top of jupiters atmosphere solar panels instruments batteries and even any life thats survived the journey that faritll be utterly vaporized with a slam into the atmosphere of jupiter
space,not_removed,wouldnt it be jovian race x
space,not_removed,thanks for that video i had no idea that happened
space,not_removed,lets hope jupiter keeps taking more for the team
space,not_removed,oops thats right such a shame pictures from the edge of jupiter would have been amazing
space,not_removed,it was the style man everything was all tubes
space,not_removed,i think the transistor will always be in use i dont think it will become outdated
space,not_removed,why do you think they crashed
space,not_removed,why would the government give the public alien grade transistors anyway
space,not_removed,unless they sent it intentionally to show us or they knew ruggedised transistor circuits were more likely to last the thousands to millions of years waiting time while travelling through space
space,not_removed,trust me any alien dumb enough to crash on earth is going to have the equivalent of a vintage guitar and amp on board too just some hippydippy alien looking to slum with the backwards humans they dont even have wifi how retro
space,not_removed,makes sense my only qualm is that isnt the whole point of this mission to find out what is inside jupiter since we dont know maybe we know about the outer atmosphere and that its thick enough to burn up juno though
space,not_removed,after that game insertion burns like the one in the gif make so much more sense im just surprised on how close they get to jupiter in the first place only miles half way through their burn
space,not_removed,i dont fucking get it im a third year astronautical engineering student and i love hearing that people care about space and like learning about things like upcoming missions or some basic orbital mechanics it really shows people how the crazy things that the we do in space are done the world doesnt know enough about space i cant tell you how men grown men and women ive explained what and orbit is to so many people think the iss and other satellites are just floating there and they love finding out how they really work the look on someones face when they finally understand something that they always figured was way too complicated for them to grasp is amazing but im getting sidetracked i think my point is that too many people think because they learned about something in a book or because theyre knowledge is deeper than someone elses in a subject they can just belittle others ksp has done an awesome thing its taught so many people actual rocket science i mean no most people arent doing math when they play the game i say most but some actually do but my god so many people now know what things like prograde burns and polar orbits are because of a video game its sparks an interest in people and i love it i just absolutely fucking love space and everyone should
space,not_removed,no i think people probably downvoted it because they get tired of every single time somebody mentions orbital mechanics rocket designfailures engine placement etc somebody or multiple people bring up ksp im not saying its not a fantastic game but its like saying does it run crysis
space,not_removed,rspace serious science subreddit nothing could be further from the truth
space,not_removed,i havent played it yet but i hear that this game is the most detailed space related game in terms of the physics involved etc
space,not_removed,yes that was exactly what i was invisioning except ive only ever really that type of orbit path represented on a flat map i had no idea so many renderings and animations were available online like that i guess i know what im doing with the rest of my night thank you
space,not_removed,i even googled that shit to make sure ill leave it there as a mark of disgrace
space,not_removed,erm do you know about this httpsenwikipediaorgwikicometshoemaker–
space,not_removed,the aliens wore onions on their belts which was the style at the time
space,not_removed,hipsters are a problem for every sentient species
space,not_removed,its all ball bearings nowadays
space,not_removed,its all about those memristors son
space,not_removed,those would be saved for use on the arvs
space,not_removed,itd be much more feasible to build adequate shielding
space,not_removed,apparently so it will be awesome when or if we find a way to send something that allows us to see videotake scientific readings plummeting through jupiters atmosphere that will not burn up on decent also it would have to have the ability to somehow transmit this valuable information back to us on earth its not looking promising but you never know what the future holds
space,not_removed,agreed ive looked at these things in the past and been completely baffled and amazed at the complexity of these missions picked up kerbal after the tutorials and after a few hours launching my pathetic probes and landers i can understand gravity whips and how you enteradjust an orbit its a childish game on the surface but its a pretty serious science simulator under the hood and yes i got into it from reading comments here like this one warning it is very addictive i finally managed to go coldturkey after i landed on mars httpiimgurcomatqloxopng
space,not_removed,damn bro i get that the game uses very realistic physics but why are you so salty about that hahaha
space,not_removed,yeah people should just not talk about whats important to them
space,not_removed,nuuuuu i didnt mean to disgrace
space,not_removed,anyways i got on the ferry to shelbyville gimmie bees i said which was the style at the time
space,not_removed,the tubes give the navigation computer warmer calculations transistorized computers just have no soul these days
space,not_removed,cant say im familiar with arvs
space,not_removed,i got sucked in for a year and a half of serious playing my was my last real mission full hardmode rules deadly reentry life support no reverts no quickloads unless ksp itself crashes intense way to play my most successful mission under these rules my favorite writeup was
space,not_removed,strange thats what you got out of my explanation but ok its not that they are talking about it but rather that its just a throwaway line in every thread even tangentially related to space if they talked about what they learned that probably wouldnt be downvoted
space,not_removed,yeah i get to be that guy unless you are talking about a mechanical computer a la babbage both tube based and solidstate computers use transistors tubes using anodes and cathodes in a vacuum and solidstate using usually doped silicone or germanium in that case of the first solidstate one
space,not_removed,that was a fun read but the eve attempt saddened me greatly
space,not_removed,i could give a fuck about the down votes but i dont want you to think im antagonizing you thats their loss though i guess ignorance isnt always bliss
space,not_removed,every thread even tangentially related to space nice hyperbole there mate or do you not visit this sub ever
space,not_removed,yes you successfully recognized hyperbole in the initial post i said every single time somebody mentions orbital mechanics rocket designfailures engine placement etc which while still hyperbole is not so far off
space,not_removed,yay i did something successfully sorry if i came off aggressive it was really late when i posted that
space,not_removed,link to original this pic explains nothing ah its boundary layer ingestion already used in marine applications but its been difficult to do in air httpinterestingengineeringcomnasaincreaseseffeciencywithnewpropulsor
space,not_removed,i apologize i was just browsing on the nasa site and thought it was beautiful this was lazy posting ill admit
space,not_removed,cool ive done that too if you have the actual nasa link that would be great i couldnt find it
space,not_removed,httpswwwnasagovimagefeaturebreakingboundariesinnewenginedesigns
space,not_removed,cool thanks interesting stuff the link on that page also shows a really odd airplane that uses related aerodynamics apparently technology marches on quicker every year
space,not_removed,it sure does and most of it is way over my head but that doesnt have to stop me from being amazed by it
space,not_removed,ive read where universities in europe paid over for meteorites that fell in north africa a few years ago because they were fresh and very very valuable my guess is the tribe didnt know that
space,not_removed,i converted public hststis fuv data into animated gifs
space,not_removed,just saw this today
space,not_removed,one of the first papers from nasa said the drive may be pushing on the mesh in space consisting of the particles and antiparticles that are popping into existence and annihilating each other the bottom line is they dont now how it works and it should not work because it violates newtons third law the thrust coming out of the testing apparatus is so low that even with the highly controlled vaccum environments the thrust could be caused by something as minor as the heat given off by the microwaves what i dont understand is why they dont hook one of these drives up to amps and blast it all on full power to see what it can do another possibility is that they know it works with or without knowing exactly why and discovery of such a breakthrough has serious national security implications for space travel and satellite orbit maintenance and that they are purposefully obfuscating their real findings
space,not_removed,is there any insight into how this might work since it seems to defy the most basic principles of propulsion who is this guy and how did he make this potential discovery edit did more readings the propulsion was minimal probably error
space,not_removed,i think its very important to understand how it works even if it turns out its not producing thrust
space,not_removed,assuming emdrives work what would be the real world difference be compared to an ion drive
space,not_removed,cant wait until they just disclose antigravity this whole controlled progress is getting annoying but i guess its easier to downvote than to actually have an intelligent conversation keep em coming
space,not_removed,the bottom line is they dont now how it works and it should not work because it violates newtons third law if its pushing against the quantum vacuum or if its a gravitational effect pushing against distant objects or if its pushing against dark matter then its not violating the third law its just pushing against something that usually we dont see or consider in fact the proponents of the drive dont think that its violating the third law just that its pushing against hidden stuff
space,not_removed,any idea what power levels would be required to generate a newton of force
space,not_removed,just hook it directly to the full output of a nuclear power station and see if it acts like a bottle rocket then i again i think most things would move one way or another if you did that
space,not_removed,they either dont know why the hell some of the thrust isnt accounted for or they do know and arent telling us it is possible that the paper may have some sort of explanation into their theories or discoveries of how it works
space,not_removed,two theories that have already surfaced its a lowgrade sublight httpsenwikipediaorgwikialcubierredrive its a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiquantumvacuumthruster both are theoretical predictions that either predate the em drive or appeared when it was not famous yet
space,not_removed,the same error made in several different labs in different counties performing experiments of different designs this is not going to be explained by some simple lab measurement or math error something much more interesting than that is going on
space,not_removed,one wacky idea is mihsc modified inertia through a hubble scale cassimir effect see not endorsing fyi its interesting and probably wrong though it has some very appealing features ill leave it to actual physicists to yelp us how its wrong
space,not_removed,shawyer claims the thrust is a result of radiation pressure imbalances between the two faces of the cavity cone sonny white thinks it works by creating a virtual plasma toroid that realizes thrust using magnetohydrodynamic forces acting on quantum vacuum fluctuations same stuff presumed to have allowed matter to clump in the early universe in truth nobody has a clue how it produces thrust i believe the next step will be to test a small prototype launched with an iss resupply or something one nice thing about this simplistic design is that it isnt very heavy and could theoretically be testedmeasured using equipment already aboard the iss
space,not_removed,no propellent ion drives use propellant in the form of an inert gas that is ionised and shot out the back simplification if the emdrive works and it probably wont it wont use any propellant at all just electricity
space,not_removed,its night vs day one is a standard propellantdriven engine the other would have no propellant adding weight and assuming sufficient power generation could operate indefinitely with unlimited range sticking this thing on satellites for slight corrections or space observatories to maintain halo orbits that are slightly unstable would be awesomeas it continually produces ththrustwith no propellant it could continually accelerate without concern to fuel reserves if its real its a total game changer
space,not_removed,shawyer the person who came up with the original design claims that theoretically ludicrous thrustpower ratios should be possible that would allow the em drive to propel pretty much anything think flying aircraft carriers flying people flying cars flying everything really
space,not_removed,go back to
space,not_removed,i still think they know more about what is happening than they are letting on the thing moves there is no question about it the chinese are also conducting experiments with the drive so we will know whether it works sooner or later
space,not_removed,the problem is youd go to build a rf cavity and instead of heating your burrito youd heat whatever exotic particles you imagine are interacting with microwaves and making the emdrive work these momentum thieves cannot be very stealthy by particle physics standards compared to finding the neutrino through careful accounting of missing energy this would be easy and would have been done in the you cant really win this either its deleting momentum or its not and both of those options are eventually going to get in the way of very basic physics
space,not_removed,with the room temperature em drive it would take in theory about kw of power to generate a newton of force the reason they cant do this is because of heat dissipation getting rid of kw of heat continuously would be very challenging roger shawyer claims an improved version of the em drive can be achieved using a superconductor to reduce resistive losses in the chamber he claims this new design can get on the order of tonnekw which would mean newton could be achieved with mw of power
space,not_removed,roger shawyer the guy who proposed the concept says this i daresay america will have a lot to say about it but its not really new its all been done before years ago if you bother to go through the papers you can see the levels of thrust we achieved are significantly higher than the levels of thrust that nasa eagleworks has got he said people all around the world have been measuring thrust youve got guys building them in their garages and very large organisations building cavities too theyre all generating thrust theres no great mystery people think its black magic or something but its not any physicist worth his salt should understand how it works or if they dont they should change their profession emphasis mine taken from here are his research papers now declassified not sure if they explain anything httpwwwemdrivecom
space,not_removed,i hope so but all the experiments i found only resulted in movement by microns or millimeters if this thing can really move why dont they have it go for meters or more obviously im not a scientist there may be lots of reasons why i want this to be a breakthrough so bad
space,not_removed,but it would still need a power source so either a nuclear reactor or fuel to run a generator unless we can make it efficient enough to use solar power
space,not_removed,i am not sure of whats your point but if you are implying that people would have detected this decades ago because their microwave ovens would hover and fly across the kitchen thats not the case the effect is minuscule and it was only found because there was people crazy enough to think that it could exist and look for it with careful measurements and talking about microwave ovens percy spencer the inventor of the device found the heating effect by accident he was a radar operator in and noticed that his candy bars would warm if it was left too close of the machinery breaking news science cant predict everything and a lot of our current tech is serendipitous
space,not_removed,would it be easier or harder to implement superconductors in space
space,not_removed,yeah but his design was tested and they found out that if you removed certain parts which he claimed essential it continued working
space,not_removed,thats like asking why the wright brothers didnt bother building a strealth jet fighter after they built their first airplane this tech is still basically in its infancy
space,not_removed,depends on the application i imagine a drive like this might be useful on the iss for example spare power could drive the device and to maintain their altitude would take by my estimate kw which is about to of the total power that the iss produces for achieving orbit or long missions its a different story altogether
space,not_removed,if empty or apparentlyempty space sapped energy from microwaves then radio astronomy wouldnt work
space,not_removed,harder cooling stuff down in space is hard
space,not_removed,im not trying to vouch for him in my opinion the condescension in his words suggests a lack of understanding on his part
space,not_removed,that was the fins from the cannae drive not shayers emdrive design
space,not_removed,you are assuming that the effect appears naturally in empty open space that may well not be the case theres lot of weird stuff that happens only in properly designed cavities for instance a known quantum vacuum phenomenon like the httpsenwikipediaorgwikicasimireffect appears in any detectable way just if you make a sandwich of vacuum between two metal plates
space,not_removed,but couldnt you insulate the hot bits from the cool bits
space,not_removed,thrust has been reported for a wide variety of cavity shapes the effect cannot be too finicky the casimir effect is not helpful because it takes place at small scales and does nothing to explain an apparent asymmetry physics is built upon symmetry if you want this idea to be taken seriously you want to either somehow preserve that symmetry or tear it all down
space,not_removed,not really the cool bits are heating up and you need to keep them very cold that means drawing heat away from cold things which takes a lot of energy
space,not_removed,thats tough for russia dropping down the ranks but dont most of the us ula launches use the russian in which case you could argue that russia is still launching more vehicles into space than anyone else i mean if you wanted to argue that is i also believe that the chinese long march is based on the i know its just arguing semantics but it is interesting that although the russian economy is so bad and russia bashing is all the rage that their old rocker engines are still viable
space,not_removed,not correct russia fell behind the usa between and again between this is the first time that russia has fallen behind china the headline is somewhat disengenuous
space,not_removed,true atlas v and antares use russian engines and they account for launches it really is impressive how long russias engine technology has been in use around the world
space,not_removed,plus arianespace launched two soyuz from french guyana in httpwwwarianespacecommissions
space,not_removed,a correction was added to the article correction an earlier version of this story incorrectly reported as roscosmos did that is the first year russia fell behind the us in launches in fact the soviet union was initially behind the us from about to and briefly again during the late interesting that roscosmos reported it incorrectly as well
space,not_removed,it truly is there is something to be said for good solid technology in this throwaway world over engineering still stands out
space,not_removed,i guess stats are used by people for their own ends sometimes
space,not_removed,i wouldnt exactly call soviet engines underengineered kuznetsov and later glushko used a turbopump system assumed by many to be too complex to work and several times the chamber pressure
space,not_removed,i dont believe uextendedsceptic was suggesting they were underengineered i read their post as praising the engineering was i mistaken
space,not_removed,i believe you might reread my comment sir i use overengineered as a sign of quality as oppossed to the current make it as cheap as possible and hope it dont break in the first use type products that have become the norm
space,not_removed,overengineered is equal to high quality as oppossed to the throw away plastic crap that somehow has become the norm in todays society
space,not_removed,yup it sounded like thought you were suggesting sovietrussian engines were of the underengineered low quality variety
space,not_removed,short comments can often affirm bias on reddit its just one of those things we are all biased and sometimes we read stuff wrongly especially if we have been a while surfing reddit comments its not a problem
space,not_removed,how dare you my mother was a saint p agreed re reading what we expect to see take care
space,not_removed,currently there is a new coffee machine aboard the iss it has been dubbed isspresso it was built by the italian space agencyargotec and coffee company lavazza and was delivered a few months ago to the station by a spacex cargo vehicle the machine utilizes individual coffee capsules to make the coffee much like those coffee machines many people have that brew individual cups of coffee at home on earth the coffee flavoring capsules combine with hot water under high pressure to infuse the flavor into the water and the finished hot liquid product is expelled from the machine into an attached drink pouch or more recently even into a newfangled zerog coffee cup to drink the coffee they use either which utilizes a oneway straw so they can suck or squeeze the liquid out into their mouths alternatively they can now use a zerog coffee cup i believe there are six of these new cups aboard the iss currently in space coffee would cling to the sides of a regular cup due to surface tension and capillary effects so these special zerog coffee cups are designed to exploit the capillary action to allow the liquid to climb the walls of the cup according to fluid physicist mark weislogel who helped design the cups basically the liquid piles up right at the lip of the cup and keeps flowing as you sip it pours out by the combined effects of your mouth the wetting conditions of the fluid surface tension and the particular shape of the cup
space,not_removed,httpwwwpopscicomspacebrewerletsastronautsmakerealcoffeeatlast its been freeze dried in a pouch that hot water gets injected into now they have access to slightlymorereal coffee im sure this will be an ongoing thing seems like the positive psychological impact of having good coffee would be significant
space,not_removed,how does heat exchange work on the iss i find that when my coffee comes out it is way too hot to drink without damaging my mouth does the cup of coffee cool just the same as it would on earth
space,not_removed,i know they drink it out of specially designed ed ripped cups that hold the liquid with surface tension
space,not_removed,jesus those cups are cool
space,not_removed,those zerog coffee cups look a little bit too much like
space,not_removed,heh i figured theyd just take caffeine ltheanine for occasional stimulant use
space,not_removed,paging james holden httpswwwredditcomrtheexpanse
space,not_removed,the heat would radiate out in a sphere because the hot air doesnt rise it would be more insulated than on earth and cool slower but it would cool as the sphere of hot air around it gets larger and larger they have to provide more ventilation for equipment to keep it from overheating
space,not_removed,i was primed to throw in an expanse reference but didnt kudos to you sir one of the best shows on tv
space,not_removed,i think you mean captain janeway
space,not_removed,interesting thank you for your response
space,not_removed,they have to provide more ventilation for equipment to keep it from overheating actually in the us modules cabin air circulation is more for the crew the equipment racks on all four sides of the module are mostly cooled by cold plates which circulate water various pieces of equipment are attached to the cold plates and are cooled by conduction the water loops in turn go to heat exchangers outside the modules which use an ammonia loop the ammonia flows to radiator panels on the truss which radiates excess heat to space using air to cool the equipment racks would be a too noisy the modules are aluminum cans and the fan noise would be unbearable and b not work if the module loses pressure some of the rack equipment is required to keep working even if the module loses pressure source i helped build the us modules at boeing
space,not_removed,forgive me i should have said additional cooling rather than additional ventilation the point was that heat does not dissipate in the same way it does on earth requiring additional measures
space,not_removed,red dead planet cowboys in the one place that hasnt been corrupted by capitalism space
space,not_removed,actually low earth orbit at last is fairly corrupted by a great amount of debris left there by what is usually called capitalism but also by what some have called state capitalism i prefer the term bureaucratic collectivism so at least in terms of the near neighbourhood its too late to avoid corruption plans to clean up the garbage have been proposed but never acted upon
space,not_removed,plans to clean up the space capitalism byproduct have been thwarted again by capitalism itself noone will do it because theres no immediate and huge profit in it and worse it might even benefit someone other than the one spending money cleaning it
space,not_removed,appears to be a picture of our galaxy rather than the cosmos or the universe
space,not_removed,feb saw space shuttle discovery jaxas htv spacecraft esas atv spacecraft soyuzs and a progress all docked to the iss at once
space,not_removed,between spaceships and the bigillow the iss has to be the biggest its ever been
space,not_removed,has this happened before whats their purpose are some just glorified closets
space,not_removed,i hate how my wife flies around for or minutes trying to find a closer parking space when you could just dock on the far side of the station and walk for one minute
space,not_removed,they are going to decommission the thing why cant we just keep extending the whole structure i remember reading this comic by bajram universal war one where they never stopped making it bigger and bigger in the end they call it station alpha and have their own centenary celebrations etc etc
